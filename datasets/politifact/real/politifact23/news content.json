Quite a run!\n\nAnd now, working from City Hall, Rudolph William Giuliani, 53, has become New York's one ubiquitous figure, hurrying from a burned-out building to a subway derailment to the bedside of a wounded police officer. He is Gotham's action hero, self-cast as the take-charge guy who is reliably among the first at every scene.\n\nBy most reckonings, including those of many adversaries, Mr. Giuliani has coupled this celebrity with effective leadership. A seemingly ungovernable city now seems responsive to discipline, its crime rate in a plunge, its tourist-stocked streets palpably safer.\n\nStill, however many his accomplishments, there is something else striking about the Mayor: his temperament. He seems to believe in mayoral infallibility, at least so long as he is the Mayor. To question his righteousness is to risk his wrath. A devil's advocate often seems regarded as the devil himself.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=1997"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=1997", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Barry Bearak", "Ian Fisher"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/19/nyregion/race-for-city-hall-republican-candidate-mercurial-mayor-s-confident-journey.html", "title": "RACE FOR CITY HALL: The Republican Candidate; A Mercurial Mayor's Confident Journey", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Biographical sketch of New York City Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani traces his rise to City Hall from his childhood in East Flatbush, Brooklyn; notes that he was born on May 28, 1944, grandson of Italian immigrants, and was Federal prosecutor; photos (M)", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/19/nyregion/race-for-city-hall-republican-candidate-mercurial-mayor-s-confident-journey.html", "title": "RACE FOR CITY HALL: The Republican Candidate; A Mercurial Mayor's Confident Journey (Published 1997)", "description": "Biographical sketch of New York City Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani traces his rise to City Hall from his childhood in East Flatbush, Brooklyn; notes that he was born on May 28, 1944, grandson of Italian immigrants, and was Federal prosecutor; photos (M)", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultCrop.png?year=1997", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/71834313-7d3d-54b1-b309-75c772008545"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/19/nyregion/race-for-city-hall-republican-candidate-mercurial-mayor-s-confident-journey.html", "type": "article", "title": "RACE FOR CITY HALL: The Republican Candidate; A Mercurial Mayor's Confident Journey (Published 1997)", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=1997", "description": "Biographical sketch of New York City Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani traces his rise to City Hall from his childhood in East Flatbush, Brooklyn; notes that he was born on May 28, 1944, grandson of Italian immigrants, and was Federal prosecutor; photos (M)"}, "article": {"published_time": "1997-10-19T05:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "1997-10-19T05:00:00.000Z", "section": "New York", "author": "https://www.nytimes.com/by/ian-fisher", "tag": "Elections", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 1997101900000689378, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/71834313-7d3d-54b1-b309-75c772008545", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/68f822080160459abc2122f3925fc646", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/newsgraphics/images/icons/defaultPromoCrop.png?year=1997", "byl": "By Barry Bearak and Ian Fisher", "news_keywords": "NYC;New York City,Rudolph W Giuliani,Mayor,Biographical Information,Election", "pdate": 19971019, "CG": "nyregion", "PT": "article", "PST": "Biography", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/19/nyregion/race-for-city-hall-republican-candidate-mercurial-mayor-s-confident-journey.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/71834313-7d3d-54b1-b309-75c772008545", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/19/nyregion/race-for-city-hall-republican-candidate-mercurial-mayor-s-confident-journey.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/19/nyregion/race-for-city-hall-republican-candidate-mercurial-mayor-s-confident-journey.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 877237200.0, "source": "http://query.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
