She gave an answer from her heart.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn her own remarks moments later, Prejean echoed Trump\u2019s statement, telling reporters: \u201cThe president of the United States, the secretary of state, and many Americans agree with me in this belief.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the final round of the Miss USA pageant, Prejean told judge Perez Hilton: \u201cI think in my country, in my family, I think that I believe that a marriage should be between a man and a woman. No offense to anybody out there, but that\u2019s how I was raised.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also", "images": ["https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/630/quality/90/format/webp?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-origin-images.politico.com%2Fnews%2F090512_trumpobama_comp2.jpg", "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-origin-images.politico.com%2Fnews%2F090512_trumpobama_comp2.jpg", "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/630/quality/90/format/webp?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F04%2F48%2F3959e96b4fe9819cc712f4cd826d%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2169804185"], "top_img": "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-origin-images.politico.com%2Fnews%2F090512_trumpobama_comp2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.politico.com/story/2009/05/trump-on-prejean-same-as-obama-022413", "title": "Trump on Prejean: Same as Obama", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "brightspot.contentId": "0000014e-a93e-df19-a1ee-bf7e50ac0015", "description": "Obama ends up in middle of an unlikely controversy \u2014 the debate over Miss California\u2019s position on gay marriage.", "keywords": "miss california,gop,miss america,opposite marriage", "og": {"description": "Obama ends up in middle of an unlikely controversy \u2014 the debate over Miss California\u2019s position on gay marriage.", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "image": "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-origin-images.politico.com%2Fnews%2F090512_trumpobama_comp2.jpg", "site_name": "POLITICO", "title": "Trump on Prejean: Same as Obama", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2009/05/trump-on-prejean-same-as-obama-022413"}, "title": "Trump on Prejean: Same as Obama - POLITICO", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico", "description": "Obama ends up in middle of an unlikely controversy \u2014 the debate over Miss California\u2019s position on gay marriage.", "image": "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-origin-images.politico.com%2Fnews%2F090512_trumpobama_comp2.jpg", "site": "@politico", "title": "Trump on Prejean: Same as Obama"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.politico.com", "summary": ""}
