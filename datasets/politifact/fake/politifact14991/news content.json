A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/Jeffrey-Epstein-pals-Bill-Clinton-and-Larry-Summers-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/AP25323639183115-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/spc-so-co-640x480-1-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/05/Donald-Trump-1-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/tycobbb5542-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/GettyImages-2243425398-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/GettyImages-2237911174-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/GettyImages2235109084-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/Hakeem-Jeffries-Jeffrey-Epstein-Barack-Obama-200x150.jpeg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/Tim-Ockenden-PA-Images_PA-Images-via-Getty-Images-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/GettyImages-2246588241-e1763550960224-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/Jasmine-Crockett-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/GettyImages-2246642752-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/Robert-Cekada-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/ice-arrests-los-angeles-flickr-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/GettyImages-2247441957-e1763561533997-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/Jasmine-Crockett-Misfires-on-Lee-Zeldin-200x150.jpeg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/GettyImages2247326217-200x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "theme-color": "#FF5500", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Rep.
