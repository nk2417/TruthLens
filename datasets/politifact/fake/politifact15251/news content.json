Extraordinary observations require extraordinary evidence. That\u2019s what Carl Sagan said.\n\n\u201cThere may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies. The probability is almost certain that there is life somewhere in space.\n\n\u201cIt was not that remarkable, that special, that unusual, that life here on earth evolved gradually, slowly, to where we are today.\u201d\n\nOn July 21, 1969, Neil Armstrong made history by becoming the first person to set foot on the earth\u2019s moon.\n\nUpon landing, he is famously quoted as saying: \u201cThat\u2019s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\u201d\n\nBuzz was on the same mission, Apollo 11, as Neil Armstrong and soon followed in his footsteps \u2013 making him the second man on the moon.\n\nRead up on the latest UFO conspiracies UF-WOAH Black ring hovering above Disneyland sparks UFO fears as fans left baffled\n\nIn total, Neil and Buzz were on the lunar surface for only 21 hours, 36 minutes and 21 seconds.\n\nPete Conrad was a moon walker on the Apollo 12 mission, which launched on November 14, 1969. He was partnered by Alan Bean.\n\nAlso on the Apollo 12 mission, was Alan Bean. He and Pete were on the moon for two days \u2013 November 19 and 20, 1969.", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000243467087.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000260562148.jpg?strip=all&w=612", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000001148105.jpg?strip=all&w=943", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000019068298-e1523183787771.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C1934px%2C1289px&resize=1920%2C1080", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000019068298.jpg?strip=all&w=763", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/disneyufo.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1763118126&w=300&h=192&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000019068298-e1523183787771.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C1934px%2C1289px&resize=1920%2C1080", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/5999912/buzz-aldrin-ufo-lie-detector-test-alien-life-exists-convinced/", "title": "Buzz Aldrin \u2018passes UFO lie detector test leaving experts convinced that he encountered alien life\u2019", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
