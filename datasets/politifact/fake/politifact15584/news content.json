The left hates our freedoms, and so designating the Declaration of Independence, the most magnificent document in all of human history, as hate speech is in line with their agenda. The left means to criminalize lawfulness. The left means to criminalize freedom of speech. The left means to criminalize individual rights. The left means to criminalize Americanism.\n\nIt starts with cultural assassination, delegitimization, dehumanization, then criminalization. Mark my words.\n\nFacebook labels declaration of independence as \u2018hate speech\u2019 The website told a local newspaper they violated its community guidelines by posting the original document ADVERTISEMENT What must have seemed like a benign social media strategy managed to fall foul of Facebook\u2019s algorithmic censors, which labeled sections of the declaration hate speech and removed the posts.\n\nThe Truth Must be Told Your contribution supports independent journalism Please take a moment to consider this.
