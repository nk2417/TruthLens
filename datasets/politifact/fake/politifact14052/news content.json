Sources have said that US President Donald Trump will soon issue an executive order to ban Facebook in the country. _O_n the other hand, even some Republican leaders said that they were opposed to the idea of Facebook \u2014 an American corporation \u2014 being banned in the country. _U_nfazed by the criticism from his own party members, Trump said that this move would fight fake news being circulated on social media websites. \u201cInside, we both know what\u2019s been going on. We know the game and we\u2019re gonna play it,\u201d said Trump.

AP[/caption] _G_overnance involves taking difficult steps, said the US president, adding that despite Facebook taking action against fake news, a lot of false stories and \u2018alternative facts\u2019 were still being circulated on the site. _O_ther social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order. _T_he people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion. _R_ick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President\u2019s \u201ccommitment\u201d should have not just been limited to Facebook. \u201cYou know the rules and so do I. A full commitment\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking of,\u201d Rowlinson said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t get this from any other guy,\u201d he added, shaking his head. _I_n California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move. _C_ourts in the US had earlier blocked Trump\u2019s travel ban executive order. _K_een on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump. _R_eacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US. _O_n Trump\u2019s claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news. _L_ast month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over \u2018blasphemous content\u2019. _L_ately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites. If Trump\u2019s executive order is passed, US will join the list of those countries. _E_mployees of Facebook are planning to start a signature campaign against the order if it gets passed. _D_onald Trump\u2019s remarks on Facebook and Zuckerberg\u2019s response has gone viral.
