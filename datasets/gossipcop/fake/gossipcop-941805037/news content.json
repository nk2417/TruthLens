During his candidacy, Trump promised he would release his taxes after the IRS completed their audit of them. He has not. (Note, Trump\u2019s 2016 taxes will immediately be under audit this year.)\n\nCritics believe that Trump\u2019s tax returns may disclose personal or financial ties that influenced the presidential campaign and/or the current administration. This comes as a Senate Intelligence Committee investigation is underway looking at ties between top Trump aides and Russia.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAs with the Women\u2019s March, some celebrities are protesting via social media. Here are some of their responses.\n\nAt a rally in New York City, Sarah Silverman addressed Trump directly. \u201cShow us your f\u2013king taxes, you emotional child.\u201d\n\n13 director Ava Duvernay shared photos of various signs, including one that echoed Silverman\u2019s expletive and another with a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d reference.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ava/status/853305641850486784\n\nAndy Richter also tweeted a graphic poster.\n\nMy daughter couldn't make it today but she made a sign for us to carry #TaxMarch #taxmarchla pic.twitter.com/QtbkzyRRd2 \u2014 Andy Richter (@AndyRichter) April 15, 2017\n\n\u201cCaptain America\u201d star Chris Evans simply posted \u201cliar\u201d and a clip to an interview where Trump said he would release his taxes.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ChrisEvans/status/853332025868025856\n\nActor Ike Barinholtz thanked the protesters and called out the fact that the President was making his 17th golf trip this weekend after 12 weeks in office.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ikebarinholtz/status/853317302963404800\n\nJon Cryer posted a shot of a sign that played on the \u201cStar Wars\u201d mania.\n\nThe President, an avid social media user, has yet to tweet a response to today\u2019s Tax March protests.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/taxivader.jpg?crop=0px%2C136px%2C1000px%2C557px&resize=1000%2C563", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/taxivader.jpg?w=1000&h=667&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/taxivader.jpg?crop=0px%2C136px%2C1000px%2C557px&resize=1000%2C563", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Variety Staff", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/tax-march-donald-trump-protest-1202031487/", "title": "Celebrities Join Tax March in Protest of Donald Trump", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Those protesting today are primarily calling for Trump to disclose his tax returns.
