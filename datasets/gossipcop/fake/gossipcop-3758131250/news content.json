He had two older sisters named Nicola and Ruth.[14][15] Payne was born three weeks premature and suffered frequent illnesses. Until the age of four, he had regular tests done in hospital as doctors noticed one of his kidneys was scarred and dysfunctional. In the book Dare to Dream: Life as One Direction, he mentioned that before he was four, \"I was always in hospital having tests done but they couldn't find out what was wrong. They discovered that one of my kidneys wasn't working properly and it had scarred. I had to have 32 injections in my arm in the morning and evening to try and make me better.\"[16][17]\n\nAs a student, Payne was heavily involved in sports, particularly cross-country running.

Where Tomlinson was known for his lyricism, Payne had a penchant for coming up with melodies.[102] He told Entertainment Weekly in 2015 that the two tracks he was most proud of were \"Better Than Words\" and \"What a Feeling\". The former is composed of titles from other songs, while he and Tomlinson wrote the latter inspired by Fleetwood Mac.[103]\n\nPayne was a pop[104] and R&B[105] singer who explored other genres, including electronic music.[106] He cited Chris Brown,[107] Pharrell Williams,[108] Justin Timberlake,[109] and Usher as being major musical influences.[110] Payne said, \"The person who has inspired me most is Pharrell Williams who I worked with a while back. I got talking to his producer recently and asked him what Pharrell was like when he was younger, and he said to me that when he was my age he couldn't press a note on a keyboard. And that was amazing to me because at 22 I thought I was too old to learn guitar.\"[111] His first exposure to rock music was through Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory with \"In the End\", as they were the gateway for him to listen to other types of music outside of what he would typically listen to as a child. Payne would label \"In the End\" as one of the most important songs of his life.[112]\n\nOther ventures\n\nPayne was named the first global brand ambassador for German brand Hugo Boss in May 2019.

In 2022, he captained the English team, and returned for the 2023 event.[142] Payne donated thousands of pounds to various GoFundMe pages in the month prior to his death.[143] In a Snapchat video uploaded at the time he explained, \"I've been going on night by night by night, trying to finish off people's donations so that they can get the operations they need.\"[143]\n\nPersonal life\n\nPayne for UNICEF in 2023\n\nLiam Payne started dating Danielle Peazer, a dancer on The X Factor, in 2010; he was 17 and she was 22.

In May 2019, amidst anti-abortion legislation passed in Alabama, he said that they were \"completely taking away the rights of women and the ownership of the bodies that belong to them\" and that \"... men never have to go through that so how can we even comment or decide what women should or shouldn't go through.\" He added \"here was me thinking it was supposed to be the land of the free (and) it all looks very tied up from where I'm standing\".[163] In May 2020, Payne expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement and encouraged fans to educate themselves and donate. He attended London Black Lives Matter protests.[164]\n\nHealth\n\nPayne had spoken about his struggles with alcoholism since the peak of One Direction's success. More specifically, he mentioned being locked in hotel rooms with a mini-bar between gigs.[12] In May 2023, Payne mentioned being sober for over three months. That July, he shared a video expanding on this, and he discussed spending 100 days in a rehab facility in Louisiana.[165][166][167] In August 2023, Payne was hospitalised with a kidney infection.[92]\n\nOn 1 June 2022, he was intoxicated while being interviewed by Logan Paul for his podcast series. Payne said that One Direction originated with a promise that Simon Cowell had made to him; Payne had previously appeared on the show, and Cowell purportedly pledged to \"make it work\" should he return. He also discussed former fellow member Zayn Malik's family life and said: \"There's many reasons why I dislike Zayn and there's many reasons why I'll always, always be on his side\".[168] He later clarified his remarks on Malik and apologised.[169]\n\nDeath\n\nA group of fans gathered outside the front of the CasaSur Hotel in Argentina, where Payne died.\n\nIn early October 2024,[170] Payne and his girlfriend Kate Cassidy travelled to Argentina to renew his United States O visa at the US embassy in Buenos Aires and to attend Horan's The Show: Live on Tour concert at the city's Movistar Arena.[171][172] He had posted about his intention to travel to Argentina in videos to his Snapchat account.[173] Cassidy returned to her home in Florida on 14 October, with Payne staying in Argentina.[174] A fan told reporters that Payne had approached them on 16 October and had appeared sober and discussed with them at length his time in Buenos Aires and his appreciation of the area.[175] Shortly before his death, he told another fan staying at the same hotel that \"I used to be in a boyband, that's why I'm so fucked up.\"[176][177][178]\n\nLater that day, Payne died after falling from a third-floor balcony at the CasaSur hotel in the Palermo neighbourhood of Buenos Aires.[179][180][181] Police went to the hotel following an emergency call from the hotel manager, who reported \"an aggressive man who could be under the effects of drugs and alcohol\".[179][182] The manager indicated in the call that \"when he is conscious he is destroying the entire room and we need you to send someone\", noting that the man's life was at risk due to the room having a balcony.[182][183] Minutes after emergency services arrived, Payne fell from the balcony and crashed to the ground.[172] His death was confirmed at 5:11 p.m..[179][184] The emergency medical team that arrived at the hotel reported a \"cranial fracture and extremely serious injuries\" that led to Payne's immediate death.[181][185]\n\nAlberto Crescenti, the director of Buenos Aires' public emergency medical service, announced Payne's death on the Argentine news channel TN, saying that the fall was from a height of approximately 13 to 14 metres (43 to 46 ft) and that Payne sustained \"very serious injuries incompatible with life\" leaving \"no possibility of resuscitation\".[179][183] Crescenti declined to comment on whether the death was a suicide or an accident.[183][186] Pablo Policicchio, communications director for the Buenos Aires Security Ministry, stated that Payne \"had jumped from the balcony of his room\".[183][167] The office did not respond to follow-up questions regarding the claim and directed the reporters to the prosecutor's office.[187] The forensic experts later reported that Payne \"did not adopt a reflexive posture to protect himself\" and that he \"could have fallen in a state of semi or total unconsciousness\".[188][189] According to Argentine journalist Paula Varela, citing unreleased CCTV footage, Payne accidentally fell to his death after fainting on the balcony.[190]\n\nPayne's body was initially interred at the Cementerio Brit\u00e1nico in Buenos Aires before being repatriated by air to the United Kingdom on 6 November.[191] His funeral was held on 20 November at Saint Mary's Church in Amersham, Buckinghamshire.[192][193]\n\nInvestigation\n\nAuthorities opened an investigation into Payne's death and conducted a post-mortem.[183] Police said that several medications and energy supplements were found in his room, including clonazepam, and that a whiskey bottle was found in the courtyard where his body was recovered.[194] Initial post-mortem examination indicated that Payne died from internal and external haemorrhages and multiple traumatic injuries.[195] The forensic experts reported 25 injuries caused by the fall and said that Payne's traumatic brain injuries were \"enough to cause death\", with bleeding in his head and upper body contributing to his death. The examination found no signs of a fight and noted that Payne was alone in the room at the time of his death.[196][197]\n\nThe media incorrectly reported that Payne had \"multiple substances\" in his system when he died, including pink cocaine, crack cocaine, and benzodiazepine.[198][199] However, on 22 October, Argentina's public prosecutor's office clarified that the toxicology report was not yet complete and denied that any details had been disclosed.[200][201] On the night of 23 October, a week after Payne's fall, Buenos Aires police raided the CasaSur Hotel, seeking documents and other information. A government official revealed police had seized items such as computers. Authorities requested the hotel hand over camera footage.[202][203] On 7 November, prosecutors said that post-mortem toxicological exams on Payne showed \"traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant\" prior to his death. That same day, Argentine police charged three people with \"abandonment of a person followed by death\" and \"supplying and facilitating the use of narcotics\" over Payne's death. The suspects were identified as: a companion of Payne; a hotel employee who provided cocaine to Payne while he was at the hotel; and a drug dealer.[204] On 8 January 2025, Payne's cause of death was confirmed in a UK inquest opening as polytrauma.[205]\n\nCriminal charges\n\nOn 30 December 2024, an Argentinean judge charged five people in connection with Payne's death. Two people, a waiter who met with Payne in a local restaurant and an employee of the hotel where Payne stayed at the time of his death, were charged with supplying Payne with the drugs he took shortly before his death and were ordered to be held in pre-trial detention at a preventive prison. Three others, a businessman who was with Payne in Argentina and two managers of the hotel, were charged with manslaughter.[206] On 20 February 2025, the manslaughter charges were dropped against the three suspects.[207]\n\nAftermath\n\nReactions\n\nPayne's family released a statement shortly after his death, stating that they were \"heartbroken\" and that Payne would \"live forever\" in their hearts, and asking for privacy as they supported each other.[208] Payne's father Geoff and One Direction's former head of security Paul Higgins arrived in Buenos Aires on 18 October.[209] His former partner Cheryl issued a public request for consideration and dignity, fearing their son could potentially access \"the abhorrent reports and media exploitation\" around his father's death later in life.[210] Payne's One Direction bandmates released a joint statement asking for time to speak more on his death and that they were grieving and processing it,[211] with individual statements of respect coming from each member and Styles' mother.[212][213][214] Malik later announced that he would be postponing the US leg of his Stairway to the Sky Tour following news of Payne's death.[215][216]\n\nMusicians across the world paid tribute to Payne.[217] A number of public figures, including Sharon Osbourne, Rebecca Ferguson, and Bruce Springsteen, raised concerns about the music industry, media, and adolescent fame in their commemorations.[218][219][220] Musician Robbie Williams, relating Payne's struggles to his own, made a plea for compassion, saying, \"We don't know what's going on in people's lives\".[221][222] Filming of auditions for series 18 of Britain's Got Talent, a show produced by Cowell, was suspended out of respect;[223] production resumed that weekend, with Cowell absent for some episodes.[224] Cowell himself paid tribute two days after Payne's death.[225] UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer released a statement mourning Payne and mentioning One Direction's \"huge impact on many millions of fans around the world\".[226] Wolverhampton councillor Simon Bennett said Payne should posthumously receive the Freedom of the City honour.[227] Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. and West Bromwich Albion paid tributes to Payne.[228][229]\n\nOn 18 October, a fan began a petition calling for \"Liam's Law\" to protect artists' mental health, which would enforce access to mental health professionals, regular mental health checks, and adequate rest periods. Within five days, their petition had been signed by over 68,000 people.[230][231] In addition, Payne's death sparked a number of conspiracy theories.[232]\n\nOn 25 October, all five One Direction albums reentered the top 40 of the UK Albums Chart at numbers 13 (Midnight Memories), 21 (Made in the A.M.), 22 (Four), 25 (Take Me Home), and 38 (Up All Night), with Payne's solo album LP1 re-entering at number 62.[233] In addition, the One Direction songs \"Night Changes\", \"Story of My Life\", and \"What Makes You Beautiful\" and Payne songs \"Strip That Down\", \"Get Low\", and \"Teardrops\" entered the UK singles chart at six, nine, 23, 41, 43, and 85, with \"Night Changes\" bettering its previous peak of 7 and \"Teardrops\" entering for the first time.[234]\n\nMedia coverage\n\nAmerican tabloid website TMZ obtained photographs of Payne's corpse and published cropped images that showed his arm and waist.[235][236] Their decision to publish the photos was criticised by a number of fans and public figures, prompting the outlet to remove the images.[237]\n\nABC News and Hulu produced an episode of Impact X Nightline about Payne's \"final days\", featuring contributions from X Factor contestant Mary Byrne and numerous ABC journalists before Payne's body had been buried, prompting criticism from a reviewer at The A.V.
