Yesterday, the Duchess of Cambridge arrived in Warsaw, Poland, along with her family for a multi-stop official royal tour. After touching down at the airport in a white Alexander McQueen ensemble, Middleton and Prince William were greeted by well-wishers en route to the Presidential Palace. (They were sans children, post-Prince George\u2019s less-than-happy arrival.)\n\nPoles greeted the duke and duchess with great enthusiasm, with many presenting the young royals with flowers or gifts. One such token-bearing person reportedly presented the duo with a gift fit for a newborn baby. Reacting in the moment, Middleton apparently joked to her husband, \u201cWe will just have to have more babies.\u201d\n\nUnsurprisingly, the world\u2019s joyous reaction was swift. All joking aside though, might the duke and duchess be planning on baby number three? While William is, of course, one of two, Kate grew up in a three-child household. And while the Duchess did experience serious medical issues during her previous pregnancies, they wouldn\u2019t be the first royals to have a large brood. After all, the Queen herself has four children. Perhaps that statement could be true again one day, albeit with a certain Queen Catherine formerly known as Kate Middleton. Only time will tell.", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6902341b8d2485587b8de59f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/691de52c1285351eba281434/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/691b9f96da942818c7375433/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/596e232f74b72106b2ef2957/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-tout-is-princess-kate-middleton-having-a-third-baby.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/691de779b647aca817f1d538/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/691c994f75750d1015c0079d/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68fdf8322ce499027c6c2a74/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6901466ee196acb44206cb62/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/us/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/596e2327784fb601f912d651/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/00-lede-is-princess-kate-middleton-having-a-third-baby.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/691c9de29a15d6c77521ecbc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6740fb4431390df05dc3a16a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/69165c072cfe3809fd23852e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6916192b6b64d990e3313359/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/691cb66d2578744d879b23d4/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/596e232f74b72106b2ef2957/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-tout-is-princess-kate-middleton-having-a-third-baby.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madeleine Luckel"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/kate-middleton-third-baby-comment-poland", "title": "Kate Middleton Jokes (We Think?)
