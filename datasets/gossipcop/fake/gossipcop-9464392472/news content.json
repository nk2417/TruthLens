AND IT\u2019S WORKING.\n\nAccording to OK Magazine, the two met in passing, and Jen thought he was \u201csort of cute.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo when Kris approached her about taking Rob out, Jen figured, \u2018Why not?'\u201d an insider said to the mag. \u201cAfter a few long phone calls and coffee dates and lunches, Jen is pleasantly surprised!\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MisterClasico/status/979440302804144129?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fbabe.net%2F2018%2F03%2F30%2Fjennifer-lawrence-and-rob-kardashian-have-been-going-on-dates-and-jennifer-was-weirdly-into-it-45755&tfw_creator=aribines&tfw_site=babedotnet\n\nNaturally, Rob is \u201ctotally smitten\u201d with Jen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always gone for the bad girls, so Jen is a complete breath of fresh air,\u201d the insider revealed.\n\nRob has been turning his life around recently, with a dramatic weight transformation and completely cutting Chyna out of his life so he can be a good dad to baby Dream. Maybe the best thing for him would be Jen?\n\nAs for her, she hasn\u2019t officially been with anybody since dating Darren Aronofsky.", "images":
