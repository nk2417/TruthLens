She told her she thought it was atrocious she and Harry were ruining Eugenie\u2019s wedding plans \u2013 that Harry should have known that Eugenie had always wanted to marry at St George\u2019s chapel,\u2019 says the insider.\n\nIt was confirmed last week that Eugenie has been forced to delay her wedding with the princess originally hoping to tie the knot in September, but settling for October.\n\nSt George\u2019s Chapel (Credit: Getty)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCamilla \u2013 who is reported to be jealous of Kate and Meghan\u2019s rising popularity \u2013 has also been causing tension among the royals, with sources saying that one of the scheming duchess\u2019 more brazen plots involved trying to convince Kate that Meghan was trying to steal some of her staff.\n\nAccording to insiders, it was Camilla who was behind the reassignment of Amy Pickerill from Kate and Wills\u2019 communications officer to Meghan\u2019s first royal assistant.\n\nAn insider tells, \u2018It shows that Camilla will stop at nothing to cause trouble between Kate and Meghan.\u2019\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea \u2013 out now!\n\nAdvertisement", "images":
