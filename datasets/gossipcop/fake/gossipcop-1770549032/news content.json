After watching her friend go through heartbreak from the ups and downs that occurred in her romance with Justin Bieber, Taylor is definitely not a Belieber. With the \u201cSorry\u201d singer aware that Swift dislikes him, Justin is blaming Taylor for the most recent crumbling of Jelena , according to Hollywood Life\u2019s insider.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t look for any signs on social media or in interviews that the Biebs blames Swift.\n\n\u201cJustin knows Taylor doesn\u2019t like him and never will and the feeling is mutual, but he is smart enough to know not to say anything in public or on social media because he knows all the scrutiny he\u2019d endure,\u201d explained the source.\n\nSwift recently attracted attention at the iHeartRadio Awards by throwing shade at the 22-year-old pop star after his performance, pointedly looking in the opposite direction. And the Biebs doesn\u2019t believe that he and Taylor will ever become pals. In contrast, he will always blame Swift for any problems in his Jelena relationship, claims the insider.\n\n\u201cHe never expects to be her friend and is not looking to be her friend. He blames Taylor for some of his issues with Selena and that will never go away.\u201d\n\nBut is Swift also to blame for any \u201cissues\u201d arising from the photos that circulated showing Gomez getting intimate with Orlando Bloom, who is Katy Perry\u2019s boyfriend? Amid the blame game controversy that resulted, sources told Naughty Gossip that Gomez was the one who was \u201c aggressive \u201d to hurt Katy.\n\n\u201cSelena really likes him and was very aggressive to get him,\u201d claimed one source. \u201cYou must remember that her best friend is Taylor Swift who hates Katy Perry. I can only imagine the things Taylor and Selena have said to each other about Katy.\u201d\n\nAs to whether Swift actually orchestrated the hookup to make Perry feel bad, however?\n\n\u201cI doubt Taylor was behind this hookup, but you know these two have spoken about it since,\u201d added the insider.\n\nTaking it one step further, Wendy Williams used her talk show as a platform to claim that Swift pushed her pal to get intimate with Orlando, an allegation that Gossip Cop calls false.\n\n\u201cSelena is best friends with Taylor Swift. And Taylor is [a] low-key mean girl, doesn\u2019t want to see anybody get anything,\u201d slammed Wendy. \u201cKaty, you need to be looking at your man\u2026sicced on him by Taylor Swift. Taylor is just a [b***h].\u201d\n\nHowever, when it comes to Swift and the allegations of cheating, Taylor was never involved, according to Gossip Cop .\n\nAs for how Katy feels about this situation? Perry is dealing with it by turning to Twitter to challenge all those allegations, pointed out Vanity Fair .\n\nIs that all there is? https://t.co/54Q72MfXND \u2014 KATY PERRY (@katyperry) May 12, 2016\n\nUsing social media to showcase her views, Katy tweeted a link to Peggy Lee\u2019s song, \u201cIs That All There Is?\u201d and followed it with a link to an article about Bloom\u2019s efforts as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador in Eastern Ukraine.\n\n\u201cInstead of giving energy & eyeballs to dumb conspiracy, check out how cool this is,\u201d urged Perry. \u201c#dontfeedthebeast.\u201d\n\nInstead of giving energy & eyeballs to dumb conspiracy ? check out how C??L this is: https://t.co/ClmGlPMz3x #dontfeedthebeast \u2014 KATY PERRY (@katyperry) May 12, 2016\n\nProviding her own view on the situation, Gomez retweeted what Katy had posted, complete with a prayer hands emoji.\n\nJust one week after all the scandal erupted over the photos showing Selena and Orlando getting cozy, Perry was seen cuddling and kissing her boyfriend on what the Daily Mail describes as a \u201cromantic rendezvous in Cannes.\u201d\n\nKaty has been dating her actor boyfriend for four months, and their canoodling on a yacht at the French Riviera resort Sunday seemed to discount all those cheating rumors. Perry, 31, is in Cannes to perform at the amfAR Cinema Against AIDs benefit.\n\n[Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images]", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2421769f-57a4-4bff-913f-cf316747493e.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20424%20594'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20157'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20492%20142'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo-white.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b080b69e05111d2a8b3b6633f72f8c45?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20388%20594'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20432%20594'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Selena-Taylor-Swift.jpg", "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Katy-Perry-And-Selena.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inquisitr-logo.png", "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Selena-Justin-Split.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent-Dark-Mode.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20120%20120'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/justin-bieber-blames-taylor-swift-for-selena-gomez-split-swift-orchestrated-orlando-bloom-drama-to-hurt-katy-perry", "title": "Justin Bieber Blames Taylor Swift For Selena Gomez Split: Swift Orchestrated Orlando Bloom Drama To Hurt Katy Perry?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.png", "description": "Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez have remained friends for years despite the media spotlight that causes some celebrity relationships to splinter.
