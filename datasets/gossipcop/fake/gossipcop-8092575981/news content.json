We\u2019re back with another week of Becca Kufrin\u2018s season of The Bachelorette \u2014 read on for everything that goes down.\n\nHOMETOWN DATE WITH GARRETT\n\nFor her first date of the week, Becca travels to Garrett\u2019s family\u2019s home-base in Manteca, California. They own an agricultural business, so Becca and Garrett spend the day planting tomatoes \u2014 and, of course, a rose bush. It\u2019s all very wholesome and sweet, and Becca reiterates how much Garrett \u2014 a real \u201csalt of the earth\u201d kind of guy \u2014 reminds her of her late father.\n\nBecca is wary that Garrett\u2019s family is going to be extra guarded considering his recent failed marriage. It\u2019s important to her that they realize that she\u2019s \u201cnothing like his ex,\u201d and it appears she succeeds. By the end of the evening, Becca has won over the whole family and they happily \u2014 albeit cautiously \u2014 give Garrett their blessing to pursue a future with her.\n\n\u201cGarrett\u2019s family is so kind,\u201d she reflects afterwards. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much heart and love behind all of them, and that\u2019s something that I want in my future partner\u2019s family \u2014 and in my future family. I could see myself fitting in with his family for life and starting a family of our own, and that\u2019s something really special and meaningful. Something just feels so easy and right and natural with him. It just feels like it\u2019s all falling into place.\u201d\n\nHOMETOWN DATE WITH JASON\n\nNext up is Jason\u2019s hometown date in Buffalo, New York. After hitting up a wing-eating competition and spending some time at a hockey rink, they arrive at Jason\u2019s family home, where Becca meets his parents, his brother and his brother-in-law.\n\nJason reveals to his family that even though his heart is generally \u201cpretty darn guarded,\u201d he\u2019s falling for Becca \u201creally deeply, really seriously \u2014 like I\u2019ve never fell for anyone before.\u201d For her part, Becca admits that there\u2019s \u201cstill a long way to go,\u201d but she\u2019s \u201chopeful\u201d about their future.\n\nBefore they part ways that night, Jason decides the time has come to finally express his feelings.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m with you, I can\u2019t stop smiling, and when I go to bed, I can\u2019t stop thinking about you,\u201d he tells her. \u201cWhen I wake up, I want to be with you. When I kiss you, I don\u2019t want to stop kissing you. All that does is tell me one thing. It tells me that I\u2019m so insanely, wildly in love with you and I can say it with more confidence than I\u2019ve ever been able to say anything.\u201d\n\nHOMETOWN DATE WITH BLAKE\n\nBlake\u2019s hometown date kicks off at Platte Canyon High, his local high school in Bailey, Colorado. As we already know, high school was a huge part of Blake\u2019s life \u2014 it\u2019s where he found out that his mom, who worked at the school, was having an affair with one of his teachers. But as he reveals on the date, those four years were made even more impactful when they were struck by true tragedy: His senior year, the school was victimized by a shooting in which one student lost her life.\n\nBlake opens up about the experience because he wants Becca to know how deeply it changed his outlook, encouraging him to see \u201clife as a gift.\u201d After the emotional revelation, he surprises Becca with a Betty Who concert in the school auditorium before bringing her home to meet his family. Right from the get-go, they can tell that he\u2019s head-over-heels for her.\n\n\u201cI absolutely believe Blake is in love,\u201d says his mom, Shelly. \u201cHe\u2019s got that look in his eye that makes me think he has found the one that he wants to spend the rest of his life with. But my biggest fear is that Blake\u2019s heart could be broken again.\u201d\n\nSitting down with Becca, Shelly asks if she feels ready to be engaged again, a mere six months after the Arie breakup. Becca says she\u2019s ready to jump back in \u201cwith the right person\u201d \u2014 and says Blake is the one that makes her feel so hopeful again.\n\n\u201cAfter talking with Blake\u2019s family, I feel like I know him so much more,\u201d Becca reflects afterwards. \u201cIt makes my feelings grow even stronger for him. \u2026 I can see Blake in my life forever, and his family in my life forever.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: The Bachelorette\u2018s Blake Opens Up About Surviving School Shooting \u2014 Bachelor Nation Reacts\n\nHOMETOWN DATE WITH COLTON\n\nFor the final hometown date, Becca heads to Parker, Colorado. Colton, who founded a non-profit that benefits cystic fibrosis, takes her to the Children\u2019s Hospital to surprise some of the kids with presents and toys.\n\nThat night, she meets his family. One of the big questions Colton\u2019s dad has is about the whole Tia situation. As previously revealed, Colton had a short-lived relationship in January with Tia Booth, who competed on The Bachelor alongside Becca. Though Becca wasn\u2019t quite sure how to take the news at first \u2014 especially considering the fact that she and Tia are actually good friends \u2014 Tia made an appearance on a recent episode and gave Becca her blessing to keep dating Colton.\n\nColton reassures his dad that he\u2019s been totally honest with Becca about the situation and they\u2019ve moved past it, a sentiment echoed by Becca herself. But his dad isn\u2019t done with the tough line of questioning, and when he sits down one-on-one with Becca, he point-blank asks her not to pick his son unless he\u2019s truly the one. \u201cIt\u2019s better to have someone hurt now than down the road, if it\u2019s the wrong decision,\u201d he warns her.\n\nBecca, meanwhile, is concerned that Colton \u2014 who\u2019s a virgin \u2014 may not have enough relationship experience to know what he wants. But before they part ways that night, he makes sure to tell her exactly how he\u2019s feeling.\n\n\u201cWhen Colton tells me he loves me, it makes me feel so special,\u201d she says afterwards. \u201cEverything that I\u2019ve seen in Colton, just in his actions, I could see a husband, a life partner, a teammate. I\u2019m falling for him.\u201d\n\nROSE CEREMONY\n\nOf course, things could only go so smoothly for so long. After the four hometowns, Becca flies back to Los Angeles to gear up for the rose ceremony. But before she makes her final decision, she\u2019s visited by a few of her fellow Bachelor alums to catch them up on where everything stands so far. A visibly uncomfortable Tia asks to pull her aside.\n\n\u201cObviously this is hard for me and I\u2019m nervous to even have to talk to you about this right now,\u201d she begins. \u201cBut I just had to be fully honest and put it out there because it\u2019s been weighing on me. I feel like I\u2019m so excited to hear you talk about Blake and Garrett and Jason \u2014 and when I think about Colton, if I\u2019m being completely honest with myself, I do feel like I still have feelings for him. When I think about Colton being at this point, now, it makes me sick to my stomach \u2014 knowing that you got to meet his family and knowing that he\u2019s still here in this makes me sick.\u201d\n\nBecca is understandably surprised \u2014 \u201cI did think that we put that behind us,\u201d she says \u2014 and irritated.\n\n\u201cI thought we put it to bed weeks ago,\u201d she says after Tia leaves. \u201cI thought it was done, so the fact that she does still have some feelings and isn\u2019t on board with me being with Colton makes me frustrated. It makes me angry. It hurts to hear. I don\u2019t want to lose any friendship over a guy, but the last time I saw Colton it was a wonderful night with his family and he told me that he loves me. So now, I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\n\nAfter giving it some thought, Becca declares that her conversation with Tia \u201cdoesn\u2019t change anything\u201d and vows to keep trusting her gut and following her heart.\n\n\u201cI knew coming into tonight that this rose ceremony was going to be the hardest because I am falling for all of these guys,\u201d she says. \u201cI know I\u2019m making the right choice, but it\u2019s going to be difficult because it\u2019s not fair to this person who I\u2019m about to blindside. I feel terrible.\u201d\n\nThe men arrive, and Becca hands out her final three roses: one for Blake, one for Jason, and one for Garrett. She walks Colton out with a heavy heart, admitting that she feels like a \u201cterrible person.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m shocked,\u201d says Colton. \u201cI\u2019m confused. I just didn\u2019t see tonight going like that, at all. I\u2019m trying to figure out why, because my hometown date was hands down one of the best days. I fell in love Becca \u2014 and it\u2019s just hard when you don\u2019t get loved back.\u201d\n\nThe Bachelorette airs Mondays (8 p.m. ET) on ABC.", "images":
