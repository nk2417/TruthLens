(Image: Rex)\n\nThere are probably quite a lot of things that Kristen Stewart would like to undo after pictures showed her cheating on Robert Pattinson with a married film director.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nBut unfortunately for Kristen, life doesn\u2019t have the ctrl+z option so she\u2019s stuck with any mistakes she (might) have made \u2013 and embarrassing things she might have said.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nJust one month before she was exposed as a cheat with Rupert Sanders, she revealed that she wants to have babies with her long-term boyfriend R-Pattz.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nIn an un-guarded moment, she told Vogue journalist Christa D\u2019Souza: \"My God, I'm so in love with my boyfriend. I wish he were here now. I think I want to have his babies.\"\n\nBefore adding: \u201cI love the way he smells. And him me. Like, he loves to lick under my armpits.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s ultimately quite a gross thing to say, it proves that Rob found Kristen so amazing he was happy to lick her sweaty pits. But he\u2019s not the only person to think his Twilight co-star is, er, flawless.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nRupert describes Kristen, 22, as \"amazing\" and \"flawless\" in the voiceover on the Snow White and the Huntsman DVD director's commentary.\n\nIt\u2019s a fair assumption this was filmed before his fling with K-Stew became world (and wife Liberty Ross) knowledge.\n\nView 4 Images (Image: Getty)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nBefore the affair, Rupert was asked whether Kristen and Liberty \u2013 who also featured in the movie \u2013 were friends.\n\nView 4 Images No worries? The t-shirt means 'to be at total peace with yourself'\n\nYesterday, Kristen wore Rob's t-shirt which had the word IRIE printed on the front when she arrived in Toronto for the film festival.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nAnd if you didn't know what that means, it stands for \u2018the way you feel when you have no worries \u2013 to be at total peace with your current state of being\u2019.\n\nWe feel a bit like Sherlock Holmes piecing together the hidden flirty messages.\n\nView 4 Images October issue of British Vogue/photographer Mario Testino (Image: October issue of British Vogue/photographer Mario Testino)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nTake a look at our amazing timeline which logs everything from Kristen and Rob\u2019s first kiss to the latest pictures from the love scandal \u2013 here .\n\nWhile Rob is at the VMAs with the Twilight cast, Kristen is alone on the red carpet in Canada.
