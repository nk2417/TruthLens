Now they\u2019re bonding over being pregnant together.\u2019\n\nDespite the two wanting to share the exciting news with the world, In Touch\u2019s bombshell report reveals the two women have only disclosed to friends and family.\n\nRelated: Kate Middleton and Prince William expecting fourth child\n\nRelated: Meghan and Harry\u2019s twin joy\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\nOn top of the exciting news, Meghan feels an \u2018enormous relief.\u2019\n\n\u2018She was a nervous wreck about conceiving,\u2019 a palace insider says, not only because of her age but \u2018because it didn\u2019t happen with her first husband,\u2019 producer Trevor Engelson, from whom she split in 2013 after two years of marriage and nine years as a couple.\n\nThe pressure to give husband, Prince Harry, children \u2018felt like a huge weight on Meghan\u2019s shoulders,\u2019 says the source.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Everyone expected her to get pregnant immediately.\u2019\n\nMeanwhile Prince William, 36, was \u2018initially shocked when Kate told him he\u2019s going to be a dad again\u2019, but now he sees it as a \u2018happy surprise.\u2019\n\n\u2018He and Kate have always wanted four kids,\u2019 the source tells.\n\nAnd this time around, adds the source, Kate gets to share her pregnancy journey with not only her young sister Pippa, 34, who is due with her first child in a few months, but her new sister-in-law, too.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\nThe source adds that Kate is \u2018convinced she\u2019s having another girl because she\u2019s having the same cravings for sweets that she did when she was pregnant with Charlotte.\u2019\n\nMeghan is hoping for one of each \u2013 a boy and a girl \u2013 the insider tells In Touch.\n\n\u2018This is a dream come true for both couples.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe royal family is yet to respond to In Touch\u2019s report.", "images":
