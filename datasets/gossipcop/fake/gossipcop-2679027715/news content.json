I think it\u2019s actually like, I think it\u2019s time. There are bigger fish to fry, and there are real problems in the world. You know what I\u2019m saying? \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of other things out there in the world that people need to be focused on, and I truly, like God bless her on her journey. God bless her. Honestly.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Swift seemed to make a not-so-subtle point when she announced the release of her entire back catalog on all streaming services \u2013 just as Perry dropped her fourth studio album, Witness.\n\nPerry and Swift\u2019s fallout dates back to 2014, when Swift suggested in a Rolling Stone interview that Perry had once stolen backup dancers out from under her, effectively throwing a wrench in their friendship.\n\nTrending Stories 2025 CMA Awards: The Complete Winners List Stephen Wilson Jr. Mesmerizes the 2025 CMA Awards With 'Stand by Me' Is This Mysterious U.K. Rapper Actually Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet?
