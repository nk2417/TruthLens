As part of their visit, Shiloh reportedly participated in a tradition that the media outlet described as heartbreaking for her dad. The 11-year-old allegedly was seen with a lock that she had marked up with the initials of her closest relatives with the exception of her famous father, Brad.\n\nPitt\u2019s first biological child then fastened the lock onto a bridge that overlooks the River Seine. Shiloh reportedly took the key for that lock and tossed it into the water.\n\nRadar Online pointed out that the photos obtained by the publication seemed \u201cinnocent\u201d at first. Later, however, after seeing that Brad\u2019s initials were allegedly missing from the lock, the media outlet questioned Pitt\u2019s relationship with his kids.\n\n\u201cShocking new photos exclusively obtained by Radar Online of [Brad Pitt\u2019s] estranged wife, Angelina Jolie, vacationing with their six kids in Paris appeared innocent but later proved to be every father\u2019s worst nightmare!\u201d\n\nAsked about the reason why Shiloh would put all the family members\u2019 initials on a lock, fasten it to the bridge, and then throw away the key, a source told Radar Online that it is a \u201cFrench tradition.\u201d Visitors to the bridge from other countries, as well as Paris residents, take time to write down their names with a date on padlocks. As for why Shiloh allegedly tossed the key into the water, the source explained that the gesture symbolizes that every person named on the lock is locked in love forever.\n\nShiloh Jolie-Pitt\u2019s Gesture Has Shocking Interpretation By Insider\n\nBut Brad reportedly was the only family member left out when Shiloh wrote down the names of her closest relatives, according to Radar . A source described as someone close to Angelina Jolie\u2019s and Pitt\u2019s family offered a shocking interpretation of what the lock scenario means.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if Shiloh was disowning her dad!\u201d\n\nWhile Jolie frequently has been seen on the red carpet and shopping with one or more of her children, Brad reportedly sees the kids behind closed doors, according to the media outlet.
