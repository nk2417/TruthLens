The Oscar-winning actress is subtly addressed on the first track of JAY-Z\u2018s highly anticipated new album 4:44, which was released on June 30. In one of his epic rhymes, Hov calls out Halle\u2019s ex husband Eric Ben\u00e9t, 50, for screwing up a good thing and surprisingly, she was all for it. \u201cHalle absolutely loves JAY\u2019s track and thinks it\u2019s hilarious he cracked on Eric about his cheating,\u201d a source close to the starlet tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cJAY is totally right Eric\u2019s cheating did ruin their marriage and it really hurt Halle.\u201d\n\nHalley and Eric called it quits in 2005, shortly after he was caught cheating. The R&B star reportedly confessed to having hooked up with several other women while married to Halle. Eric later married Manuela Testolini in 2011, however JAY is now shining a new light on his past indiscretions. \u201cYou almost went Eric Ben\u00e9t / Let the baddest girl in the world get away / I don\u2019t even know what else to say,\u201d he raps in his opening track titled \u201cKill JAY-Z.\u201d\n\nTaking to Twitter on June 30, Eric clapped back at the rapper in a major way. \u201cHey yo #Jayz! Just so ya know, I got the baddest girl in the world as my wife\u2026.like right now,\u201d he wrote. Even though Halle has moved on and is looking happier than ever these days, she\u2019s not ticked that Eric was called out for his wrongdoings. \u201cHalle isn\u2019t one to forget people who screw her over too easily or quickly so it definitely gave her a giggle,\u201d our insider continued. \u201cEric\u2019s snarky response just shows how lucky Halle is to have moved on.\u201d\n\nHova totally called out Eric, but he wasn\u2019t afraid of picking on himself as well. JAY talked about \u201cBecky,\u201d his relationship struggles with Beyonce and hunger to stay in the rap game throughout his epic 10-feature album 4:44. Music is all about expression and the rapper definitely got a lot off his chest!\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think of JAY\u2019s new album?
