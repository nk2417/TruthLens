Why Trust Us?\n\n9 min read\n\nBack in 2021, Kate Hudson , now 44, and her fianc\u00e9, Danny Fujikawa, now 37, got engaged after 15 years of being friends, and four years of dating, per People . And while they haven't tied the knot just yet, they definitely seem to be enjoying a pretty blissful life together.\n\nThe couple welcomed a daughter together in 2018, Rani Rose, and after her arrival, Danny expressed his admiration for Kate in the sweetest way. \u201cI\u2019ve seen her do things that I can\u2019t imagine doing myself and I\u2019m very proud of her,\u201d he told Entertainment Tonight.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m in awe of her for some of the things that she is able to do when she sets her mind to it,\u201d he added.\n\nLucky for Kate, Danny makes her busy life brighter, even when they\u2019re not on the best terms. \"He makes me feel beautiful every single moment of the day, even when we have fought,\" she said in a People cover story. \"I still feel loved. His devotion to the family unit makes me feel safe and confident and secure.\"\n\nDuring an interview on comedian Chelsea Handler\u2019s podcast, Kate explained that her relationship with Danny is \u201cthe best,\u201d and that it\u2019s \u201cthe first relationship I\u2019ve had where I really feel free.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe gives me so much freedom\u2026when you have someone who has such a deep trust in you and gives you so much freedom, it feels so nice,\u201d she told Chelsea.\n\nKate, who has two sons from a previous relationship, in addition to her daughter with Danny, explained that they don\u2019t have a \"traditional setup\" family- or relationship-wise. \"And I have to say, I have zero regrets of my life. I\u2019ve never defined myself through the way that a man sees me. But I can define myself in the unit that we can create together,\" she explained.\n\nA partnership like this doesn't happen by accident, though. Kate and Danny have a long, adorable history. Here's everything you need to know about Kate's longtime friend, fianc\u00e9, and baby daddy, Danny Fujikawa.\n\nThey made their red carpet debut as a couple in May 2017.\n\nIt was at the premiere of Snatched in LA, where Kate and Danny first kissed and posed for photos together on a red carpet. \u201cMy cute man. He\u2019s the best!\u201d she told Extra at the premiere.\n\nAnd, when asked what she loves most about him, Kate said, \u201cHow long do you have? He\u2019s a good man.\u201d But rumors about their relationship started popping up in March of the same year, since the couple was spotted kissing during a lunch date in Los Angeles, according to People.\n\nThey knew each other for years before they started dating.\n\nKate said in an Instagram post in December 2017 that she first met Danny when she was 23 and pregnant with her son, Ryder. Danny's stepsisters are Kate\u2019s best friends, she says, so they\u2019ve been in the same circles for years.\n\n\u201cA year ago today Danny took me on a hike and what I thought was just a hike with a family friend turned very quickly into an unexpected first date,\u201d Kate wrote in her Instagram caption. \u201cNo moves were made on this first date. In fact, it took months for him to make a first move! And as a kiss on this bridge would have been nice, the kiss a year later was so much sweeter. So on our 15th year of knowing each other we were able to open our hearts to each other to feel so much pure love and it\u2019s been truly incredible!\"\n\n\n\nHe's a total family man.\n\nKate has two children, Ryder Russell Robinson, 17, and Bingham Hawn Bellamy, 10, from previous relationships with Chris Robinson and Matt Bellamy, respectively. She also has a daughter, 2, with Danny. Kate and Danny have found a way to make blended family life work for them.\n\n\u201cIf I have to go to a dinner meeting, he can be home,\u201d Kate told WH. \u201cHis number one priority is family. And when we have our disputes, I feel the thing that allows us to get through them is having the same ultimate goal, and that includes being in each other\u2019s life. It just feels so nice.\u201d\n\nDanny is Kate's support system.\n\nKate Hudson is an absolute powerhouse (see: her interview in the Women's Health December 2019 issue for proof). She's an actress, business mogul, and mom of three who still manages to find time for self-care and three to four workouts a week (including pole dancing!). But her crazy schedule wouldn't be nearly as manageable without a little help from her fianc\u00e9.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the best man,\u201d Kate previously told Women's Health. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I feel like I have a real teammate in this. We\u2019re able to pick up where the other one has to leave off.\u201d\n\nThey welcomed their first child together in October 2018.\n\nThe actress posted a simple Instagram photo that reads: \"10-2-18\" on top of a pink background. \"She\u2019s here \ud83d\udc95,\" Kate shared in the caption.\n\n\n\nKate also wrote that she and Danny decided to name their daughter Rani Rose Hudson Fujikawa. It's their first baby together, btw!\n\n\u201cWe have decided to name our daughter Rani (pronounced Ronnie) after her grandfather, Ron Fujikawa. Ron was the most special man who we all miss dearly. To name her after him is an honor,\u201d Kate wrote in her announcement post.\n\nShe added: \u201cEveryone is doing well and happy as can be. Our family thanks you for all the love and blessings that have been sent our way and we send ours right back.\u201d\n\nThey were very excited for Rani's arrival.\n\nKate told People that she \"[looks] forward to having feminine energy\" around.\n\nAnd her brothers Oliver Hudson and Wyatt Russell confirmed both she and Danny were very excited about their daughter on the way.\n\n\u201cI was teary-eyed because I know how badly she wanted a girl,\u201d he told People in April. \u201cI know Danny, I\u2019m sure in some part of every man\u2019s brain you\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019d love to have a little me.\u2019\u201d\n\nWyatt added: \u201cBut when he met my brother\u2019s little girl Rio, who\u2019s the cutest thing in the entire world, she made him be like, \u2018Okay, I want a girl.\u2019 So they\u2019re really excited.\u201d\n\nBoth Danny and Kate went into full-blown nesting mode.\n\nIn Kate's Instagram story at the end of September 2018, Kate posted a series of photos that revealed she and Danny were prepping their baby's nursery as they eagerly awaited her arrival.\n\nThe story pics included a poll about wallpaper, a photo of the bassinet they chose for the room, and finally a photo of Danny wearing a baby carrier with the caption \"I think someone's ready to go!\"\n\nThey announced Kate's pregnancy in the cutest (and realest) way.\n\nKate and her honey first announced they were expecting a baby girl together back in April 2018 with an Instagram video. The post showed the couple\u2014along with Kate's sons Ryder and Bingham\u2014popping four huge balloons that contained pink confetti. (Cue everyone screaming.)\n\n\u201cSURPRISE!!! If you\u2019ve wondered why I\u2019ve been so absent on my social channels it\u2019s because I have never been more sick!\u201d Kate wrote in the caption. \u201c[It] was the most sick first trimester of all my children. Boomerangs have made me nauseous, Superzoom is an easy way to have my head in the toilet, food Instagrams make me [queasy] and thinking too much about Insta stories made me even more exhausted than I already had been.\u201d\n\nDanny fits in perfectly with Kate's family.\n\nFollowing the actress's birthday in 2018, Kate posted this cute pic with Danny, along with the caption: \"#tbt To my favorite birthday moment. You can\u2019t really see my kiddos in the front but I was getting love from all my boys at once. #FeelingLucky.\"\n\nDanny is a musician.\n\nKate\u2019s former husband Chris Robinson and ex Matt Bellamy were also in the music biz. Danny is the former singer and guitarist for the band Chief.\n\nHe also owns the record label Lightwave Records, which he started in 2013 with The Delta Mirror frontman Chris Acosta, according to the label\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\n\nHe worked on Kate's promo videos for her clothing line.\n\nDanny can officially add professional Instagram/social media boyfriend to his resume. In a recent post, he shared a video for Kate's clothing line Happy x Nature, that he not only edited but composed the music for too!\n\nHe captioned the video, \"Here lies the teaser I edited and musically composed for my baby\u2019s new \u201cready-to-wear\u201d clothing line. Of all the clothes in the world that are ready to wear, these are the most ready. #happyxnature #THX\"\n\nAnd of course, Kate looks amazing.\n\nHe clearly has a great sense of humor.\n\nKate's boo seems like a pretty hilarious guy. He regularly posts pics on Instagram of himself doing funny things like posing in a sheet mask and \u201ccrying\u201d after he shaved off his long beard.\n\nThey've traveled the world together.\n\nIt's clear from their Instagrams that these two love to travel and share experiences together. The couple has sailed in Cambodia, hit the skii slopes for Valentine\u2019s Day and even went to Dubai, where Kate and Danny gave falconry a try.\n\nWhile Kate was six months pregnant with Rani, the couple took a \"babymoon\" trip and traveled through Italy, with friends and family.\n\nThe crew conquered Sicily in July, and Kate posted these cute candid pictures from their trip:\n\n\u201c\ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf9\u2764\ufe0f\u2600\ufe0f#sicily,\u201dshe wrote in the caption.\n\n\n\nNo doubt about it\u2014they're a jet-setting fam.\n\nThey workout together, too.\n\nKate's a big fitness fan, and Danny works out right by her side. It's unclear if he joins for all her sweat sessions, but he shared one hilarious gym video on Instagram.\n\nKate's open to having more kids with Danny.\n\nThe actress chatted about having another baby with Danny on The Ellen Degeneres Show in February of 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m done. I\u2019m in that place of like, right now, Rani is at that age where you\u2019re like, \u2018I want another baby.\u2019 But once she gets like 4 or 5, you\u2019re like, \u2018I feel like my life is kinda back a little bit [and] they\u2019re kinda in a groove,\u2019\u201d she told Ellen. \u201cIt\u2019s weird\u2026 it\u2019s like a window.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not rushing the wedding planning.\n\nWhen the couple first got engaged back in 2021, the thought of planning a wedding was \u201clike, a lot. It\u2019s a lot,\u201d Kate told ET .\n\nIn September 2022, just a year after their engagement, Kate still had \u201cno idea\u201d when the two were going to say \u201cI do.\u201d \u201cWe can\u2019t wait but no, not yet,\u201d per US Weekly .\n\nIn November 2022, Kate shared that they were still in no rush to walk down the aisle. As far as wedding planning, she said they were just in the \u201cpre-planning\u201d stage. \u201cI mean, I love that man. He\u2019s right over there, hiding, but the last thing we\u2019re doing right now during the holidays is planning anything but the holidays,\u201dshe told ET.\n\nKate offered up another wedding update in February 2023. \u201cRight now, planning a wedding feels insane, but I\u2019m excited to plan a wedding, and I go back and forth between a small wedding and a large wedding,\u201d she shared on the Table for Two podcast .\n\nBecause her wedding to her ex-husband Chris Robinson was small, she wanted her wedding to Danny to be \u201cthe big bash.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s like two sides to me: the big bash or the small, intimate wedding,\u201d she told Bruce Bozzi, the Table for Two podcast host.\n\nKate celebrated Danny\u2019s birthday with a sweet post.\n\nOn June 10 Kate celebrated her fianc\u00e9\u2019s 37th birthday by posting adorable pictures accompanied by the sweetest message on Instagram.\n\n\u201cThe most loving, pure, honest, sensitive, brilliant, caring man is 37 today! Happiest Birthday to my love, my partner, my man! I\u2019m so grateful we shacked up together, had a baby and decided to be married\u2026when we have time to plan it \ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udd70People wonder what makes love last\u2026I wonder too! I think there\u2019s a lot of factors but this last slide has to definitely be one. Find someone to get weird with and no, this will not be the direction of my album, this is just what happens in our house when there\u2019s day drinking involved\u2026.\ud83d\ude06 I love you madly @fujikawadanny HAPPY BIRTHDAY \ud83c\udf89,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s so hard not to adore this power couple!", "images":
