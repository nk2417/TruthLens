Now she thinks she\u2019s be a totally different parent.\u201d\n\n\n\nHowever, the Kardashian-Jenner clan are said to be horrified that 68-year-old Cait is considering giving motherhood a go \u2013 especially Kim.\n\n\n\n\u201cKim was furious when Caitlyn reached out to her surrogate,\u201d continues Star\u2018s insider.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like there aren\u2019t any other surrogates in the world. Kim is convinced that this is just a way of pushing her buttons, and clearly Caitlyn is just as petty as ever.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the mean time, Caitlyn at least has her new granddaughter to keep her occupied.\n\n\n\nFollowing the news earlier this week that Kylie Jenner, 20 had given birth to a baby girl, Caitlyn congratulated her daughter with a sweet post on Instagram.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy daughter just had a daughter. It\u2019s amazing to be by your side through this journey. She\u2019s SO beautiful already. Can\u2019t wait to watch her grow. Throwback to my baby, as a baby @kyliejenner,\u201d she wrote.\n\nCaitlyn has yet to respond to Star\u2019s report.\n\nAdvertisement", "images":
