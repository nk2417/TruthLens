She loves being able to do her own thing and to only have to report to herself.\u2019\n\nBut is she ready jump back into the dating pool?\n\n\u2018Love is taking a back seat as she is much more interested in her work and just living life. She doesn\u2019t have any eyes for a man right now and is taking her newly available time for herself,\u2019 the source concluded.\n\nThat\u2019s right Jen \u2013 you don\u2019t need a man to live your life to the fullest.\n\nBoth actors have not yet spoken out about their split since releasing a joint statement in February that read: \u2018In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation.\n\nThis decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\u2019\n\nThese reports come after it was said that Justin has reportedly started dating the artist and photographer Petra Collins.\n\nJustin is said to be dating artist Petra Colins (Picture: Getty)\n\nStar magazine has claimed the actor and screenwriter is \u2018obsessed\u2019 with the Canadian and has been \u2018enjoying cosy dinner dates\u2019 with the 25-year-old, who\u2019s a regular on the glittering social circuit.\n\nA source told the publication: \u2018Justin and Petra have been carrying on for some time. He insists that they\u2019re just \u201cfriends\u201d but he seems obsessed with her, and Jen isn\u2019t buying it.\u2019\n\nAccording to the source the two met on the \u2018New York arts scene and hit it off right away\u2019.\n\nThen last month, the actor tagged Petra in one of his Instagram shots shortly before he and Jen released a statement proclaiming their separation after three years of marriage.\n\nThe two of them \u2013 headless, weirdly \u2013 posed next to each other in T-shirts by designer pal Adam Selman \u2013 which has now been taken over by comments and speculation by followers and fans.\n\nMetro.co.uk contacted reps for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
