Simpson would be the only other person who could perhaps take this credit \u2014 after all, he put Robert Kardashian on his legal team for his murder trial, which was the very first time the public heard the Kardashian name.\n\nThat little tie-in probably had a little to do with our fascination with the family once the reality show started, but actually getting the show picked up?\n\nThat was all Kim (shout-out to Ray J though).\n\nIf she hadn\u2019t buddied up with Paris Hilton and had that whole sex tape leak, there\u2019s a solid chance we wouldn\u2019t know who any of these people are, so it\u2019s understandable that she takes credit for it all.\n\nBut the source also says that Kim \"always thought she\u2019d be the first billionaire in the family.\"\n\nThen Kylie happened.\n\nWith her wildly successful cosmetics company and her popularity with the younger crowd, Kylie could very easily be the first billionaire in the family.\n\nKylie Cosmetics is actually all set to become a billion dollar company within the next few years.\n\nAnd now Kim is apparently \"desperate to dethrone Kylie.\"\n\nIt seems like the makeup thing is a particularly sore spot for Kim \u2014 the insider says that \"Kylie\u2019s makeup empire has amassed her a fortune and Kim is a little bitter about all the money that goes straight into Kylie\u2019s pockets.\"\n\nAgain, \"because Kim feels like much of those earnings are thanks to everything she did first.\"\n\nIf this is true, it\u2019s such a petty stance, because then wouldn\u2019t Kim owe Paris for helping her to become famous? And wouldn\u2019t Paris owe her super wealthy family for putting her in the position to become famous?\n\nWhere does it end?\n\nWhether you like her or not, Kylie\u2019s makeup company is successful for a reason.\n\nShe has quality products, she\u2019s put the work in, and she wisely capitalized on her popularity and all the attention she and her lips have been getting for years now.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t owe Kim anything for that.\n\nYou might think it\u2019s a little sad that Kim is anything but happy for her little sister\u2019s success, but don\u2019t worry \u2014 Kylie is in on it, too.\n\nThe source claims that the littlest Jenner has \"become increasingly worried that Kim is going to steal back her thunder, but she\u2019s ready to take her on.\"\n\n\"She loves being a mom but there\u2019s no way in hell she\u2019s going to let Kim win the money game.\"\n\nYep, step aside, little Stormi, mama\u2019s got even more money to make!\n\nAnd speaking of Stormi \u2026 is anyone looking forward to 2040 when we\u2019ll be reading stories like these about her and North?!\n\nIt\u2019s the circle of life. Look into it, Kim.", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/2552_D085_00216R-H-2025-80x80.webp", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1154615733-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2159895990-6-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247300883-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_annaduggar_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1119_janellebrown_angelamoody_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/molly-and-luis-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/69023040a27d084abe99b818-80x80.webp", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/kim-kardashian-is-weirded-out-679x1024.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1119_tekashi6ix9ine_header-80x80.jpg", "http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kim-kardashian-west-snapshot-783x1024.png"], "top_img": "http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kim-kardashian-west-snapshot-783x1024.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Trainham"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/03/kim-kardashian-desperate-to-take-down-kylie-jenner/", "title": "Kim Kardashian: Desperate to Take Down Kylie Jenner?!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian: Desperate to Take Down Kylie Jenner?!", "description": "Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner: sisters, friends, reality show co-stars ... ...
