This is best described as a professional friendship.\u2019\n\n\u201cTheir friendship has not turned into romance \u2026 as both are cautious and this is, again, more of a professional friendship, but Brad is very interested in spending more time with Neri, she is fascinating.\u201d\n\nNeri was previously married to Grammy Award-winning composer Osvaldo Golijov. Her work has been exhibited around the world and she has given numerous talks on the marriage of design, technology and biology.\n\nEarlier this month The Sun exclusively revealed Brad and Angelina have called a truce and will settle their previously bitter divorce within weeks.\n\nAngelina, 42, has now agreed to give Brad access to their six children.\n\nLawyers for Hollywood\u2019s former star couple are putting the finishing touches on the agreement.\n\nIt is expected to be filed imminently after they received court approval to continue negotiating in February.\n\nThe amicable formal end to the marriage is in stark contrast to the public warfare after their break-up.\n\nA source close to Angelina revealed: \u201cThe terms of the divorce are now agreed.\n\n\u201cThey are being finalised by both legal teams, but will be filed within weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge turnaround from where the marriage ended, especially given the claims Angelina made against Brad, but they are now on pretty good terms.\n\n\u201cBoth decided it was crucial for the children that they had a respectful relationship.\n\nThe key thing is that they agree to custody sharing, with Brad having access and working with Angelina on logistic issues about work and travel.\n\n\u201cThere were rumours the divorce was being called off, but that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\nThe pair split in 2016, with Angelina requesting sole custody of the kids.\n\nThere were accusations Brad was involved in a physical clash with son Maddox, 16, on a plane.\n\nA temporary deal last year gave him visitation rights to Maddox, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and Vivienne and Knox, nine.\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220.\n\nWe pay for videos too.
