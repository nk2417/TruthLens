Here\u2019s the lowdown on her royal title and whether it will change if he becomes King\u2026\n\nWhat will happen when Charles becomes King?\n\nIf Prince Charles takes the throne and becomes The King of England after his mother Queen Elizabeth, both the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will move up the line of succession.\n\nPrince William will likely become the Prince of Wales and Kate will hold a very special title as the Princess of Wales.\n\nThe last time someone was named the Princess of Wales was William\u2019s late mother, Princess Diana.\n\nWhen William takes the throne will Kate be Queen?\n\nOnce Prince William then takes the throne and becomes the King of England, Kate will then be the Queen Consort.\n\nKate, 37, will only hold the title of Queen Consort, and not be The Queen of England in the same way the sovereign is now.\n\nAll females who marry sovereigns are styled as Queen Consorts, except in rare cases.\n\nWhile males are officially the consort, they may be referred to as Prince, as with the Queen and Prince Philip, although they can be referred to as Prince Consorts.\n\nWhereas Kate will not be the official Queen, Princess Charlotte has the potential to hold that title, just like her great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nPrincess Charlotte is fourth in line to the throne, after Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George, but will be ahead of her new brother, even though he is male, due to a change in the law of primogeniture.\n\nPreviously boys took precedence over any older siblings if they were girls, but new legislation was created before Prince George\u2019s birth ending this tradition.\n\nCamilla Parker Bowles, who is line before Kate, will technically become the Queen Consort also, but it has been said Camilla will adopt the style of Princess Consort.\n\nWhat\u2019s Kate Middleton\u2019s royal title now?\n\nKate Middleton\u2019s title is Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nThe morning of her wedding to Prince William he was created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn and Baron Carrickfergus.\n\nKate assumes all the feminine titles of her husband, and her full title and style is Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge, Countess of Strathearn and Lady Carrickfergus.\n\nIn Scotland she is also styled as Her Royal Highness The Countess of Strathearn.\n\nWhen Kate married Prince William, she also technically became Mrs Prince William.\n\nBut Kate is not referred to as a princess as she was not born into the role, whereas Princess Charlotte is as she was born into royalty.\n\nWhat will it be when Prince William is King?\n\nIt is widely assumed Kate will assume the official title of Queen Consort Catherine, but it is likely she will be referred to as Queen, or Queen Catherine.\n\nThe last predecessor in that role was the Queen Mother.\n\nLady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon married Prince Albert, Duke of York, in 1923, and she assumed the feminine form of his titles.\n\nWhen he became King in 1936, she became the Queen Consort, but was referred to as the Queen.\n\nShe was officially styled Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother following the death of her husband.\n\nIt is the normal style for the widow of a King to assume the title Queen accompanied by their name.\n\nIn this case it was Queen Elizabeth, but this was too close to her daughter and current monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, so the Queen Mother was adopted to avoid confusion.\n\nThis is when the Duchess\u2019 baby arrived and all the baby name predictions.\n\nHere are the weird royal rules she had to follow.\n\nAnd who\u2019s next in line to the throne and where do Meghan Markle\u2019s future children come?", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000287723392.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000004871985.jpg?strip=all&w=813", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000386227144.jpg?strip=all&w=532", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict0003861269171.jpg?strip=all&w=814", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000183386853.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000386227144-e1520595880142.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1155&h=1080&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000386227144-e1520595880142.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1155&h=1080&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/5765311/kate-middleton-queen-official-royal-title-prince-william-king/", "title": "What is Kate Middleton\u2019s royal title, will it change when Prince William becomes King and will she ever be Queen?", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
