The musical, a remake of the 1970s drama starring Barbra Streisand (also a remake of the 1937 and 1954 versions) chronicles the life of a small-town girl who moves to the big city to become a star. Cooper plays Jackson Maine, a has-been rock singer with an alcohol problem, to Gaga's Ally, the talented small-town girl in question. The plot mostly stays true to the original, showcasing the pitfalls and inevitable romance between Jackson and Ally along her rise to stardom.\n\nCooper opened up about his experience shooting the film in April, telling Vulture, \"[Gaga] said right from the beginning that there would be a barter. [She said] 'I'm gonna rely on you to get a performance that's honest out of me' [...] 'and I'm gonna make sure that you're going to turn into a musician. Because we're going to sing everything live.' And I went, 'Wait, what?'\"\n\nThat's correct: Bradley Cooper will be singing live in the movie! Gaga reportedly told the 43-year-old actor that she wasn't a fan of movie stars lip-syncing to a prerecorded song in films. \"She's right!\" he agreed. \"[Singing live] was terrifying, and I really relied on her. I spent about a year and a half taking vocal lessons and preparing.\" Even though the movie took only 42 days to shoot, Cooper revealed it took three years for him to fully get into character.", "images": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/3gPS_IDGcih5UPrlXKslJH7L4o4=/fit-in/792x529/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2018/04/26/779/n/1922283/tmp_dtGlEc_5dfac92af2d40a0d_ASIB-03547rv3.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/gzRLocBHEZxJ_T3jNEdsFOPI40E=/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2017/04/18/768/n/1922398/315717d8f1fae25d_AG_819923_014.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/h_CDTJ-Qu1hAm3EppZ2I-y5Dd9c=/fit-in/6016x3143/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2018/04/26/781/n/1922283/7930a0ca5ae2100d39cb50.64932101_.jpg", "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/nSbzyEJ8X9E/hqdefault.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/h_CDTJ-Qu1hAm3EppZ2I-y5Dd9c=/fit-in/6016x3143/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2018/04/26/781/n/1922283/7930a0ca5ae2100d39cb50.64932101_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Terry Carter", "Updated On Oct", "At Pm"], "canonical_link": "https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/bradley-cooper-really-singing-star-born-44783827", "title": "Does Bradley Cooper Really Sing in A Star Is Born?
