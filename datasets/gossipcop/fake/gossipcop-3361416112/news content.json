The shirts were part of a limited-edition Kendall + Kylie capsule collection that were on sale for $125 a piece, but immediately pulled from the site following the controversy.\n\nShutterstock; courtesy Kendall + Kylie\n\nThe sisters faced quite the backlash after the shirt\u2019s design \u2014 which featured the sisters\u2019 faces superimposed over images of famous deceased musicians including Tupac Shakur, Notorious B.I.G. and Jim Morrison of The Doors \u2014 first hit the internet.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: All of the KarJenner Fashion and Beauty Controversies\n\nParis Jackson and Kelly and Sharon Osbourne spoke out, The Doors issued a cease and desist letter and Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s mom, Voletta Wallace shared her disappointment on Instagram.\n\nThe sisters issued an apology for their designs on Twitter soon after. \u201cThese designs were not well thought out and we deeply apologize to anyone that has been upset and/or offended, especially to the families of the artists. We are huge fans of their music and it was not our intention to disrespect these cultural icons in any way. The tee shirts have been pulled from retail and all images have been removed. We will use this as an opportunity to learn from these mistakes and again, we are very sorry,\u201d they wrote.\n\nLooking for more style content?

When deciding to work with one-of-a-kind repurposed vintage tees, it was not the brand\u2019s intent to offend anyone. These designs were randomly selected and not well thought out. The brand would like to apologize, especially to the artists that have been featured in the series. We did not mean to disrespect these icons and understand that we missed the mark completely. The designs have been removed. We sincerely apologize to the artists, their families and estates and anyone who may have been offended.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kendall and Kylie Jenner\u2019s Apology Is Not Enough for Notorious B.I.G.\u2019s Estate: \u2018This Matter Has Yet to Be Resolved\n\nThe representative for the brand also added that the allegations on behalf of the photographer were \u201ccompletely false,\u201d calling the lawsuit \u201cbaseless.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanada Inc., the licensee manufacturer of the K + K brand, purchased a very small quantity of vintage t-shirts with performer images already on them. Only two Tupac t shirts were sold before being pulled from distribution. Canada Inc. did not copy anyone\u2019s image, remove any copyright notice from any image, or attempt to exploit Mr. Miller\u2019s claimed right of publicity. There has been no infringement or violation of anyone\u2019s rights. \u201c", "images":
