The web publication said Trevor was shot while greeting fans after a concert in Orlando.\n\nSome of the details in the story matched that of the tragedy around US musician Christina Grimmie\u2018s death. The musician was shot dead in 2016 by a \"deranged\" fan as she signed autographs.\n\nThis is not the first time Trevor has been a victim of fake news, back in March it was reported that he died after an alleged \"car accident\".", "images": ["https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/arenaholdings-sandbox/1733820208740.svg", "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/7PQNROD6ARB4LIAA34XWWKB6CU.jpg?smart=true&auth=5a9723a16ed6549f7332d37e9a43839d50a2b9e15058f6a94bce2ee88b80d6fd&width=274&height=182", "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/NYC6BIJ3KBL3JM3IMTBH5DHFPI.jpg?auth=108b13cd016c40e3a6b550f2ab4a1c663a66ed4ea3dd21b4a7e977fe6eb5eddb&width=800&height=533&smart=true", "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/NYC6BIJ3KBL3JM3IMTBH5DHFPI.jpg?smart=true&auth=108b13cd016c40e3a6b550f2ab4a1c663a66ed4ea3dd21b4a7e977fe6eb5eddb&width=1200&height=630", "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/V2B23EAIFNLO3LNQMLTWAUBGOM.png?smart=true&auth=334f166b43d41381f65d5d336e54ea31ac0b8a24a44a680103bfc219fe03db6e&width=274&height=182", "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/Z7IIQVV2PFCVHFQTEMPYON4Q5Q.jpg?smart=true&auth=56be72e5043e510b7c053dc390d53c1e74fdf64d03d2ee8de01352f4d355b452&width=274&height=182", "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/NRGYMU3T3VBJLEOZ763KQ73LLI.jpeg?smart=true&auth=0becea75668c8b7fe003d8e2dcc59afca4586ba6b6a6e6b41a3dde508eb4cd56&width=274&height=182", "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/4ABZUQFNDJDM5AMSOWXYUE3AIQ.jpeg?smart=true&auth=b2b329fe6a3107a2bb8396532918e062134302e7460d549ef28efb29b1d9c61b&width=274&height=182"], "top_img": "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/NYC6BIJ3KBL3JM3IMTBH5DHFPI.jpg?smart=true&auth=108b13cd016c40e3a6b550f2ab4a1c663a66ed4ea3dd21b4a7e977fe6eb5eddb&width=1200&height=630", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.timeslive.co.za/tshisa-live/tshisa-live/2017-07-25-trevor-noah-shuts-down-fake-death-rumours-again/", "title": "Trevor Noah shuts down fake death rumours - again", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "The internet went ahead and killed comedian Trevor Noah again, but he has come out to prove that he is alive and kicking.
