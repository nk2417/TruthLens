Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nRumors began to swirl when fans realized Tyga had not made an appearance on Jenner's social media since Valentine's Day of that year.\n\nLater in the month, Tyga's ex-fiance\u00e9 Blac Chyna heavily suggested in a Snapchat rant that he had been cheating on Jenner, as reported by Cosmopolitan.\n\n\"Multiple sources\" confirmed the split to People in early April. At the time, these sources framed the break-up as a brief separation \u2014 which seemed consistent with the couple's on-and-off relationship.\n\n\"They tend to take little breaks all the time and then get back together,\" says one insider. \"It's definitely possible they'll work things out again.\"\n\nJenner later opened up about the split on an episode of \"Life of Kylie,\" stating that the two will \"always have a bond.\"\n\n\"There was absolutely nothing wrong with me and T,\" she revealed. \"There was no crazy fight. We decided \u2014 well, I decided \u2014 that I'm really young.

Fan photos revealed that Jenner and Scott were holding hands as they roamed the grounds of the famous music festival.\n\nA source told People at the time that the two had been \"a thing\" before and \"friends for a while\" \u2014 but also implied that their flirtation was designed to make Tyga jealous. In reality, the two just \"hit it off\" and had immediate chemistry, according to Jenner's former best friend Jordyn Woods.\n\nJenner opened up about the beginning of their relationship to GQ and revealed that, after Coachella, she spontaneously decided to join Scott on his tour.\n\n\"He said, 'I'm going back on tour \u2014 what do we want to do about this?' Because we obviously liked each other,\" she said. \"And I was like, 'I guess I'm going with you' ...

Kylie Jenner/YouTube\n\nAfter deciding to \"ride off into the sunset\" and join Scott on his tour, Jenner and her new beau had \"a lot of downtime\" to get to know each other.\n\n\"It was organic. And we would just go to these random cities. We got to not be who we really were,\" she told GQ. \"Everything happened for a reason. We weren't going out as 'Kylie and Trav.' We would just be in Cleveland, walking the street for hours. We would go on walks, and no one would bother us.\"\n\nOn May 3, Us Weekly reported that the couple was getting serious.\n\n\"Travis is telling friends that he and Kylie are the real deal,\" a source told the magazine.\n\nThe reality star had been spotted celebrating Scott's birthday in New York City with her sister Kendall Jenner and other friends.

While the song never explicitly mentions Jenner, he does rap about a girl who \"caught the waves.\"\n\n\"Need ya love, not a need it is a must / Feelin' stuck, you know how to keep me up / Icy love, icy like a hockey puck,\" he raps.\n\nThe day after the song was released, Scott posted a photo of Jenner on his Instagram with the caption, \"BUTTERFLY EFFECT \ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b\ud83e\udd8b.\"\n\nButterflies would later become an important motif for the couple.\n\nJune 12, 2017: Jenner filmed herself listening to Scott's verse on SZA's 'Love Galore'\n\nSZA and Scott in the \"Love Galore\" music video.

I think it's kind of wild that everyone is just assuming that that's just happening,\" she told the site. \"Something happens every single day. You never know what is going to break at any moment.\"\n\nFans noticed that the makeup mogul had begun to only post throwback photos, outfits with baggy clothes, or portraits on Instagram \u2014 and quickly became obsessed with spotting Jenner's baby bump.\n\nNovember 11, 2017: Jenner sparked engagement rumors\n\nJenner took to Snapchat to show off a massive sparkler on her left ring finger.

So Jenner rented out an entire Six Flags for a birthday celebration. Their friend group shared numerous photos of the outing on Instagram.\n\nThe couple also celebrated with a cake in the shape of a roller coaster, featuring little figurines of the two with their daughter.\n\nMay 1, 2018: The Jenner-Webster family took their first vacation all together\n\nJenner and Scott took their 3-month-old daughter to Turks and Caicos, sharing several family photos and romantic beach shots.\n\nMay 3, 2018: Scott released a song that seems to feature Jenner's vocals\n\nScott is one of rap's best-selling stars. Dia Dipasupil/ Ari Perilstein/ Getty\n\nScott released a new song called \"Watch,\" which features contributions from rapper Lil Uzi Vert, Scott's pseudo brother-in-law Kanye West, and possibly Jenner herself.\n\nIn the last 30 seconds of Scott's song, a feminine voice can be heard speaking (or, one could argue, rapping) a couple of lines. Many fans are convinced that the voice belongs to Jenner \u2014 and that she references the couple's daughter in the lyrics.\n\nBecause the actual words are muffled and difficult to hear clearly, fans have been speculating that Jenner was saying, \"We got bust down Rollies, bust down Pateks / And I told him I wanted to have a bust down baby.\" \"Bust down\" is a colloquial term for \"expensive,\" particularly when it comes to jewelry or watches, like a Rolex.\n\nThe outro lyrics have since been edited twice on the popular lyrics website Genius, and now read, \"And I told him I needed him to bust down our new baby.\"\n\nMay 7, 2018: Jenner and Scott made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala\n\nScott and Jenner at the 2018 Met Gala.

He was like, 'We gotta go,' and I'm just like half asleep, like, 'What do you mean? What do you mean?' And he just starts pulling me, and the sun was just coming up, and he had flowers all the way down his house and violin players everywhere,\" she said.\n\nThe couple posed for sweet photos together for the GQ cover story \u2014 one of which Jenner posted on her own Instagram with the caption \"home.\" The magazine also made a video where Jenner asks Scott 23 questions about herself, and tests how many he gets right (he doesn't know her dogs' names, for example, but he can identify her exact pizza order).\n\nAugust 3, 2018: Scott released his third studio album 'Astroworld,' which features lyrics about Jenner\n\n\"Astroworld\" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.
