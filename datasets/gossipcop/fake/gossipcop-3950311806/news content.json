Her last big release Mother\u2019s Day \u2013 in 2016 \u2013 was a critical flop, while The Yellow Birds, made by her production company Echo Films, received a lukewarm reception on its release last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough much was made of Jennifer buying the film rights to hit Aussie author Liane Moriarty\u2019s What Alice Forgot in 2015, the project hasn\u2019t got much further in development, while Dumplin\u2019, a musical comedy also made by Echo, was filmed last year but still doesn\u2019t have a specific release date or any overseas distribution deals.\n\nRelated: Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston\u2019s second wedding joy\n\nRelated: Brad Pitt tells: \u2018Jen\u2019s a great mum to my kids\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, reports say Jen and Reese Witherspoon\u2019s much hyped Apple TV series about morning television \u2013 in which they both star and co-produce \u2013 is already in trouble.\n\n\u2018Jennifer is worried that her days are numbered and that her career is really drying up \u2013 she turns 50 next birthday and she\u2019s had box-office flop after box-office flop. She is doing everything she can to make a Friends reunion happen because she knows that will skyrocket her back on speed dial with all the Hollywood bosses and revive her career \u2013 but it just doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s happening any time soon,\u2019 explains the insider.\n\nWhether or not Jennifer\u2019s chance of making a go of things at Netflix is under threat, the embattled star is feeling the heat.\n\n\u2018Jen is worried she\u2019s running out of options. If someone or something has taken aim at Jen and her career, it might knock her out once and for all.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor the full story see this week\u2019s issue of New Idea \u2013 out now!", "images": ["https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/29538/ni-cover.jpg?resize=1024%2C614", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d683f9a7086cf5b4d843157e497fddc673a3321799da7d0d3a9507a9b5e7998e?s=128&d=mm&r=g", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/chrissie-swan-the-shortcut-queen-691e509abfe28.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-20t164344.876-691eaa9997406.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-18t103613.659-691bb21f4c9ec.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/71038/michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-hollywood.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/Logo-1.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/131095/untitled-design-2023-11-08t103411331.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/icon-phosphor-circle.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-19t145321.000-691d3f406e345.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/29614/jen-aniston.jpg?resize=722%2C1024", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/07/NIFLOGO_Organge.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/gettyimages-2156373625-691bc2c3a0fcf-scaled.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/121578/untitled-design-4.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/ni2546pm1_marketing-cover_v0.1-691a9098143bf-scaled.jpg?resize=1955%2C2560", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/air-fryer-1-691eadfe53bed.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-19t134714.374-691d2fbe0f750.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/07/wordpress-featured-image-template-11-6863926196e99.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-19t162531.737-691d54db7671a.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-18t112445.554-691bbcd84c0f3.png?resize=380%2C285"], "top_img": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nikki Black", "Nikki Is Obsessed With All Things Celebrity", "Dreams She Is A Long-Lost Kardashian.
