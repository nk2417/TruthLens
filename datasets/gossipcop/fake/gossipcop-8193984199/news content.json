How do you guys ever know? What are the clues?\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Well they don\u2019t make it obvious like that. That would be creepy if you were like just looking somebody up and down,\u2019 Ellen replied.\n\n\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know how it works,\u2019 laughed Jen.\n\n\n\nEllen retorted: \u2018It\u2019s just I don\u2019t know, flirty or something. But I do think girls had crushes on you. Well it\u2019s too late now!\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 Jennifer responded, keeping quiet about the news of her split.\n\n\n\nJennifer and Justin, 46 issued a statement via their publicist yesterday confirming they had gone their separate ways late last year.\n\n\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\nIt read: \u2018In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\n\n\n\n\u2018Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly.\n\n\n\n\u2018Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else\u2019s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.\u2019\n\n\n\nThe pair first met on the set Ben Stiller and Jack Black comedy Tropic Thunder in 2007.\n\n\n\nThey met once again on 2012\u2019s Wanderlust and began dating shortly after, before tying the knot in a surprise ceremony at their LA home in August 2015.\n\nAdvertisement", "images":
