Promise.\n\n18 min read\n\nPsst: This timeline is in reverse chronological order. To go back, back to the beginning, scroll alllll the way down.\n\n\n\nTaylor Swift must have learned a lot from the super-public mess that was her relationship with Tom \u201cQuestionable Taste in Tank Tops\u201d Hiddleston, because her \u2019ship with British actor Joe Alwyn has been absurdly private. Like, these two never even officially walked a red carpet together in the almost six years they dated.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the bad news (at least for those of us who are incredibly nosy, aka me). The good news is if you\u2019re willing to sleuth around the thirstiest corners of the fandom, there\u2019s actually a lot to discover about Taylor and Joe\u2019s pre-breakup relationship. On that note\u2026.\n\nMay 23, 2023\n\nJoe makes his first post-breakup appearance at a Celine dinner in Cannes.\n\nInstagram\n\nMay 18, 2023\n\nSeems like Joe isn\u2019t thrilled about Taylor dating Matty Healy! A source tells the Daily Mail that \u201cJoe feels slighted and is distraught after seeing her budding relationship with Matt but is doing his best to keep busy and focus on himself.\u201d\n\nApparently, \u201cJoe was aware that Taylor and Matt were making music together and collaborating\u201d and \u201cshe told him that they had become friends and he trusted her.\u201d But before you jump to any conclusions, the insider denies \u201coverlap\u201d between Joe and Matty.\n\nMay 1, 2023\n\nFans notice that Taylor has seemingly deleted an Instagram reel on which she chats about her relationship with Joe and says, \u201cLike, my relationship for six years, we\u2019ve had to dodge weird rumors, tabloid stuff, and we just ignore it. This song is sort of about the act of ignoring that stuff to protect the real stuff.\u201d\n\nApril 20, 2023\n\nFans notice that a bunch of Taylor\u2019s friends have seemingly unfollowed Joe on Instagram!\n\nApril 13, 2023\n\nOctavio Jones/TAS23 // Getty Images\n\nTaylor vaguely alludes to her and Joe\u2019s breakup while resuming her Eras Tour in Tampa, asking the crowd, \u201cIs it just me, or do we have a lot of things to catch up on?\u201d and then adding, \u201cIt\u2019s been a really long time since I\u2019ve been on tour. And to say that a lot has happened is an understatement.\u201d\n\nApril 10, 2023\n\nA People insider drops more info about what caused Taylor and Joe\u2019s breakup. The short answer? \u201cDifferences in their personalities.\u201d The long answer?\n\n\u201cThey had plenty in common and fell in love in a safe bubble while she was retreating from the world during Reputation. Then the pandemic hit, and they were locked down together and able to continue growing their relationship in this insulated way. But he didn\u2019t really \u2018know\u2019 her yet outside of that bubble.\u201d\n\nOh, and \u201cJoe has struggled with Taylor\u2019s level of fame and the attention from the public,\u201d says the source. \u201cThe differences in their personalities have also become harder to ignore after years together. They\u2019ve grown apart.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Swifties dust off footage of Tay holding back tears while performing \u201cChampagne Problems\u201d back in March\u2014around the time she and Joe were going through their breakup:\n\nApril 8, 2023\n\nEntertainment Tonight reports that Taylor and Joe have broken up after six years together, sending shock waves through the Swiftie community. According to Entertainment Tonight\u2019s report, Taylor and Joe actually split amicably \u201ca few weeks ago.\u201d The outlet describes the breakup as \u201cnot dramatic\u201d and is told by a source that \u201cthe relationship had just run its course. It\u2019s why [Joe] hasn\u2019t been spotted at any shows.\u201d\n\nMarch 17, 2023\n\nTaylor drops an unreleased tracked from Lover called \u201cAll of the Girls You Loved Before,\u201d which fans are fully convinced is about Joe. More specifically, his exes. Listen here!\n\nJanuary 27, 2023\n\nMs. Taylor appears to give a subtle nod to Joe in her new music video for \u201cLavender Haze.\u201d\n\nEagle-eyed fans are quick to point out that a shot of a vinyl cover for another one of her songs, \u201cMastermind,\u201d displays two constellations on the cover: Sagittarius, aka Tay\u2019s astrological sign, and Pisces, which is Joe\u2019s.\n\nAugust 28, 2022\n\nTaylor is spotted dashing through the snow NYC streets hand in hand with Joe after a VMAs after-party at Fleur Room. Luckily, Twitter user @TheSwiftSociety posts a clip of the duo making a run for it and heading straight into a ~getaway car~ for the world to see. Talk about staying true to the brand!!\n\n\n\nAugust 24, 2022\n\nTay and Joe are photographed grabbing dinner with the singer\u2019s longtime friend Lena Dunham at private members club Casa Cipriani.\n\nJuly 14, 2022\n\nTaylor and Joe are spotted walking around London in photos exclusively published by the Daily Mail, and everyone immediately zooms in on Tay\u2019s hand only to discover that she is not wearing a ring on her finger. Which is noteworthy because The Sun dropped a report claiming they were engaged, noting that Taylor has been wearing the ring \u201cbehind closed doors.\u201d\n\n\u201cTaylor and Joe are incredibly happy and very, very in love,\u201d the source claimed. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually been engaged for a few months but have only told their inner-inner circle\u2014basically immediate family and trusted, very old friends. Everyone has been sworn to secrecy too.\u201d\n\nJune 22, 2022\n\nTay and Joe are spotted making out in the Bahamas. No bigs! Nothing to see here! JK, there\u2019s a lot to see, so head below:\n\nRelated Story Here\u2019s Taylor and Joe Kissing in the Bahamas\n\nMay 10, 2022\n\nJoe is asked how Taylor feels about his sex scenes in Conversations With Friends and has this to say:\n\n\u201cI mean, she\u2019s read the book and she loves the book, so she knows it. And she just, like, couldn\u2019t be a bigger fan of the project.\u201d\n\nNoted!\n\nApril 30, 2022\n\nJoe talks about winning his first Grammy in an interview with The Guardian and gives some insight into the dynamic between him and Taylor when it comes to writing songs. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like, \u2018It\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock, it\u2019s time to try and write a song together.\u2019 It came about from messing around on a piano and singing badly, then being overheard and being like, \u2018Let\u2019s see what happens if we get to the end of it together.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe adds that their collaboration was just something fun the two did during quarantine, \u201clike baking sourdough in lockdown,\u201d although winning the Grammy with his girlfriend was a \u201cridiculous bonus.\u201d #relatable\n\nApril 20, 2022\n\nThe actor takes a sec to finally (!!) address all the engagement rumors in an interview with WSJ magazine and, always true to his brand, he keeps things coy: \u201cIf I had a pound for every time I think I\u2019ve been told I\u2019ve been engaged, then I\u2019d have a lot of pound coins. I mean, the truth is, if the answer was yes, I wouldn\u2019t say, and if the answer was no, I wouldn\u2019t say.\u201d So it\u2019s not no\u2026.\n\nApril 13, 2022\n\nJoe dishes to Elle UK on the reason he doesn\u2019t discuss his relationship in interviews: \u201cIt\u2019s not really [because I] want to be guarded and private\u2014it\u2019s more a response to something else. We live in a culture that is so increasingly intrusive.\u2026The more you give\u2014and frankly, even if you don\u2019t give it\u2014something will be taken.\u201d\n\nMarch 26, 2022\n\nThe couple attends CAA\u2019s pre-Oscars party at the San Vicente Bungalows, and two sources speak to E! afterward about it. \u201cTaylor was introducing Joe to many people around her,\u201d the first source says. \u201cShe looked smitten and proud to be there with him.\u201d\n\nThe second source reveals the two \u201cwere very couple-y and cute and seemed happy to be there together. Taylor and Joe were together all night. He was leading her around introducing her to people, and Taylor [was] also introducing people to Joe. When Joe was leading Taylor around, he held his arm around her back.\u201d Hmm\u2026I\u2019m suspecting physical touch might be Joe\u2019s love language?\n\nFebruary 18, 2022\n\nLife & Style reports the duo is engaged, although neither of their reps comment on the rumor. Around this time, a source speaks to Entertainment Tonight and although they don\u2019t outright mention the engagement, they do say Taylor and Joe prefer to keep their relationship private. (Which, duh!) \u201cThey\u2019ve been enjoying their time as a couple. They have spoken about their future together and feel very secure about their relationship.\u201d\n\nThe source adds that the two have mastered juggling their careers and relationship, saying, \u201cThey\u2019re supportive of each other\u2019s careers and of each other in general. Both of them have been busy with work and they completely understand how to balance hectic schedules and still make time for each other. It\u2019s part of why their relationship really works.\u201d S\u2019cute!\n\nFebruary 9, 2022\n\nWhile discussing his upcoming Hulu show Conversations With Friends, Joe says: \u201cI think people can do what they want and makes them happy. I\u2019m obviously happy in a monogamous relationship.\u201d\n\nJanuary 2022\n\nThe couple is given a \u201cthank you\u201d credit for the film Sharp Stick, which was directed and written by Lena Dunham. Lena explains that Taylor and Joe got to critique the film early on, noting, \u201cThey are just really great friends of mine who watched a really early cut of the film and gave me notes. They\u2019re both just really interesting, perceptive people. Taylor\u2019s been one of my close friends for a really long time and Joe is an actor who I actually ended up working with on a project that I shot just a few months after this.\u201d @ Lena, we\u2019re always free to critique too. Just saying!\n\nDecember 19, 2021\n\nJoe posts a series of photos probs from the set of The Stars at Noon with director Claire Denis, and Taylor Likes it within minutes. Goals, if you ask us.\n\nJoe Alwyn // Instagram\n\nOctober 11, 2021\n\n\u201cBetty,\u201d which the pair cowrote, wins an award for Most Performed Song of the Year at the BMI London Awards. Okay, is there anything these two can\u2019t do?!\n\nSeptember 9, 2021\n\nWhile Joe is away filming Hulu\u2019s upcoming adaptation of Sally Rooney\u2019s novel Conversations With Friends, Taylor pays him a visit in Ireland. It\u2019s there that the singer dines at Shu Restaurant and takes photos with the staff. Needless to say, the pics are cute.\n\n\u201cOn Thursday evening, we had the pleasure of serving Taylor Swift!\u201d the restaurant shares on Instagram. \u201cTaylor was so lovely and really is a beautiful person inside and out and she kindly agreed to get photos with all our staff!\u201d\n\nMay 20, 2021\n\nEntertainment Tonight releases a story confirming rumors swirling about the couple\u2019s engagement are still alive and well.\n\n\u201cThey grew closer than ever during the quarantine and she really trusts him. They\u2019ve been continuing to be pretty low-key about their relationship to the outside world to continue to protect it.\u2026They\u2019ve discussed future plans and Taylor can see herself marrying Joe one day,\u201d a source reveals. *cue suspenseful music*\n\nMay 11, 2021\n\nAfter ~casually~ becoming the first woman and youngest person ever to win the BRIT Awards\u2019 Global Icon award, Taylor mentions Joe in her acceptance speech and it\u2019s truly \ud83e\udd7a. In the clip below, you can watch her smile when she says her BF\u2019s name around the 2:20 mark (ur welcome).\n\nMarch 14, 2021\n\n\n\nAfter Folklore wins Album of the Year at the 2021 Grammy Awards, the singer thanks her boyfriend onstage. \u201cJoe, who is the first person that I play every single song that I write, and I had the best time writing songs with you in quarantine,\u201d she says. We\u2019re not crying, you are!\n\nCBS Photo Archive // Getty Images\n\nFebruary 17, 2021\n\nTaylor opens up to Vanity Fair around the release of her documentary Miss Americana and talks about how Joe encouraged her to use her voice during the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nShe says, \u201cAs a country musician, I was always told it\u2019s better to stay out of [politics].\u2026The Trump presidency forced me to lean in and educate myself. I found myself talking about government and the presidency and policy with my boyfriend [Joe Alwyn], who supported me in speaking out. I started talking to my family and friends about politics and learning as much as I could about where I stand. I\u2019m proud to have moved past fear and self-doubt and to endorse and support leadership that moves us beyond this divisive, heartbreaking moment in time.\u201d\n\nJanuary 12, 2021\n\nIn case you still have concerns about the whole \u201cnever being pictured together\u201d thing, ~sources~ are here to make it clear Taylor and Joe are in it for the long haul.\n\n\u201cTaylor has gotten more and more comfortable being public with Joe and letting fans in on their romance in a way that she feels is still protecting it,\u201d a source tells Entertainment Tonight. \u201cShe loves Joe so much and, of course, is not trying to hide their relationship, but she prefers to keep specific details private.\u201d\n\nFans def knew that last part, but the rest is good intel!\n\nJanuary 11, 2021\n\nTaylor and Joe are seen in London while on a walk with Joe\u2019s mother, Elizabeth. The two look v cute and cozy in winter gear, and according to sources who spoke with E!, the singer has been traveling back and forth between Nashville and London to spend time with her and her boyfriend\u2019s family. \ud83e\udd7a\n\nDecember 16, 2020\n\n\n\nTaylor seemingly can\u2019t stop talking about Joe and their collaborations! Taylor cowrote a song with Joe on her second surprise album of 2020, Evermore, and in an Apple Music interview she said, \u201cJoe and I really love sad songs\u2026we\u2019ve always bonded over music\u2026we write the saddest [songs]. We just really love sad songs. What can I say?\u201d\n\n\n\nSpeaking about their song \u201cChampagne Problems\u201d from Evermore, Taylor says:\n\n\u201cHe started that one and came up with the melodic structure of it\u2026and I say it was a surprise that we started writing together, but in a way, it wasn\u2019t because we have always bonded over music and had the same musical tastes. And he\u2019s always the person who\u2019s showing me songs by artists and then they become my favorite songs or whatever. But yeah, \u2018Champagne Problems,\u2019 that was one of my favorite bridges to write. I really love a bridge where you tell the full story in the bridge, like you really shift gears in that bridge. I\u2019m so excited to one day be in front of a crowd when they all sing, \u2018She would have made such a lovely bride. What a shame she\u2019s f*cked in the head.\u2019\u2026Because I know it\u2019s so sad. I know it\u2019s so sad, but it\u2019s those songs, like \u2018All Too Well\u2019\u2014performing the song \u2018All Too Well\u2019 is one of the most joyful experiences I ever go through when I perform live. So when there\u2019s a song like \u2018Champagne Problems\u2019 where you know it\u2019s so sad, you know that, but I love a sad song, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always just playing instruments and he doesn\u2019t do it in a strategic \u2018I\u2019m writing a song right now\u2019 thing,\u201d Taylor adds. \u201cHe\u2019s always done that. But do I think we would have taken the step of, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s see if there\u2019s a song in here. Let\u2019s write a song together\u2019? If we hadn\u2019t been in lockdown, I don\u2019t think that would have happened, but I\u2019m so glad that it did.\u201d\n\n\n\nA People source also had insight into their relationship these days, and it sounds like things between Taylor and Joe have been nothing but smooth sailing. \u201cHe is her rock,\u201d says the source. \u201cTheir relationship is mature and wonderful.\u201d Love to hear it!\n\nDecember 15, 2020\n\n\n\nRemember that William Bowery theory in which fans speculated Joe was using a pseudonym for writing songs on Folklore? Welp, turns out it was 100 percent true. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion about William Bowery and his identity. He\u2019s not a real person.\u2026William Bowery is Joe, as we know. And Joe, Joe plays piano beautifully, and he\u2019s always just playing and making things up and kind of creating things,\u201d Taylor said on Jimmy Kimmel Live.\n\nNovember 13, 2020\n\nLooks like Folklore fans were worried for nothing because Taylor\u2019s fully out here talking about her song \u201cPeace\u201d with Paul McCartney in Rolling Stone and how it applies to her \u2019ship with Joe.\n\nShe said:\n\n\u201c\u2018Peace\u2019 is actually more rooted in my personal life. I know you have done a really excellent job of this in your personal life: carving out a human life within a public life and how scary that can be when you do fall in love and you meet someone, especially if you\u2019ve met someone who has a very grounded, normal way of living. I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalize things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives. I can\u2019t control if there\u2019s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow.\u201d\n\nPaul then asked Taylor if Joe can \u201csympathize with that and understand\u201d her life, to which she replied, \u201cOh, absolutely.\u201d Taylor elaborated: \u201cI think that in knowing him and being in the relationship I am in now, I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids.\u201d\n\nJuly 24, 2020\n\nWell. Can we talk about that new Folklore album? And how it really sounds like Taylor and Joe have broken up?! If you haven\u2019t had an hour to dedicate to listening to Taylor\u2019s latest project, lyrics like, \u201cWaking up alone. But we were something, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d have fans fully freaking out.\n\nBut before you get too carried away, remember that in her album announcement, Taylor said, \u201cIn isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory.\u201d\n\nSo this album isn\u2019t necessarily based on her personal experiences, okay? Okay.\n\n\n\nJuly 23, 2020\n\nTaylor made a surprise announcement that she\u2019ll drop a brand-new album tonight, and fans are convinced that Joe wrote two songs on Folklore. You see, in her Instagram announcement, Taylor tagged all but one of her collaborators.\n\nAfter trying to find out who \u201cWilliam Bowery\u201d is to no avail, Swifties are wondering if it\u2019s a pseudonym for Joe. After all, she did make the album while in quarantine, and she was quarantining with him. Also, Taylor and Joe met at the Bowery Hotel, so\u2026.\n\nApril 30, 2020\n\nJoe posts a picture of Taylor\u2019s cat and basically confirms they\u2019ve been quarantining together.\n\nInstagram\n\nMarch 24, 2020\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, the couple is reportedly talking about marriage, but they don\u2019t have a date set. Their source added, \u201cTaylor considers Joe one of the only safe constants in her life. He has always been a huge support and stuck by her.\u201d\n\nFebruary 12, 2020\n\nJoe and Taylor kiss at the NME Awards. Their PDA moment was caught on camera by a fan in attendance and can be viewed right this way.\n\nJanuary 31, 2020\n\nTaylor releases her Miss Americana Netflix documentary and briefly talks about Joe. She said, \u201cI also was falling in love with someone who had a really wonderfully normal, balanced, grounded life and we decided together that we wanted our relationship to be private.\u201d\n\nJanuary 5, 2020\n\nTaylor and Joe walk the red carpet (separately) at the 2020 Golden Globes. During an after-party, the two reportedly \u201cappeared smitten.\u201d\n\nOctober 5, 2019\n\nTaylor and Joe are photographed holding hands on the way to a Saturday Night Live after-party following her performance on the show. Clearly, they\u2019re getting more comfortable with PDA because they definitely aren\u2019t trying to hide their vibes in front of this sea of photogs!\n\nGetty Images\n\nAccording to Us Weekly sources, the couple hit up a restaurant with Gigi Hadid that same night and couldn't keep their hands off each other. \u201cThey were definitely very cozy with each other. Taylor was on Joe\u2019s arm the whole night and [they] were definitely holding hands a bunch,\u201d a source says, adding, \u201cThey were surprisingly warm and intimate toward one another the whole evening.\u201d\n\nAugust 24, 2019\n\nTaylor makes it clear during an interview with The Guardian that she\u2019s never, e-v-e-r going to talk about Joe. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that if I do [talk about it], people think it\u2019s up for discussion, and our relationship isn\u2019t up for discussion,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we\u2019d be talking about it\u2014but it\u2019s just that it goes out into the world. That\u2019s where the boundary is, and that\u2019s where my life has become manageable. I really want to keep it feeling manageable.\u201d\n\nAugust 22, 2019\n\nTaylor Swift\u2019s album Lover leaks and fans swarm Twitter with theories that she and Joe are secretly engaged/married. Mostly thanks to lyrics in the title track that go, \u201cI take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover / My heart\u2019s been borrowed and yours has been blue.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re currently like, \u201cWTF does this even mean?\u201d apparently, the words \u201cborrowed\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d made everyone spiral because of the whole \u201csomething borrowed, something blue\u201d wedding tradition. A reach, I know, but tell that to the internet:\n\nAugust 14, 2019\n\nTaylor drops the lyric video for \u201cLover\u201d and fans manage to convince themselves the entire song is about Joe. Even the part about leaving \u201cChristmas lights up till January.\u201d It\u2019s a lot!\n\nTo be fair, the lyric \u201cI\u2019ve loved you three summers now, honey\u201d IS pretty telling. Remember how Joe and Taylor met in 2016? Yeah.\n\n\n\nMay 24, 2019\n\nTaylor and Joe are spotted holding hands in Paris in a unicorn-levels-of-rare PDA moment:\n\nBACKGRID\n\nMarch 21, 2019\n\nA source tells People that Joe has \u201czero interest in being a celebrity\u201d and that his and Taylor\u2019s \u201cpersonalities are very compatible, and they\u2019re respectful of each other\u2019s careers.\u201d\n\nThat explains a lot, to be honest.\n\nFebruary 24, 2019\n\nRemember the Academy Awards? When Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga eye-f*cked their way through \u201cShallow,\u201d causing the entire internet to melt down? Yeah, well, Joe hit the red carpet without Taylor\u2014buuut they were spotted PDA\u2019ing big time at the Vanity Fair Oscars after-party.\n\nFebruary 10, 2019\n\nTaylor and Joe hit up a BAFTAs party in London, where they\u2019re photographed all up on each other.\n\nAnd, like, fine, the pics above technically don\u2019t show either of their faces. But this is totally Taylor and if you need proof, JUST LOOK AT HER DRESS:\n\nNovember 22, 2018\n\nTaylor goes vaguely Instagram official with Joe\u2026by which I mean she shouts out his movie The Favourite. Obviously, this IG was posted before Taylor changed up her grid aesthetic or it would have been filtered pink and inexplicably covered in sparkles.\n\nOctober 18, 2018\n\nJoe awkwardly/finally talks about Taylor in an interview when a reporter asks what he thinks of her political efforts. His response, while literally backing away? \u201cI think it\u2019s great, I think it\u2019s important.\u201d Wow, he\u2019s a man of so many words!\n\nSeptember 28, 2018\n\nTaylor sneaks into the premiere of Joe\u2019s new movie The Favourite\u2014although she skips the red carpet and uses the back door to exit. For those of you who are all \u201cpics or it didn\u2019t happen,\u201d here ya go:\n\nGetty Images\n\nSeptember 20, 2018\n\nJoe is interviewed by British Vogue and fully SHUTS THEM DOWN when asked about dating Taylor, saying, \u201cI\u2019m aware people want to know about that side of things.
