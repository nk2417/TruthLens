I think that he\u2019s great at that; it\u2019s always been a passion of his,\u201d she said. \u201cHe puts his own spin on the houses, so I think it\u2019s amazing.

I think I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I just felt like we needed to make a change and not be so critical.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been a family who will do anything for each other and we know that at the end of the day, but sometimes there\u2019s criticism and I felt not good hanging out with them everyday and I couldn\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d said Kardashian. \u201cSo you\u2019ll see in the season how it plays
