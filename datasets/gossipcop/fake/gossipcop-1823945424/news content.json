They sit in their garage and write shite like 'Sign of the Times' for Harry Styles. Which, quite frankly, my cat could have written in about 10 minutes!\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't mind the song, my wife was falling over herself, 'Have you heard Harry Styles' new song? It's like Prince'. I was like, 'Without even hearing it, I can assure you it's not like Prince!'\"\n\nColumbia Records\n\nThere was bit more positivity from Noel's brother Liam, speaking in an interview with ES Magazine.\n\nLiam said: \"I don't mind it, man. There's some interesting bits in it. I mean, I don't know how it f*king goes, but fair play to him. I'm sure, like, it's a bigger f**king cost.\n\n\"I've got the weight of Oasis still hanging over me and I'm sure I'll always be that guy from Oasis, so I'm sure he's carrying an equal weight. If he wants to get out of that pop world and into something with a bit more substance I think that's a good thing.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nLast night saw Liam Gallagher perform his first solo gig in Manchester, raising funds for the victims of the suicide bombing in the city last week.\n\nThe 44-year-old \u2013 soon to release his debut solo album As You Were \u2013 sold out his show at Manchester's 1,400-capacity O2 Ritz in a matter of minutes.\n\nAfter the devastating bombing at Manchester Arena that killed 22, Liam told the crowd he wanted to \"try and help pick people up\", as he showcased both new tracks and some Oasis classics.\n\nThe British Red Cross and Manchester City Council are leading fundraising efforts to support those affected by the Manchester terror attacks.
