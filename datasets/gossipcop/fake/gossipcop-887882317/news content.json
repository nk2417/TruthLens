Scott Disick looks miserable on day out in LA after ex Kourtney Kardashian \u2018blocked\u2019 Sofia Richie from meeting their kids\n\nSCOTT Disick was seen looking glum as he spent time with his son Mason in LA today \u2013 following the news Kourtney Kardashian has vetoed his new girlfriend from spending time with their children.\n\nThe reality star, who has Mason, Penelope and Reign with his ex, failed to raise a smile while treating Mason to some quality one on one time.\n\nDressed down, Scott, 34, wore a pair of cargo trousers and a black top, while Mason, 7, held onto his hand.\n\nTheir outing comes after The Sun Online revealed that the eldest sister isn\u2019t keen on Scott\u2019s 19-year-old girlfriend meeting their children just yet \u2013 and has told Scott to keep Sofia away.\n\n\u201cKourtney is a fierce mom, and she\u2019ll do whatever it takes to protect her kids,\u201d says the insider.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want them getting confused by Scott\u2019s new girlfriend \u2013 Mason is seven, old enough to understand a lot of things now, and Kourtney doesn\u2019t want them meeting another one of Scott\u2019s new girlfriends, only for her to disappear from their lives in a month.\n\n\u201cPlus, it would kill her to see another woman \u2018playing mom\u2019 to her kids in public. It would break her heart.\n\n\u201cThese past few months have been tough \u2013 she\u2019s had to co-parent with Scott, and keep things nice between mom and dad. She spoke to Scott and said Sofia can meet the kids in a few months \u2013 and he\u2019s agreed to do things her way \u2026 for now.\u201d\n\nSince Scott confirmed he was dating Lionel Richie\u2019s daughter Sofia in September, we\u2019ve seen him taking Mason, Penelope and Reign out in LA \u2013 but girlfriend Sofia hasn\u2019t been spotted with them.\n\nScott and Sofia have been on several loved-up holidays \u2013 to Miami, Venice, New York and to the Mexican villa where he first met Kourtney.\n\nKourtney has moved on from Scott with 23 year old model Younes Bendjima \u2013 but we haven\u2019t spotted him meeting Kourt and Scott\u2019s kids either.\n\nRecently on Keeping Up With The Kardashians, viewers saw an infuriated Kourtney ban Scott from seeing his kids during a wild party binge, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want the kids seeing him like this.\u201d\n\nShe also revealed to sister Khloe that Scott had sent her screaming messages threatening to beat up boyfriend Younes and offensive rants when she went on holiday with sister Kim.\n\nShe\u2019s also slammed her ex \u2013 who she dated for nine years before splitting in 2015 \u2013 for being photographed with \u201ca different hooker every day\u201d.\n\nThe Sun Online has contacted Kourtney\u2019s spokesperson for comment.\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000284774015.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tp-Adam-Peaty-1911_COMP.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict0003571451992.jpg?strip=all&w=707", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/newspress-collage-p268cpzha-1763555741197.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1763555778&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/holly-op-jk.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1763551153&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000361191734.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000301895708.jpg?strip=all&w=780", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ac-18_11-yaz-hadfield-comp.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/as-comp-scott.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict0003619642401.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000362554368.jpg?strip=all&w=901", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nintchdbpict000362554688.jpg?strip=all&w=696"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/as-comp-scott.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4768929/scott-disick-looks-miserable-on-day-out-in-la-after-ex-kourtney-kardashian-banned-sofia-richie-from-meeting-their-kids/", "title": "Scott Disick looks miserable on day out in LA after ex Kourtney Kardashian \u2018blocked\u2019 Sofia Richie from meeting their kids", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
