One of the first death hoaxes to spread online was the 2010 Morgan Freeman death hoax.On December 16th, 2010, Twitter user OriginalCJiZZle tweeted a message asserting that actor Morgan Freeman had died, prefaced by an RT (retweet) signature credited to CNN to make it appear as if the news organization had tweeted the original report:\n\n\"RT @CNN: Breaking News: actor Morgan Freeman has passed away in his Burbank home<< wow legendary actor #RIPmorganfreeman.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCNN quickly issued a response explaining that it had not reported on Freeman\u2019s death via Twitter :\n\n\"CNN did not report Morgan Freeman death. Rumor is false. CNN will aggressively investigate this hoax.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same day, CNN published an article titled \u201cWho said Morgan Freeman is dead? Not us,\" in which the news outlet reiterated their previous response and included a confirmation from the actor's publicist Stan Rosenfield that Freeman was still alive.\n\nNotable Cases\n\nSteve Jobs\n\nBetween Apple CEO Steve Jobs' announcement of his diagnosis in 2004 and his death in 2011, there had been a number of premature obituaries and breaking news updates falsely reporting on the passing of Apple's co-founder.

The report quickly spread through its corporate news service and the rumor intensified as blogs and other news carriers began syndicating the story.\n\nDuring the Macworld Keynote speech in January 2009, Apple-related forum MacRumors was infiltrated by a hacker who defaced the website with false news of Steve Job's death that read \"STEVE JOBS JUST DIED.\" The news media speculated that the hacker was associated with Anonymous and 4chan .\n\nIn September 2011, CBS reported via one of its Twitter accounts that Steve Jobs had passed from a heart attack. The post was removed within minutes with a formal retraction, but not before the information was re-tweeted by some of the account\u2019s 11,000+ followers.\n\nCher\n\nOn January 26th, 2012, Twitter user Lorraine Star tweeted out a rumor that singer Cher had died, making it appear as if the tweet had originated from CNN:\n\n\"RT @CNN: American recording artist Cher dies at 65 years old.

OMG\"\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rumor was dispelled on January 27th, when Loree Rodkin , a friend of the singer, tweeted:\n\n\"Whoever started that stupid rumor needs to have their face dragged across concrete..#cher is FINE\"\n\n\n\n\n\nAdele\n\nOn January 28th, 2012, RIP Adele was a trending topic on Twitter.

I was celebrating the birthday of my twins in Montreal and I was getting these phone calls saying there was stuff on Facebook that I was dead. The thing that worries me is my mom. It makes me a little mad \u2013 she's 86 years old and if I'm not on the phone telling her I'm OK four seconds after it's on the news\u2026 it doesn't matter what they say, it's the impact it has on your family.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nJustin Bieber\n\nOn January 8th, 2014, a rumor that singer Justin Bieber had died in a car crash after driving over 120 miles per hour in his Ferrari circulated on Twitter.

He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics responding to the vehicle accident and was identified by photo ID found on his body.
