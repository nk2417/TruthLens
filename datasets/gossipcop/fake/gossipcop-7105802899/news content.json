Style reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEx-flames Brad and Ange have been working together for the better part of 18 months to reach an agreement on the custody of their six children \u2013 Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne \u2013 and according to Life & Style, the former couple have managed to come to an agreement.\n\nThe publication\u2019s report reveals Brad was left \u2018devastated\u2019 when Ange told him she had planned to take their children to London with her for five months while she filmed Maleficent 2.\n\n\u2018Even though Brad knows Angelina has custody and he has visitation, he felt it was a major breach in their agreement,\u2019 a family friend spilled to the publication. \u2018He was livid.\u2019\n\nLife & Style claim Brad then waged a war on his ex-wife, and that he came out on top!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe friend tells, \u2018To keep him from contesting her London move, she promised Brad that he can spend longer periods of time with the kids before and after the trip.\u2019\n\n\u2018When he found out he was getting more time with them, Brad cried tears of joy,\u2019 the friend adds.\n\nThe Hollywood actor has since been spending much more time with his six children, something he considers a \u2018major victory.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLife & Style reveal the kids are \u2018ecstatic\u2019 to be spending more time with their dad.\n\nFriends close to the pair also reveal that although the kids love Ange, they \u2018always wanted to be with their Dad more.\u2019\n\nGetting sober and being in therapy has only made Brad\u2019s bond with his children stronger, the publication adds.\n\n\u2018He really feels he\u2019s turned a negative into a positive by getting more time with the kids,\u2019 says the family friend. \u2018He\u2019s never going to let them get too far away again.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFriends close to the star also revealed to PEOPLE that he is \u2018more like the old happy and charming Brad,\u2019\n\nAccording to the publication, the actor is in good spirits as he slowly begins to make his way back into the spotlight.\n\nBrad is yet to respond to Life & Style\u2019s report.", "images": ["https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-18t103613.659-691bb21f4c9ec.jpg?resize=380%2C285",
