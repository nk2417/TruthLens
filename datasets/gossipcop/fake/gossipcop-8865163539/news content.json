(Credit: Getty images)\n\nAccording to an outrageous report in US tabloid Star today, Kim is allegedly the subject of rumours that she\u2019s had ribs surgically removed in order to achieve an hourglass figure.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s no end to Kim\u2019s quest for perfection, but even her family is telling her this is madness,\u2019 an insider allegedly told Star of family reaction to the ridiculous procedure.\n\n\u2018Kim clearly enjoys the results \u2013 the procedure has given her the whittled middle she has always wanted \u2013 and considers it well worth the time and money spent.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRib removal \u2013 sometimes whispered about in celeb circles but never yet proven to actually occur \u2013 is seen by mainstream medicine as a dangerous and unethical procedure, as in theory it could potentially result in deadly injuries to internal organs in the case of an accident.\n\n\u2018No reputable doctor would remove body parts that have a critical purpose,\u2019 says plastic surgeon Dr Matthew Shulman. \u2018Ribs are there to protect your organs.\u2019\n\nKim has yet to comment on Star\u2018s outlandish allegations, but has in the past attributed her enviable figure to healthy eating and exercise.\n\nThe allegations are published in this week\u2019s US Star magazine.\n\nAdvertisement", "images":
