It was a huge mess, with hundreds of fans and photographers gathered around her. It was a real \u2018Israeli celebration\u2019; she didn\u2019t stop an excursion during any other part of her latest tour. This could only happen here.\u201d Britney landed in Israel on Sunday, on 2 July, 2017 and the country\u2019s Labour Party cancelled planned elections because of her concert at Tel Aviv\u2019s Yarkon Park on Monday night, which was attended by 50,000 of her fans. She also visited holy sites such as the city of Jerusalem during her stay. Meanwhile, the \u2018Hit Me Baby One More Time\u2019 hitmaker recently claimed she doesn\u2019t get the credit she deserves for her on-stage performances. Britney slammed suggestions she simply lip-syncs throughout her shows, insisting she has to mix her own voice with \u201ca little bit of playback\u201d because of her energy-sapping dance routines.
