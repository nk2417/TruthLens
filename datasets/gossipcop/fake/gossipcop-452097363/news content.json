She just wants to be on set working. So we had to make it as short an application as possible.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Kidman has undertaken a massive makeover for a role, after she donned prosthetics to play tortured author Virginia Woolf in The Hours.\n\nThat role won her the Academy Award for Actress in a Leading Role, so who knows that doors this latest venture might open up.\n\nMeanwhile, Kidman has just wrapped filming on the second season of Big Little Lies.\n\nAddressing her 1.7million followers, she said: \u2018That\u2019s a wrap on #BigLittleLies Season 2 filming! What a beautiful journey this has been with my Monterey 5 sisters and our passionate dedicated crew.\n\n\u2018Thank you HBO for the amazing opportunity and thank you Andrea Arnold for being our fearless leader, and of course the one and only Meryl Streep for believing in us. I love you all. xx\u2019\n\nMost of the original cast is expected to return including Reese Witherspoon, Nicole, Shailene, Zoe Kravitz and Laura Dern. Adam Scott has also confirmed that he will return as Madeline\u2019s husband, Ed.\n\nAnd we cannot wait.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
