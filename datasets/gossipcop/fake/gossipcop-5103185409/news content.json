The actor appears to be changing his looks after his very public divorce.\n\nAccording to OK! Magazine , Ben Affleck has been the center of plastic surgery rumors recently. The actor was spotted on the set of his new film, Live By Night , wearing some bandages, cuts, and bruises on his face. The plastic surgery rumors first started when Affleck\u2019s face has been looking smoother than usual. Several cosmetic surgeons have claimed that Affleck may have had some Botox and fillers.\n\nBen Affleck fuels plastic surgery rumors with bandaged and bruised appearance on film set \u2014 See the shocking photos! https://t.co/83uNJXF5fY \u2014 OK! Magazine USA (@OKMagazine) December 9, 2015\n\nOne of the doctors, a board-certified plastic surgeon named Dr. Lyle Back, who has not treated Ben, told RadarOnline that the actor does look different these days. But different doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s a good thing.\n\n\u201cHe looks different \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t look better. In fact, he doesn\u2019t look like himself at all! He\u2019s had the entire upper third of his face worked on, and the result is he looks more like Jack Nicholson\u2019s Joker than Batman.\u201d\n\nDr. Back then added that Affleck may have gotten Botox on his eyes.\n\n\u201cA small amount of Botox fills your wrinkles and makes you look relaxed and well rested. He\u2019s had so much put in that his eyebrows look jacked up and he\u2019s just downed 50 cups of coffee. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s a case of too much work where only a little was needed. Fat and skin has been trimmed from both above and below the eyes, and it\u2019s so starkly different that he might as well be Kenny Rogers.\u201d\n\nSo, is Ben Affleck\u2019s new look for the sake of his role? Or does he want to appear younger looking? He could be desperate to keep up with his Batman Vs. Superman co-star Henry Cavill.\n\nAccording to the report, since the 43-year-old has been in the news for allegedly cheating on his ex-wife Jennifer Garner with his children\u2019s nanny, sources close to Affleck claim that he\u2019s trying out a new look. Cosmetic surgery experts speculate that Affleck may have also gotten cheek fillers and laser skin treatments but has already done too much, way too soon.\n\nBen isn\u2019t just opting for a younger look on his face. He\u2019s also trying to look younger by dyeing his hair. According to the Daily Mail , the actor is taking the role of Bruce Wayne very seriously by dyeing his gray hair back to his dark brown locks. Ben has also been looking different in recent weeks due to his noticeable weight loss.\n\nHe really IS the Dark Knight!

Maybe it was for his recent appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live where he looked dapper and suave than usual. It\u2019s a departure from those photos of a down and out Affleck that were published over the summer, shortly after his divorce.\n\nThat\u2019s not the only thing that\u2019s different about Ben Affleck these days. Reports surfaced claiming that the actor has been hiding a huge Phoenix back tattoo from his fans and the rest of the world. Ben was spotted rocking a huge and unsightly tattoo on his back, but his fans thought it was for a movie role. Sources told TMZ that Ben\u2019s tattoo is the real deal . In fact, he\u2019s had the ink design for a few months now.\n\nPlastic surgery and a huge back tattoo?!?! Ben Affleck what is HAPPENING?!?!

But Affleck\u2019s colorful tattoo was just a \u201cwork in progress\u201d that happened shortly after his divorce from Garner. No, he didn\u2019t get the fresh ink after a wild night out. An insider told Us Weekly that a tattoo artist visited Affleck at his home to finish the design.\n\nBen Affleck \u2014 Massive Back Tattoo Is the Real Deal!!!
