{"url": "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_Is_Love", "text": "2018 studio album by the Carters\n\nEverything Is Love is the debut studio album by American musical superduo the Carters, consisting of spouses Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter and Shawn \"Jay-Z\" Carter. It was released on June 16, 2018, by their respective labels Parkwood Entertainment and Roc Nation \u2014 with distribution from Columbia Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z produced the album alongside a variety of collaborators, including Cool & Dre, Boi-1da, and Pharrell Williams. Additional vocalists recorded for the album include Williams, Quavo, Offset (both from Migos), and Ty Dolla Sign, among others. The hip-hop and R&B album incorporates soul and trap sounds, and its lyrics explore themes of romantic love, fame, wealth, and black pride.\n\nThe album was not made public until its release was announced by Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z while onstage at a London concert for their On the Run II Tour and later through their social media accounts. It was originally exclusive to the music distribution service Tidal, before given a wider release on June 18, 2018. Everything Is Love debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, and it reached the top five on charts in Canada, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, and the UK. At the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, the album won for Best Urban Contemporary Album.\n\nBackground and recording [ edit ]\n\nView of Paris La D\u00e9fense Arena (formerly named UArena), where the album was partially recorded.\n\nPlans about a joint album by the couple were announced by Jay-Z during an interview with The New York Times in 2017 when he said that they used \"art almost like a therapy session\" to create new music. However, since they also worked on their respective albums 4:44 and Lemonade, and Beyonc\u00e9's music progressed more rapidly, the project was temporarily stopped. Rumors about the collaborative project began emerging in March 2018 when the couple announced their On the Run II Tour.[1] The album was reportedly conceived for years.[2][3]\n\nThe majority of the album was recorded at U Arena in Paris; \"Friends\", \"Black Effect\" and \"Salud!\" were recorded at Kingslanding Studios West in Los Angeles, while further recording for \"Summer\" and \"Nice\" was done at The Church Studios in London. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z co-produced all of the songs on the album themselves, with further producers including Pharrell, Cool & Dre, Boi-1da, Jahaan Sweet, David Andrew Sitek, D'Mile, El Michels, Fred Ball, Illmind, MeLo-X, Mike Dean and Nav. The album was predominantly recorded by Stuart White and Gimel \"Young Guru\" Keaton.[4]\n\nMusic and lyrics [ edit ]\n\nMusic critics generally categorized Everything Is Love as hip-hop and R&B[5][6][7] with prominent influences of trap[8][9] and classic soul of the 1960s\u20131970s.[6][8][10] Craig Jenkins from Vulture wrote that Beyonc\u00e9 played the role of an \"R&B heavyweight\" doubling as a \"formidable rapper, showcasing her talents for vocal belting and complex rap cadences.[11] In a review for The New York Times, Jon Pareles opined that Everything Is Love exuded less vulnerability than Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's respective albums Lemonade and 4:44, with references to classic hip-hop, R&B, and \"disorienting electronic soundscapes\".[2]\n\nThe album contains lyrics about the couple's romantic love, lavish lifestyle, media worship, wealth, black pride and fame; themes that were found to be characteristic of the whole record.[13] Other songs feature the pair singing about their family affairs as well as maintaining their relationship following hardships (i.e. infidelity).[14] Time magazine's Maura Johnston regarded the album as another \"blockbuster duet in R&B and hip-hop\"; comparable to Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's soul songs from the 1960s and the 1995 Method Man and Mary J. Blige recording \"I'll Be There for You/You're All I Need to Get By\"; while incorporating contemporary elements in the form of trap beats, critical references to the National Football League and the Grammy Awards, and playing with \"public perceptions of the duo's relationship\".[8] Jenkins said it extolled African-American entrepreneurship while presenting Jay-Z as \"a doting father and husband, an entrepreneur and altruist with ideas about how everyone else should handle their businesses, a king-tier braggart, and a rap legend\".[11]\n\nArtwork [ edit ]\n\nFollowing the album release, the Louvre created a guided tour of the art displayed in the \"Apeshit\" music video. [ 15 ]\n\nThe artwork for the album is a still frame from the music video for \"Apeshit\". It features two of Beyonc\u00e9's background dancers, Jasmine Harper and Nicholas \"Slick\" Stewart, at the Louvre\u2014Harper is seen picking the hair of Stewart while standing in front of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa.[16]\n\nRelease and promotion [ edit ]\n\nThe surprise release of the album was announced during their On the Run II Tour concert in London\n\nOn June 6, 2018, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z embarked on the joint On the Run II Tour, a sequel to their 2014 On the Run Tour. At the end of their second show at London Stadium in London on June 16, 2018, Beyonc\u00e9 announced to the crowd that the duo had a surprise before leaving the stage. Then, the music video for \"Apeshit\" played on the LED video screen onstage. Following the conclusion of the video, the words \"ALBUM OUT NOW\" came across the screen. Everything Is Love was subsequently released exclusively via Jay-Z's streaming service Tidal and all audience members received a free six-month trial subscription in order to be able to stream the album.[17] The album was also made available for purchase on Tidal's online music store. The release was announced worldwide on Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's respective social media accounts with the artist of the album being monikered as the Carters.[13] On the same day, the music video for the album's second track and lead single, \"Apeshit\", was released on Beyonc\u00e9's official YouTube channel. It was directed by Ricky Saiz and filmed at the Louvre in Paris.[18][19]\n\nOn June 18, the album was made available across numerous other platforms, including iTunes Store, Apple Music, Deezer, Amazon Music, Napster, Google Play Music and Spotify.[20]\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nEverything is Love received positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, the album has an average score of 80 out of 100, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\" based on 22 reviews.[22]\n\nReviewing the album for The New York Times, Joe Coscarelli said it \"completes the Knowles-Carter conceptual trilogy\"\u2014referring to the previous releases of Lemonade and 4:44\u2014\"in an expert, tactical showing of family brand management\".[13] Music critic Nicholas Hautman of Us Weekly wrote: \"It's clear from the very first listen that Beyonc\u00e9 outshines her husband on much of the record, which really should have been marketed as 'Beyonc\u00e9 featuring Jay-Z' rather than 'Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z' (or 'the Carters', in this case). His verses are few and far between in comparison to hers, but it still somehow feels like a balanced body of work from two of the greatest artists of our time.\"[32] In The Guardian, Petridis believed the album retreads braggadocio centering around the duo's wealth and excellence, with less musical daring, but still does so with likeable music, genuine wit, and energy.[6] As per The Daily Telegraph music critic Neil McCormick pointed, \"Everything Is Love certainly doesn\u2019t have the musical expansiveness of Lemonade. There are neither ballads nor bangers, and not much in the way of melodic song construction at all. Rather, these are snappily repetitive beats on which the stars can put across their message as a form of hip hop conversation.\"[25] For Variety, Jim Aswad described it as \"solid and generally satisfying, but not the best from either.\"[33]\n\nWill Hodgkinson of The Times reviewed track-by-track, stated: \"Jay-Z is as dynamic as ever and the new, though Beyonc\u00e9 demands attention on this surprise album, [...] despite the ups and downs detailed on Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade and Jay-Z's subsequent mea culpa 4:44. Instead they are coming out fighting, with all that fame and money making them defensive, even paranoid, while a mix of classic soul, hard-hitting hip-hop and slinky R&B.\"[31] Pitchfork contributor Briana Younger wrote that the album \"is a compromise between the spoils of Lemonade's war and the fruits of 4:44's labor\", and that \"within this complex, messy and beautifully black display, the Carters find absolution.\"[29] Giving the album one and a half stars, Adam Rothbarth of Tiny Mix Tapes stated that everything about the album \"feels superficial, from the artists' constant pronouncement of their love for each other to their engagement with topics like fashion\". He also added that the \"most boring aspect of the album is its centerpiece: the couple's obsession with their wealth\".[34]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nDecade-end list Publication List Rank Year Source Cleveland.com 100 Greatest Albums of the 2010s 86 2019 [ 45 ]\n\nCommercial performance [ edit ]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z performing at the tour.\n\nEverything is Love debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart, earning 123,000 album-equivalent units, (including 70,000 copies as pure album sales) in its first week.[52] The album debuted on the chart after less than six full days of activity on Tidal, and four days of activity on all other digital retailers and streaming services.[53] In its second week, the album dropped to number four on the chart, earning an additional 59,000 units.[54] In its third week, the album dropped to number eight on the chart, earning 33,000 more units.[55] In its fourth week, the album remained at number eight on the chart, earning 29,000 units.[56] In 2018, Everything is Love was ranked as the 70th-best-performing album of the year on the Billboard 200.[57] On January 14, 2019, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 500,000 units in the United States.[58]\n\nTrack listing [ edit ]\n\nChopNotSlop Remix [ 62 ] No. Title Length 1. \"Summer\" 7:29 2. \"Boss\" 6:59 3. \"Black Effect\" 5:43 4. \"Friends\" 8:23 5. \"LoveHappy\" 5:15 6. \"Apeshit\" 6:05 7. \"713\" 5:50 8. \"Salud!\" 5:27 9. \"Nice\" 5:58 10. \"Heard About Us\" 5:53 Total length: 63 : 02\n\nAll tracks noted as \"ChopNotSlop Remix\" and credited to, The Carters, OG Ron C, Slim K and DJ Candlestick\n\nNotes\n\n^[a] Simon Mavin is incorrectly credited as Simon Marvin\n\nSimon Mavin is incorrectly credited as Simon Marvin ^[b] Jun Kozuki is incorrectly credited as Jan Kozuki\n\nSample credits\n\nPersonnel [ edit ]\n\nCredits adapted from Beyonc\u00e9's official website,[63] Tidal[64] and the album's liner notes.[60] \"Salud!\" is track 10.\n\nMusicians [ edit ]\n\nTechnical [ edit ]\n\nTyler Scott \u2013 string engineering (track 1) , recording (tracks 1, 4) , assistant mix engineering (tracks 1, 3, 10)\n\n, recording , assistant mix engineering Stuart White \u2013 recording (all tracks) ;
