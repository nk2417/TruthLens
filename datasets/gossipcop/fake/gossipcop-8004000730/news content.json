He\u2019s 10 times worse than what you see.\u201d\n\nStanulis, 42, who only worked for West for two weeks, recalled a career\u2019s worth of West\u2019s diva antics.\n\n\u201cI was told, \u2018Don\u2019t expect to last long. He goes through a lot of guys and some don\u2019t even last the first hour\u2019.\u201d\n\nOn his very first day, Stanulis got a taste of West\u2019s pampered antics.\n\n\u201cWe headed to his music studio. When we got into the elevator Kanye just stood there with his arms folded and said, \u2018Aren\u2019t you going to press the button?\u2019\u201d\n\nStanulis explained he didn\u2019t know which floor.\n\n\u201c[Kanye] flipped out, squealing that his time was precious and that he couldn\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t called ahead to find out which floor he worked on.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was amazed by the amount of bizarre behavior I saw in just two weeks,\u201d said Stanulis. \u201cIt is his world and everyone just exists within it. I don\u2019t know how Kim [Kardashian] stays married to him.\u201d\n\nAlmost anything could set the erratic rapper off.\n\n\u201cHe got annoyed because I \u2018got in his shot\u2019 once when the paparazzi were taking pictures,\u201d Stanulis said.\n\nStanulis also recalled being sent out to retrieve West after \u201cThe Life of Pablo\u201d MC stormed out of his music studio in a rage.\n\nThe bodyguard used his personal car \u2014 and West balked at having to maneuver past the childrens\u2019 car seats in the rear of the vehicle.\n\n\u201cI told him he could get in or keep on walking \u2014 and after a sulk he climbed in the front.\u201d\n\nWest also ordered Stanulis to never speak to his wife, after spotting the guard introducing himself to her in New York. He fired Stanulis on the night of the Met Gala, earlier this month, when he saw Stanulis standing in a hallway with Kardashian.\n\n\u201cHe is the most condescending person I have ever met,\u201d Stanulis said.", "images": ["https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/02/463790166.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/02/kanye2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=171&h=114&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115743727.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115485559.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/stranger-things-ted-wheeler-weighs-115738559.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fbethenny-frankels-gift-picks-include-115619188.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115742458.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115672489.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/fergie.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115727621.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115733621.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/minka-kelly-jenna-bush-hager.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115723827.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/02/463790166.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115731438.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2FCMA.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115734076.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/02/463790166.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2016/05/23/could-kanye-west-be-even-crazier-than-we-think/", "title": "Kanye West\u2019s ex-bodyguard reveals his crazy demands", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
