But, it appears the Hollywood exes are far from friendly, with In Touch and Star magazine claiming the divorce has turned nasty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Touch\u2019s explosive report claims that both Jen and Justin are incredibly hurt by their split, and the resentment is only growing as details of their troubled two-and-a-half year married leaks to the world.\n\n\u2018Both sides want their version of the truth out there,\u2019 a source who claims to know both parties tells In Touch. \u2018So it\u2019s getting nasty.\u2019\n\nThe insider adds, \u2018While they\u2019re pretending they\u2019re still friends, they are clashing behind the scenes.\u2019\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTensions between the couple began to mount when Justin accused Jen\u2019s Hollywood friends of leaking stories about the high-profile couple, In Touch\u2019s sensational report claims.\n\n\u2018Justin definitely thinks Jen\u2019s Hollywood friends are leaking stories to the media to make him look like he\u2019s the bad guy,\u2019 a source tells the publication. \u2018Meanwhile, Jen and her pals are positive that Justin\u2019s friends are doing the same.\u2019\n\nIn Touch further reports that the couple\u2019s inner circle have been forced to pick sides, leaving their friends torn and frustrated.\n\nA friend of the couple\u2019s tells the publication that Courtney Cox, Jason Bateman and his wife Amanda Anka are firmly \u2018Team Jen\u2019, while Ben Stiller and Paul Rudd have aligned themselves with Justin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis source of tension has made matters worse between the pair, with an insider revealing to In Touch, \u2018There is just so much animosity between them.\u2019\n\nStar magazine has also reported that Justin was sick of Jen\u2019s lavish lifestyle.\n\nAn insider close to the actor reveals that he is \u2018totally done pretending to be someone he\u2019s not and honestly feels relieved.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe magazine details how Jen and Justin\u2019s inability to find a balance between their careers and personalities ultimately led the pair\u2019s relationship to crumble.\n\n\u2018Justin always felt like he was the one doing all the compromising, and realised that he was creating a future he didn\u2019t actually want,\u2019 a friend tells Star. \u2018Now, finally, he\u2019s taking some time for himself, reconnecting with old friends and getting back to the way things were.\u2019\n\nNeither Jen or Justin have responded to In Touch or Star\u2019s reports.\n\nAdvertisement", "images":
