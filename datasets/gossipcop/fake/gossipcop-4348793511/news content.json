The Queen has blessed us again. One month after giving birth to twins in Los Angeles, a boy and a girl, Queen Bey posted the first official photo of them to Instagram early Friday morning. Beyhold, the world has finally been introduced to Sir and Rumi Carter.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 unveiled the family portrait on the twin's one-month birthday with the caption.\n\n\"Sir Carter and Rumi 1 month today. ??\u2764\ufe0f??????????\"\n\nThe image of Bey holding the precious babies received over 1 million likes within 30 minutes of the unveiling.\n\nWhile we had a hint about the twins names last month when it was reported the music superstar filed trademark documents with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office the confirmation from Queen Bey, no less, had the BeyHive in a frenzy.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 didn't stop there. The new mother of three also shared some pics of her killer snapback.\n\nShe also shared an adorable photo of her and hubby JAY-Z.\n\nWe are not worthy of all this amazingness.
