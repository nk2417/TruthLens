Two years after his ex-girlfriend Kristen Stewart cheated on him, Robert Pattinson showed that he was long over the scandal by laughing it off in an interview for the September 2014 issue of Esquire UK.\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Kristen cheats on Rob \u2014 see the crazy pics!

And honestly, who gives a s\u2014?\"\n\nThe British actor's latest comments come two years after Us Weekly exclusively revealed Stewart's fling with her married Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders in shocking pics published in July 2012.\n\n\"The hardest part was talking about it afterwards,\" Pattinson said of the affair. \"Because when you talk about other people, it affects them in ways you can't predict.\" (When the cheating news broke, Stewart released a public apology to Pattinson, stating: \"This momentary indiscretion has jeopardized the most important thing in my life, the person I love and respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry.\" After spending nearly a year of attempting to repair their relationship, the Twilight costars ultimately split last May.)\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Kristen\u2019s long road to infidelity Fairy tale beginnings?

But whenever I see a bunch of paparazzi hanging out, I always think, 'Oh God, what have they found out!' Oh, that love child! I totally forgot!\"\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Rob and Kristen\u2019s crazy year after scandal After attending Paris Fashion Week as the newest spokeswoman for Balenciagai in March 2012, Kristen Stewart met up with boyfriend Robert Pattinson for a romantic diner out in Paris, France.

The first time he processed his fame was one night out in L.A. \"I remember when it happened,\" he told the mag. \"I was going to clubs in L.A. and you had to call the promoters ahead of time to get on the guest list. But one time I forgot to call, and I was on the list anyway. That's when I knew. I showed up with mustard down my T-shirt and they're like giving me the wink, 'Yeah, man, you're on the list.'\"", "images":
