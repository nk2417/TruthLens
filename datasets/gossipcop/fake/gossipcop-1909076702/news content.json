For his name, the couple decided to look at the royal family tree for inspiration: Archie is derived from Arthur, which happens to be one of Prince Charles's names.\n\nThe royals have a long history of picking names that pay homage to family members. For example, Prince William and Kate Middleton welcomed their third child Prince Louis Arthur Charles to the family last spring. The names don't exactly fit in with the Emmas and Liams in most nurseries these days, but each pick has multiple ancestral namesakes. Louis (pronounced Lou-ee) pays tribute to Prince Philip's late uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten, who was also Prince Charles's beloved mentor and \"honorary grandfather.\" Arthur goes a long way back, both to the legendary king of Camelot as well as King George VI, the Queen's father, who had it as a middle name. Finally, Charles clearly pays homage to Prince Charles, Louis's grandfather. Uncle Prince Harry \u2014 who was born Henry Charles Albert David \u2014 also counts it as part of his name too.\n\nThat said, a few royals have bucked tradition. Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York (a.k.a. Fergie) stunned the public when they announced Princess Eugenie's name on March 30, 1990. Bookmakers William Hill told the Los Angeles Times that they had taken thousands of bets but not a single one for Eugenie (pronounced YOO-jen-ee). Princess Anne's daughter Zara Tindall (n\u00e9e Phillips) also has an untraditional name apparently suggested by Prince Charles.\n\nCheck out every regal moniker in the book with this list of the royal family's full names:\n\nThe Queen's Immediate Family\n\nFox Photos/Hulton Archive // Getty Images (From left to right) Princess Margaret, Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother), Princess
