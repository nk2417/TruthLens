All the hurt feelings and resentment she\u2019d suppressed for years came flooding to the surface, and she broke down in tears,\u201d the source revealed.\n\n\u201cHe apologised to Jen for being an absentee husband, for being stoned and bored much of the time. He also made amends for leaving her for Angelina.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s thought the former couple have now reached a \u2018level of closeness\u2019 they never thought possible following their bitter split in 2005.\n\nBrad and Jennifer were married for five years before he met Angelina and went on to marry and have children with her.\n\nAt the time of the split, Jennifer told Vanity Fair magazine: \u201cI\u2019m a human being, having a human experience in front of the world. I wish it weren\u2019t in front of the world. I try really hard to rise above it.\n\n\u201cI have to think there\u2019s some reason I have called this into my life. I have to believe that \u2013 otherwise it\u2019s just cruel.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cAm I lonely? Yes. Am I upset? Yes. Am I confused? Yes. Do I have my days when I\u2019ve thrown a little pity party for myself? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nJennifer has since married the actor and screenwriter Justin Theroux, 45, tying-the-knot in 2015 after four years of dating.\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220.\n\nWe pay for videos too.
