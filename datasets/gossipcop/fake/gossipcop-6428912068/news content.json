She is an amazing mother.\u201d\n\nHollywood\u2019s Ugliest Divorces\n\nIt\u2019s a description she\u2019s worked hard to achieve. Following her highly publicized breakdown in 2007, the pop star, now 36, was placed under dad Jamie\u2019s conservatorship and full custody of her kids was handed to Federline. Still, \u201cKevin has always allowed for very liberal visitation,\u201d says the insider. \u201cHe has been supportive of her recovery.\u201d\n\nDinner in Hawaii. Literally the best! A post shared by Britney Spears (@britneyspears) on Apr 13, 2017 at 1:12pm PDT\n\nAs her health improved, so did her parenting. (Today, she and Federline split time 50/50.) \u201cYes, she has her career,\u201d says the insider. \u201cBut her job as their mom is the most important role in her life.\u201d And Federline believes it has contributed to her professional gains. Says the source, \u201cKevin thinks her success is in part because the boys have been in her life.\u201d (After embarking on a world tour in July, she\u2019ll return to Vegas for a lucrative residency at the Park Theater.)\n\nStars At Court\n\nBut Spears is quick to see through her ex. As he has four other kids to support, \u201cBritney feels as if she is paying for them also,\u201d the insider says. \u201cHis rapping and DJ\u2019ing don\u2019t pay the bills.\u201d And neither will Spears \u2014 or her dad. \u201cJamie isn\u2019t going to meet an outrageous demand,\u201d says the source. \u201cHe knows how important the kids are to Britney and won\u2019t allow her to lose them. Jamie has assured her this won\u2019t become an issue.\u201d\n\nFor more on Spears and Federline, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now.", "images":
