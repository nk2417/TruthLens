Borris is also the location of one of Ireland\u2019s most successful arts festivals, the Borris House Festival of Writing and Ideas, which this year included speakers such as Margaret Atwood, Cillian Murphy, Led Zeppelin\u2019s John Paul Jones and Bob Geldof.\n\nHolmes is believed to have flown to Ireland from Paris where she was spotted last week, and stayed the night in one of the house\u2019s opulent bedrooms with stunning views over the Irish countryside.\n\nHolmes was also spotted in the nearby town of Kilkenny.\n\nHolmes and Foxx kept their relationship secret for several years, prompting speculation that Tom Cruise had \u2018banned\u2019 Holmes from dating for five years after the split as part of their divorce settlement.", "images":
