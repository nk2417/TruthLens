However, she has kept the rumored news on the down-low.\n\nDuring the process of trying to get pregnant, Stefani resorted to in-vitro fertilization and after being forced to take a number of fertility drugs, she was reportedly left exhausted, both physically and emotionally.\n\n\u201cGwen is 48 and was very insecure about not being able to give Blake a baby,\u201d a friend claimed. \u201cShe knows that would never be a problem for his ex Miranda Lambert because she\u2019s only 34!\"\n\nAlthough Stefani is said to be understandably disappointed by the news of her alleged miscarriage, she hasn't given up on getting pregnant, according to the report, and is up to take on the in-vitro fertilization process in the future.\n\nIn addition to the heartbreak they reportedly suffered to due Stefani's alleged miscarriage, Shelton has reportedly faced even more heartbreak after Stefani reportedly decided to put their wedding plans on hold.\n\nNews of Stefani's alleged miscarriage and plans to put her wedding to Shelton on hold come just months after a source told Hollywood Life that the couple, who often stars alongside one another on The Voice, was considering eloping.\n\n\u201cThey know that is going to be a big deal when they finally get themselves married,\u201d a source told the outlet in November. \u201cSo much so that they are considering just eloping and then having a big party to celebrate with friends and family.\"\n\nThe insider said that Stefani and Shelton are completely in love and will continue to be in love whether they have a big wedding or not. In addition, they have both already been married before and didn't feel that an elaborate ceremony was necessary.", "images": ["https://d.enstarz.com/en/full/228547/meghan-wasnt-love-weak-prince-harry-queens-cousin-warned-royal-stability-threat.jpg?w=80&f=5d67988b8c0aaac4fd1e7a42630effc3", "https://d.enstarz.com/en/full/229479/angelina-jolie.jpg?w=80&f=20787de7568fdc256a92af2ec2c17d8c", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-TV6FPprf929VL.gif", "https://d.enstarz.com/en/full/223991/porsha-williams.jpg?w=80&f=19a5d11cef43f070b7e47a0b3d41222d", "https://g.enstarz.com/themes/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://d.enstarz.com/en/full/229430/sarah-ferguson-loses-patron-role-after-calling-jeffrey-epstein.jpg?w=80&f=02278a04477512b46d22bd523e0ba446", "https://d.enstarz.com/en/full/204021/rhobh-erika-jayne-silent-ex-tom-girardi-fakes-visit-nursing-home-this-planned-amid.jpg?w=80&f=8d7b0919d48d12f98214cf8285193b00", "https://d.enstarz.com/en/full/230071/ozzy-osbournes-farewell-show-turns-engagement-party-daughter.jpg?w=80&f=a4209d789eba573ddd7460f3eccdcb89", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=14401431&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://g.enstarz.com/themes/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Cronin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.enstarz.com/articles/202818/20180210/gwen-stefani-allegedly-suffered-a-miscarriage-with-blake-sheltons-baby.htm", "title": "Gwen Stefani Allegedly Suffered A Miscarriage With Blake Shelton's Baby", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "news_keywords": "Celebrities,Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton", "description": "Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton reportedly conceived their first child together recently.
