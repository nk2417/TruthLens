Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and her friend Emma Grede\u2019s fashion line, Good American, isn\u2019t only a treasure trove of great denim, but of athleisure you\u2019ll feel cute [\u2026]\n\nThe pair, who welcomed daughter True on April 12, were seen walking into the celebration for their pal Savas, a.k.a Rich Youngin, in Cleveland. In photos posted by the Daily Mail, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star, 33, could be seen wearing black pants and a black long-sleeve top, over-the-knee boots, a Panama hat and large hoop earrings, the Cleveland Cavaliers player, 27, was dressed down in a blue and grey tracksuit and baseball cap.\n\nE! News reports that Kardashian threw the party for their friend at the Marble Room and the group of about a dozen people celebrated over dinner in a private room.\n\nBoth the Good American designer and Thompson shared videos on their Instagram Stories of Savas being presented with a birthday cake decorated with a shirtless photo of him, while another video posted on Instagram showed them standing together at the celebration.\n\nRelated: Biggest Celebrity Cheating Scandals Ever!
