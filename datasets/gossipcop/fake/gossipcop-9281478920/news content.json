Every day she spent with Ben out in the world for people to see felt like another day of public scrutiny, but her love for Ben was worth it. They both learned to stick by each other during those painful months.\u201d\n\nThe source adds that \u201cBen has worked incredibly hard on his sobriety and Lindsay has been his rock.
