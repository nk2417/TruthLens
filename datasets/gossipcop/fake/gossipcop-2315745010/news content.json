Ultimately, he just wants the best for his ex, especially in terms of her health. \u201cWilmer wants Demi to be healthy,\u201d the insider says, explaining, \u201cHe wants his friend to live a successful and healthy life.\u201d \u2014 \u201cA relationship further than that is not something Wilmer is interested in pursuing right now. Its just not the time to think about anything like that. The matter of Demi getting better and on the right path is everything that is on Wilmer\u2019s mind. Not romance.\u201d\n\nDemi was allegedly found unconscious after a drug overdose inside her Hollywood Hills home after a night of heavy partying with friends on Tuesday, July 24. A friend inside her home called 911, pleading with the dispatcher that they needed to get help as soon as possible. Demi reportedly received Narcan, a lifesaving drug, which counteracts opioids.However, it\u2019s unclear which drug(s) she took. After being admitted to the hospital, Demi\u2019s rep confirmed to HollywoodLife that she was \u201cawake and with her family.\u201d The rep also confirmed that some of the information being reported is \u201cincorrect.\u201d It was originally reported that Demi allegedly overdosed on heroin, however, the report was retracted.\n\nDemi has since agreed to enter rehab, which is where she will travel to when she is released from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in LA. The singer later released a statement on Instagram on August 6, which read in part: \u201cI want to thank God for keeping me alive and well. To my fans, I am forever grateful for all of your love and support throughout this past week and beyond. Your positive thoughts and prayers have helped me navigate through this difficult time.\u201d Just one month before her overdose, Demi released a new song titled \u201cSober,\u201d in which she admitted she was no longer sober from drugs and alcohol after six years.\n\nDemi was on tour amidst her overdose. The singer has since canceled the rest of her \u201cTell Me You Love Me Tour,\u201d to seek treatment.", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/does-wilmer-valderrama-really-want-to-marry-demi-lovato-ftr.jpg?resize=384%2C216", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/does-wilmer-valderrama-really-want-to-marry-demi-lovato-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C349", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/demi-lovato-wilmer-valderrama-pics-01.jpg?fit=290%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/demi-lovato-wilmer-valderrama-pics-04.jpg?fit=307%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/demi-lovato-wilmer-valderrama-pics-06.jpg?fit=313%2C440"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/does-wilmer-valderrama-really-want-to-marry-demi-lovato-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C349", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/08/09/wilmer-valderrama-demi-lovato-engagement-rumors-overdose-marriage-proposal-truth/", "title": "Does Wilmer Valderrama Really Want To Marry Demi Lovato After Her Overdose? \u2014 The Truth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "After a wild report claimed Wilmer Valderrama was longing to marry his ex Demi Lovato following her overdose, fans went wild about a potential engagement!
