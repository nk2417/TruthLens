I didn\u2019t want y\u2019all to call me fat so I got liposuction, right, and they gave me opioids, right, and I started taking two of them and then driving to work on the opioids, right?\u201d\n\nBefore he recounted a conversation he had with an assistant or someone in his entourage, \u201cThen my boy, and I\u2019d always ask my boy you know, to hand me\u2014we on tour, give me some weed, blah blah blah, so he had to go give me the opioids and there was talk amongst my camp, \u2018yeah he\u2019s popping, yeah he\u2019s popping pills\u2019 right? So when he handed it to me, he said, \u2018Mr. Ye, you know this is used to kill genius, right?\u2019 So I didn\u2019t take it. Two days later, I\u2019m in the hospital. I was taking two pills a day at that time.\u201d\n\nKanye was, of course, talking about his Pablo tour, which was cut short November 2016 due to his hospitalization.\n\nWe\u2019re glad he has worked on his issues and is in a better place now.
