( Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images for AMC)\n\nAMC announced several additions to its upcoming \u201cVisionaries\u201d docu-series Saturday at the Television Critics Assn. summer press tour in Beverly Hills.\n\nWriter-director-actor Eli Roth (\u201cCabin Fever,\u201d \u201cHostel\u201d) will be offering a deeper look into his signature style of genre filmmaking with \u201cEli Roth\u2019s History of Horror\u201d (working title) and Ahmir \u201cQuestlove\u201d Thompson, Tariq \u201cBlack Thought\u201d Trotter (founding members of The Roots) and Alex Gibney (\u2018Going Clear,\u201d \u201cHistory of the Eagles\u201d) will executive produce a series called \u201cRap Yearbook\u201d (another working title). The cable network also has three other installments in development: \u201cHistory of Video Games,\u201d \u201cOutlaws of the Internet,\u201d and \u201cHistory of Martial Arts.\u201d\n\nThe new \u201cVisionaries\u201d members join the previously announced programs \u201cRobert Kirkman\u2019s Secret History of Comics\u201d and \u201cJames Cameron\u2019s Story of Science Fiction.\u201d\n\nKirkman and Roth were present at the AMC panel with Cameron appearing via satellite to show sneak peeks from the comics and sci-fi iterations of the series.\n\nA sizzle reel for the \u201cSecret History of Comics\u201d utilized plenty of classic panel pages and a sort of motion comic-like animation to illustrate the early days of Marvel Comics, going all the way back to the Stan Lee and Jack Kirby days. But the real treat was a collection of cameos, famous faces opining about their love of the form including Lee himself, J.K. Simmons, Kevin Smith, and Method Man, who earnestly revealed, \u201cYou have to be born a comic book fan, I think.\u201d And there are plenty more talking heads to come, the AMC press release promised Patty Jenkins, Lynda Carter, Famke Janssen, Michelle Rodriguez, and Todd McFarlane.\n\nThe second clip shared a look at Cameron\u2019s love letter to science fiction. \u201cToday, science fiction is mainstream but it didn\u2019t used to be that way,\u201d the director explained. \u201cWhen I was a kid science fiction wasn\u2019t cool, but I thought it was cool.\u201d Cameron wants to focus on closing the gap between current fans\u2019 knowledge of modern day sci-fi to the pioneering works of literature that inspired the blockbuster offerings of today. The \u201cTerminator\u201d and \u201cAvatar\u201d director noted that without Jules Verne and H.G. Wells there would be no Avengers, \u201cStar Wars\u201d or his own works. The series will be divided by theme -- space travel, time travel etc.-- and include appearances from Paul W. Anderson, Roland Emmerich, Paul Verhoeven, Bryan Singer, Keanu Reeves, Jonathan Nolan, David Gerrold and D.C. Fontana.\n\nWhen asked how their respective series would showcase diversity -- the footage screened was very male-centric -- Kirkman responded that \u201cHistory of Comics\u201d would have two episodes devoted to diversity. One will focus on the women who helped Wonder Woman creator William Moulton Marston steer the course of the hugely famous female superhero, and another highlighting people of color titled \u201cThe Color of Comics.\u201d\n\nThe episode \u201cexplores the history of black characters, and the lack of black characters in the comic book industry,\u201d said Kirkman. \u201cwhich touches on the creation of Black Panther \u2014 the Marvel character \u2014 and does a really cool focus on this company called Milestone Comics that was founded by a group of African American comic book creators to create characters that appealed to them and represented them, because there was a huge lack of representation in comics even in the \u201890s.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have horror without Mary Shelley and \u2018Frankenstein,\u2019\u201d Roth added. He cited the late George Romero as an example of how he wants to break down the themes within the horror genre. \u201cAt the height of the civil rights movement [Romero] puts an African American as the lead of \u2018Night of the Living Dead\u2019 and at the end of the movie he\u2019s shot by a bunch of rednecks. Not because of the color of his skin, but because they think he\u2019s a zombie. But you can read into the implications of that. What [Romero] was doing with using genre to explore racism was so ahead of its time. it\u2019s just as potent today as it was 50 years ago. It\u2019s absolutely something we\u2019re going to be discussing.\u201d\n\nRoth\u2019s urgency to document the horror masters was apparent. It was the death of \u201cScream\u201d moviemaker Wes Craven that inspired Roth to get involved in \u201cVisionaries.\u201d\n\nThe panel then took a turn for the analytical when the creators were asked how their series would reflect the world today.\n\n\u201cThe fact that dystopian science fiction has come back, especially in television and in movies, is very important,\u201d said Cameron. \u201cIt means that in the age that we live in right now the challenges that face us are technological. They\u2019re science challenges: climate change, genetics, artificial intelligence, things like that. These are really on our horizon as major, existential threats.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best horror reflects what\u2019s going on in our times,\u201d said Roth. He used Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out\u201d \u2014 which addressed modern day racial tensions\u2014 as a reference. \u201cIt\u2019s no accident that movie coming out right now is making over $200 million at the box office. You can tell it\u2019s really resonating with people.\u201d\n\nBouncing off Cameron\u2019s dystopia revelation, Roth then turned his lens onto the current political climate, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen a cast of characters like this in our White House that\u2019s straight out of WWF wrestling in the \u201880s. When [Anthony Scaramucci] is coming out with things that would make \u2018Rowdy\u2019 Roddy Piper in his heyday blush. This is a farce, is this actually happening?\u201d\n\nWhen will we start seeing this dystopian outlook on the current political climate in the movies? Possibly before Roth\u2019s series, which will air sometime in 2018, after \u201cHistory of Comics\u201d and the \u201cStory of Science Fiction\u201d in 2017.", "images":
