But it was Katie who decided to pull the plug entirely \u2014 and she told him they should just \u201ccancel altogether!\u201d UPDATE: A rep for Jamie has denied these reports, and says the singer was \u201cnever engaged.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything was going so well,\u201d the mag\u2019s insider claims. \u201cBut with this latest development, it\u2019s understandable that Katie would start to feel insecure about the relationship. And she definitely wouldn\u2019t want to raise another child on her own, as she\u2019s been forced to do with Suri since she left Tom [Cruise].\u201d\n\nKatie is reportedly four months pregnant with her and Jamie\u2019s baby girl, but according to the source, he plans on sticking by her, regardless of their relationship status.\n\n\u201cThey love each other and everyone says they are really good together,\u201d the insider explains. \u201cKatie just has to get over this stumbling block. It\u2019s the first real issue they\u2019ve had, and while it\u2019s a big one, it shouldn\u2019t be a deal breaker.\u201d This couple was first linked in 2013, although they\u2019ve both made it a point to keep their romantic relationship private.\n\nKatie and Jamie have both been spotted wearing matching gold bands on their wedding fingers in recent months, so it\u2019s been speculated that they\u2019ve actually already married in a low-key ceremony. Regardless of their official status, though, we just hope these two are happy!\n\nWatch Katie Holmes in the thrilling Miss Meadows here on iTunes!\n\nWhat do you think is going on in Katie and Jamie\u2019s relationship, HollywoodLifers?
