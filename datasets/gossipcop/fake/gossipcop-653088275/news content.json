The tweets came after Scarborough and Brzezinski criticized him on their MSNBC show, Brzezinski saying he had \"teensie\" hands and that he was \"lying every day and destroying the country.\"\n\nNEWS: Emma Thompson Says Donald Trump Asked Her Out Once -- 'I Didn't Know What to Do With Myself'\n\n\"I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore),\" Trump later tweeted. \"Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year's Eve, and insisted on joining me. She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!\"\n\nAnd it appears the feud is here to stay. Brzezinski tweeted a picture of a Cheerios box on Thursday, reading, \"Made For Little Hands.\"\n\nMelania Trump, who has said that cyberbullying will be one of the main focuses of her work as first lady, stood by her husband.\n\n\"As the first lady has stated publicly in the past, when her husband gets attacked, he will punch back 10 times harder,\" her communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement to CNN.\n\n\n\nA number of celebs have since responded in support of Brzezinski.\n\nNEWS: Kristen Stewart Opens Up About Being Shamed by President Donald Trump on Twitter\n\nEarlier this month, Kathy Griffin lost a number of gigs after taking part in a controversial photo shoot, in which she held up a bloodied replica of Trump's head. Griffin has since apologized for the photos, and burst into tears when asked by ET's Kevin Frazier at a press conference if she'd spoken with her former CNN New Year's Eve co-host, Anderson Cooper, after he condemned the photo shoot.\n\n\n\nWatch below:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2015-09/640_donald_trump_488668778.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2015-09/640_donald_trump_488668778.jpg?width=1024&quality=80"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2015-09/640_donald_trump_488668778.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220645_chrissy_teigen_and_more_celebs_slam_donald_trump_over_mika_brzezinski_facelift_tweet", "title": "Chrissy Teigen, Andy Cohen and More Celebs React to Donald Trump's Shocking Mika Brzezinski Tweets", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2015-09/640_donald_trump_488668778.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Chrissy Teigen, Andy Cohen and More Celebs React to Donald Trump's Shocking Mika Brzezinski Tweets", "title": "Chrissy Teigen, Andy Cohen and More Celebs React to Donald Trump's Shocking Mika Brzezinski Tweets", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220645_chrissy_teigen_and_more_celebs_slam_donald_trump_over_mika_brzezinski_facelift_tweet", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Chrissy Teigen, Andy Cohen and More Celebs React to Donald Trump's Shocking Mika Brzezinski Tweets", "twitter": {"description": "Chrissy Teigen, Andy Cohen and More Celebs React to Donald Trump's Shocking Mika Brzezinski Tweets", "title": "Chrissy Teigen, Andy Cohen and More Celebs React to Donald Trump's Shocking Mika Brzezinski Tweets", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220645_chrissy_teigen_and_more_celebs_slam_donald_trump_over_mika_brzezinski_facelift_tweet", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2015-09/640_donald_trump_488668778.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Chrissy Teigen, Andy Cohen and More Celebs React to Donald Trump's Shocking Mika Brzezinski Tweets | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, ,", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
