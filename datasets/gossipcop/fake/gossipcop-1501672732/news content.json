We do not even own a church building. So that gives you a little insight about how serious you can take his observations about anything to do with us.\u201d\n\nTrending Stories \u2018Faith Is Under Attack': Nicki Minaj Spreads Misleading Information at the United Nations D4vd Identified as Suspect in Death Investigation of Teen Girl Found in Tesla Neighbor Indicted in Murder of \u2018King of the Hill\u2019 Star Jonathan Joss Elon Musk Fires Back After Billie Eilish Calls Him a \u2018Coward\u2019 for Wealth Hoarding\n\nDespite the tension, Lentz added that he\u2019s still a Post Malone fan. \u201cHe is a very gifted artist,\u201d he said, \u201cand I wish him nothing but the best.\u201d\n\nIn Rolling Stone\u2018s original, wide-ranging story, a source close to Bieber also denied that he\u2019s donated $10 million. During the same conversation, Post Malone labeled the mega-church \u201ca total cult\u201d while praising the Purpose singer as a \u201cfucking awesome, great dude\u201d and \u201cgenuine friend.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/justin-bieber-post-malone-eb560c80-8ac4-4fd6-8ec0-c012dcdb52fd.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/justin-bieber-post-malone-eb560c80-8ac4-4fd6-8ec0-c012dcdb52fd.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Reed", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hillsong-church-pastor-refutes-post-malones-claims-about-justin-bieber-200471/", "title": "Hillsong Church Pastor Refutes Post Malone\u2019s Claims About Justin Bieber", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Pastor Carl Lentz of Hillsong New York City refuted Post Malone's claim that Justin Bieber has donated around $10 million to the church.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Ryan Reed", "tags": "Justin Bieber", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Hillsong Church Pastor Refutes Post Malone's Claims About Justin Bieber", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hillsong-church-pastor-refutes-post-malones-claims-about-justin-bieber-200471/", "description": "Pastor Carl Lentz of Hillsong New York City refuted Post Malone's claim that Justin Bieber has donated around $10 million to the church.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/justin-bieber-post-malone-eb560c80-8ac4-4fd6-8ec0-c012dcdb52fd.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "width": 1401, "height": 788, "alt": "Justin Bieber Post Malone Hillsong"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-06T18:36:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T15:12:05+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pastor Carl Lentz of Hillsong New York City refuted Post Malone's claim that Justin Bieber has donated around $10 million to the church.", "site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hillsong Church Pastor Refutes Post Malone\u2019s Claims About Justin Bieber", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/justin-bieber-post-malone-eb560c80-8ac4-4fd6-8ec0-c012dcdb52fd.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512585413.0, "source": "http://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
