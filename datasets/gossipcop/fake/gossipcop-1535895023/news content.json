However sources tell US magazine Life & Style that she has given up on ever having a child, and washed her hands of baby expectations \u2013 \u2018those put on her by society and fans, and those she put on herself\u2019.\n\nHaving once gushed in her twenties about wanting \u2018to be a young mom\u2019 to three, Jen has now completely come into her own. \u2018I feel better in my 40s,\u2019 she says. \u2018Not only do you feel better in your body physically, but you\u2019re mentally better.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn insider tells Life & Style, \u2018Jen loves her free-spirit life, being able to travel or get up and go whenever she wants, with no notice,\u2019 pointing out she\u2019s been to Berlin, Mexico and now Paris over the past six months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow Jen, who is godmum to Courteney Cox\u2019s daughter Coco, finds she gets her \u2018maternal\u2019 fill from her numerous projects and charity work with children\u2019s hospitals. \u2018You may not have a child come out of your vagina,\u2019 says Jen, \u2018but that doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t mothering \u2013 dogs, friends, friends\u2019 children.\u2019\n\nLoading the player...", "images":
