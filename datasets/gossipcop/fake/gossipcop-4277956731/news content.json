Kim Kardashian, 37, is reportedly at her wits end when it comes to dealing with husband Kanye West, 40. She\u2019s struggled since Kanye\u2019s terrifying November 2016 breakdown, and she reportedly can\u2019t see a light at the end of the tunnel, according to an insider who spoke to Star Magazine.\u201d\n\nPredicting a Kim-Kanye divorce is a cottage industry, as previous stories show:\n\nKim kardasian had many opportunities to divorce Kanye, she is trying extremely hard to make her marriage work.
