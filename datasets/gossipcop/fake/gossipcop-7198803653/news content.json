Or perhaps nothing at all?\n\nWell if you\u2019re an A-lister with the eyes of the world watching, it seems no length is too extreme to ensure your brows are perfect.\n\nAustralian eyebrow-artist to the stars Sharon-Lee Hamilton was flown from Sydney to Los Angeles to tend to a select few celebrities\u2019 brows before the 2017 Oscars.\n\nWe previously reported that Leonardo DiCaprio was one member of the Hollywood elite who flew Hamilton the 7,500 across the Pacific Ocean, but we have since learnt that this was incorrect.\n\nHamilton has previously revealed that when travelling on request, her costs are covered.\n\nSo with Hamilton\u2019s signature brow consultation costing $200 (\u00a3124) for men, it\u2019s safe to say the celebs will have paid a small fortune for their perfect Oscars brows.\n\nHamilton\u2019s website states that the treatment includes: \u201cA full face read, followed by an all-inclusive service that comprises any tints, stains or lightening required in conjunction with your full expert shaping.\n\n\u201cIncluded is an eyelash tint as well as a glycolic infused collagen eye treatment plus a full heated paraffin hand treatment followed by a light eye makeup application.\u201d\n\nGuests who visit Hamilton in one of her salons can enjoy a complimentary beverage including Champagne, wine and coffee.\n\nHowever it\u2019s likely that Champagne was not in short supply when Hollywood\u2019s elite were getting ready for the biggest night of the year.\n\nWhilst their outfits were critiqued to the nth degree, eyebrows suffered less scrutiny.\n\nHamilton has not revealed all the celebrities she treated before the Oscars, but her previous clients include Beyonc\u00e9, George Clooney, Kim Kardashian, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Serena Williams and Princess Mary of Denmark.", "images": ["http://www.independent.co.uk/img/logo-white-out.svg", "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/02/28/17/oscars.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/02/28/17/oscars.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/leonardo-dicaprio-eyebrow-artist-oscars-tobey-maguire-flight-la-a7601731.html", "title": "A-listers flew eyebrow artist 7,500 miles to do their brows for the Oscars", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "Fashion", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/life-style/fashion", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "That's a long way to go for the sake of eyebrows", "og": {"updated_time": "2017-03-03T08:30:50.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "A-listers flew an 'eyebrow artist' 7,500 miles to do their brows for the Oscars", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/life-style/fashion/leonardo-dicaprio-eyebrow-artist-oscars-tobey-maguire-flight-la-a7601731.html", "type": "article", "description": "That's a long way to go for the sake of eyebrows", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/02/28/17/oscars.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/02/28/17/oscars.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-03-03T08:30:50.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-03-03T08:30:50.000Z", "section": "Lifestyle", "subsection": "Fashion", "author_name": "Rachel Hosie", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 355, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 3, "video_count": 2, "internal_link_count": 0, "external_link_count": 1}, "date": "2017-03-03T08:30:50.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "A-listers flew an 'eyebrow artist' 7,500 miles to do their brows for the Oscars", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "That's a long way to go for the sake of eyebrows", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/02/28/17/oscars.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Oscars 2017\",\"eyebrows\",\"Celebrities\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488529850.0, "source": "http://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
