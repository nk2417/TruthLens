That's when she clued everyone watching into the fact that she's actually a pro at doing voices, and her fake baby voice is one that her boyfriend and her friends would rather her not do.\n\nWhy? you ask. Well, because her baby voice isn't cute and cuddly like in an episode of Peppa Pig. No, it's straightup terrifying. Like straight out of Chucky.\n\nCheck it out below and get ready to criiiiiiinge.\n\nAt least in Ariel's case, her fake voice skills pay off\u2026 literally. She gets paid big bucks to use them in movies, so more power to her!", "images":
