Fox News is still No. 1 among cable news networks in prime time, and the ratings for \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d have held steady while Gayle King and Norah O\u2019Donnell continue in Mr. Rose\u2019s absence. (CBS has not yet hired a replacement.)\n\nMs. Kotb cut her teeth as a local reporter and anchor, including a six-year stint for the CBS affiliate in New Orleans. She joined NBC in 1998 as a correspondent for \u201cDateline.\u201d\n\n\u201cOver the past several weeks, Hoda has seamlessly stepped into the co-anchor role alongside Savannah, and the two have quickly hit the ground running,\u201d said Andrew Lack, the chairman of NBC News, in an early morning memo to staff on Tuesday. \u201cThey have an undeniable connection with each other and, most importantly, with viewers, a hallmark of \u2018Today.\u2019 Hoda is, in a word, remarkable. She has the rare ability to share authentic and heartfelt moments in even the most difficult news circumstances.\u201d\n\nThough NBC wanted to alert its viewers first, the decision had been made for at least a week and one magazine interview had been arranged. Right at 7 a.m., as the on-air announcement was being made, People magazine released its cover for next week, featuring a smiling Ms. Kotb and Ms. Guthrie under the somewhat incongruous headline \u201cOur hearts were broken.\u201d (That referred to Mr. Lauer.) Both co-anchors were quoted by the magazine, discussing their excitement about the new NBC morning hour.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/world/03Today/03Today-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=297c70770273525fbb680bf29bfe310ecb347556a6f09b08ca692770bf8990bd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/30/business/30-Rutenberg-sub2/30-Rutenberg-sub2-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg?auto=webp&quality=30&disable=upscale&format=pjpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/world/03Today/merlin_130695032_9202f8df-6660-470a-8f0d-0660ca3ba186-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/03/world/03Today/03Today-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=297c70770273525fbb680bf29bfe310ecb347556a6f09b08ca692770bf8990bd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["John Koblin", "Prashant S.
