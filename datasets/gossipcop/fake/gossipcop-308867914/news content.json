Several students posted pictures of the actor posing with the class, including one where he is standing next to Oxman.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s genius and gorgeous,\u201d an architect, who has seen Oxman lecture and knows her work, tells PEOPLE.\n\nThe actor kept it casual in an all-black outfit as he happily smiled along with the students for several pictures. He also stood next to Oxman in another picture with his hands behind his back as the larger group beamed at the camera. That photo has since been taken down.\n\nPage Six first reported last week that the two had struck up a friendship based on their shared love of architecture. Pitt reportedly met Oxman, 42, through an architecture project at MIT, where she works as a professor of media arts and sciences at the school\u2019s Media Lab.\n\nThe duo connected over their shared love of design and architecture, a source told Page Six TV, adding that their relationship \u201cis best described as a professional friendship.\u201d While the source said the friendship is not romantic in nature, Pitt is \u201cinterested in spending more time\u201d with Oxman.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Brad Pitt Is \u2018in a Better Place\u2019 Amid Divorce Proceedings with Angelina Jolie: Source\n\nIn a 2017 interview with W Magazine, Oxman used Pitt and George Clooney as examples of the human tendency to idolize male icons. Oxman spoke out on the issue of male dominance and how it isn\u2019t specific to the architecture field.\n\n\u201cFor the same reason we have the Brad Pitts and the George Clooneys, it\u2019s just part of human nature to idolize stereotypes,\u201d she explained. \u201cSuch singularities are useful to the common perception of heroism. But it\u2019s not only true for architecture; it\u2019s true in musical composition, for females working in theater, for film directors. This isn\u2019t just a disease of the architecture profession; it\u2019s a phenotype of human culture and how we develop stereotypes and perceptions.\u201d\n\nLast year, a source told PEOPLE that Pitt has been \u201ccasually dating,\u201d adding, \u201cHe has been going out but there is nothing serious in the dating area at all, nothing to speak of at this point.", "images":
