It was released as the album's second single on May 16, 2018 by RCA Records, impacting hot adult contemporary radio and contemporary hit radio on June 19 and May 28, respectively. Aguilera co-wrote the song with Johnny Simpson, Mark Williams, Audra Mae, Raul Cubina and Jon Bellion, while the production was handled by the latter.\n\n\"Fall in Line\" is centered around lyrical themes of female empowerment, being recognized as a feminist anthem. The song received widespread acclaim from music critics, who commended Aguilera's and Lovato's vocals, as well as the lyrics and inspiring theme. Commercially, \"Fall in Line\" made minor impact on charts, but reached top-forty positions in Taiwan, Hungary and Guatemala, as well as the digital charts of Greece, Spain and the United States.\n\nFor promotion, an accompanying lyric video was uploaded onto Aguilera's official YouTube channel simultaneously with the song's release, followed by a music video directed by Luke Gilford. The singer also performed it on several occasions, including the Carpool Karaoke segment of The Late Late Show with James Corden, 2018 Billboard Music Awards, The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and Today Show. The song was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nAguilera described the song: \"I wrote 'Fall in Line' a few years ago before all this news came out [Time's Up and Me Too movement]. It was the song that needed to be heard. Because of what I witnessed when I was growing up I always felt really driven to have a voice that my mom kind of never had in my childhood. So I've always wanted to be that advocate for women and anybody that was struggling to have their own voice. I watched my mom have to be submissive, watch her Ps and Qs or she's gonna get beat up. You can either be, unfortunately, so damaged by it that you take a turn for the worse, or you can feel empowered by it and make choices to never go down that route.\"[1]\n\nIn June 2018, Aguilera appeared on DJ Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show, giving an interview about Liberation. The singer explained that the track was committed to everyone that felt disempowered, adding: \"It's a message that I've preached [...] I think the chorus can fit anybody's feeling if they feel repressed, or oppressed, or whatever's going on in their lives that they feel they need to come to their own realization\". Aguilera also revealed that she decided to work with Lovato because it was important to choose someone that is vocal about her own struggles and past, stating: \"I wanted somebody that could 'come to play'\", adding that she \"put so much heart and passion into it\" and teared up when first hearing her vocals on it. Aguilera also sent her flowers and mentioned \"I was just like, 'Oh my God, you took it to the next level'\".[2] Lovato also noted that, \"It\u2019s easy to say that Christina\u2019s legacy is her vocals, but for me it\u2019s been more than that. [...] Her legacy is teaching people to stay true to who they are.\"[3]\n\nRelease and promotion [ edit ]\n\n\"Fall in Line\" premiered on May 16, 2018, at 8 a.m. EST, and was released commercially for digital download worldwide at the same time.[4] Aguilera stated in a tweet: \"To anyone who's ever felt silenced and repressed, the truth seekers and bold thinkers...may you liberate your voice and break the mold, never back down, and never fall in line.\"[5]\n\nRecording [ edit ]\n\nAguilera co-wrote \"Fall in Line\" alongside Johnny Simpson, Mark Williams, Audra Mae, Jon Bellion, and Raul Cubina, while the production was handled by Jon Bellion.

Aguilera stated on Twitter, \"'Fall in Line' is as much about supporting each other as it is about self-empowerment. I wanted to convey that in this video by visually representing the imprisonment that so many of us have felt, and the freedom we can achieve together.\"[41] According to Billboard and Rolling Stone, \"The oppressive, male-dominated prison facility is a clear critique on society's oppression of women.\"[42][43] The video won a MTV Espa\u00f1a Award for Video of the Summer.[44]\n\nLive performances [ edit ]\n\nAguilera made the live performance debut of \"Fall in Line\" on Carpool Karaoke episode 471, which was first broadcast on May 16, 2018.[45][46] She performed the song with Lovato at the 2018 Billboard Music Awards four days later.[47] The song was also added to the set list of the European leg of Lovato's Tell Me You Love Me World Tour.[48] On 14 June, Aguilera performed \"Think\", \"Fighter\" and \"Fall in Line\" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.[49] The next day, she performed \"Can't Hold Us Down\", \"Fall in Line\" and \"Fighter\" on Today Show.[50] Aguilera also performed the song on her residency and tour, Christina Aguilera: The Xperience (2019\u20132020) and The X Tour (2019), respectively.\n\nCredits and personnel [ edit ]\n\nCredits were adapted from Liberation.[6]\n\nRecording and management [ edit ]\n\nPersonnel [ edit ]\n\nChristina Aguilera \u2013 vocals, songwriting\n\nDemi Lovato \u2013 vocals\n\nJon Bellion \u2013 songwriting, production, background vocals\n\nAudra Mae \u2013 songwriting, background vocals, additional vocals\n\nMark Williams \u2013 songwriting, co-production\n\nRaul Cubina \u2013 songwriting, co-production\n\nJonathan \"Johnny\" Simpson \u2013 songwriting, recording, co-production\n\nMitch Allan \u2013 Demi Lovato vocal production\n\nRyan Svendsen \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn\n\nOscar Ramirez \u2013 Christina Aguilera vocal engineering\n\nScott Robinson \u2013 additional vocal engineering\n\nManny Marroquin \u2013 mixing\n\nChris Galland \u2013 mix engineering\n\nRobin Florent \u2013 mix assistance\n\nScott Desmarais \u2013 mix assistance\n\nDave Kutch \u2013 mastering\n\nCharts [ edit ]\n\nRelease history [ edit ]", "images": ["http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/3f/Christina_Aguilera_Fall_in_Line.png/250px-Christina_Aguilera_Fall_in_Line.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/20px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/Christina_Aguilera_Fall_in_Line.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/Christina_Aguilera_Fall_in_Line.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_in_Line", "title": "Fall in Line", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/Christina_Aguilera_Fall_in_Line.png", "width": 1200, "height": 1200}, "title": "Fall in Line - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
