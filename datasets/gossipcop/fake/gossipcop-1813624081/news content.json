I don\u2019t need to \u2018punish\u2019 him because I\u2019m not getting back with him.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Thompson was reported to have moved two houses away from Kardashian in Hidden Hills, California, and was spotted paying regular visits to her home, spurring rumors of another reconciliation between the pair. \u201cIf you go to the house, he\u2019s always around,\u201d a source told OK! in April.\n\nIn this week\u2019s episode, Kardashian clarifies that the athlete\u2019s visits have been strictly to step in on parenting duties while she is away. \u201cI would rather him be here than the nanny,\u201d she explained, adding that she\u2019s been strict about not entertaining anything else. \u201cThere\u2019s still boundaries; I\u2019m definitely putting my foot down around a lot of things. No one\u2019s just here chilling if there\u2019s no kids involved.\u201d\n\nJerritt Clark // Getty Images\n\nThe pair\u2019s whirlwind, on-again, off-again relationship was first confirmed back in 2016. Since, the two have reportedly broken up multiple times amid several reports of the athlete\u2019s infidelity.\n\nIn recent months, sources have reported that Thompson has been wanting Kardashian back, though the sentiment doesn\u2019t seem to be reciprocated.\n\n\u201cTristan still loves Khlo\u00e9 and would love to be with her again,\u201d a source told Entertainment Tonight in April. \u201cHe\u2019s doing whatever he can to try to prove himself to Khlo\u00e9 and her family.\u201d\n\n\u201cTristan will always be in Khlo\u00e9\u2019s life, but she isn\u2019t in love with him,\u201d another insider told ET in March. \u201cShe chooses to be supportive, both publicly and privately, for the sake of their children.\u201d", "images":
