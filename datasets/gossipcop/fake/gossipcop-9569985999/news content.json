Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.\u201d\n\nThe sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein have also gotten the attention of the federal government.\n\nThe U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York has begun a criminal probe investigating in part whether he enticed or persuaded any women to cross state lines with the intent of committing a sex crime, which is potentially a federal offense, according to The Wall Street Journal, which was first to report the news.\n\nBrafman confirmed to PEOPLE that he has met with federal prosecutors in the SDNY \u201cin an attempt to dissuade them from proceeding\u201d and will continue to meet with them moving forward.\n\n\u201cMr. Weinstein has always maintained that he has never engaged in nonconsensual sexual acts,\u201d Brafman added.", "images":
