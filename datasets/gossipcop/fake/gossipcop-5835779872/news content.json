But even in the writing phase, women must contend with Hollywood conventions that women on-screen must be likable or cleave to Madonna-whore-catfight stereotypes. \u2018\u2018I\u2019ve had male executives say that my lead character was unlikable because she slept with a lot of guys,\u2019\u2019 says the director Julie Taymor. Liz Meriwether, the 34-year-old creator of Fox\u2019s \u2018\u2018New Girl,\u2019\u2019 says that before this show, she received notes from executives saying, \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t understand how this character can be smart and sexy.\u2019\u2019\n\nFemale writers in Hollywood told me they are used to hearing things like \u2018\u2018Can you insert a rape scene here?\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Can they go to a strip club here?\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018Can you rewrite the fat friend for Eva Mendes? She has high marks for foreign distribution.\u2019\u2019 They trade stories about how a schlubby male studio head mutters that he doesn\u2019t want to look at \u2018\u2018ugly actresses,\u2019\u2019 and how schlubby male directors, caught up in their fantasy world, choose one beautiful actress over another simply because she has a hair color that fits their customized sexual daydream. \u2018\u2018I still see storytelling for men by men that is always reinforcing the male gaze,\u2019\u2019 says Jill Soloway, the Emmy-winning creator of Amazon\u2019s \u2018\u2018Transparent,\u2019\u2019 which is based on her own parent, a trans woman played by Jeffrey Tambor. Karyn Kusama, who directed \u2018\u2018Girlfight\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018Jennifer\u2019s Body,\u2019\u2019 told me that \u2018\u2018the No. 1 script motif I read is a woman chained to a wall. It\u2019s almost de rigueur now. I look back nostalgically at slasher films. At least then, the girls were main characters in speaking roles.\u2019\u2019\n\nLena Dunham laments that, instead of creating space for women to tell stories they are naturally good at telling, the studios just keep trying to wedge them into narrow, clich\u00e9d concepts. After her debut feature, \u2018\u2018Tiny Furniture,\u2019\u2019 studio executives pitched her film ideas about a tooth fairy with an evil agenda and kids on a crazy holiday adventure. \u2018\u2018If you watch my movie,\u2019\u2019 she says, \u2018\u2018you understand I am perverse and weird and angry and not looking to direct a film that ends with a bunch of teenagers exploding into glitter.\u2019\u2019\n\nOn Oscar night, Meryl Streep leapt to applaud Patricia Arquette when she pleaded for equal pay for women. She followed up by funding a writing lab for Hollywood\u2019s untouchable caste, women screenwriters over 40. \u2018\u2018It\u2019s harder for men to imagine themselves as the girl in the movies than it is for me to imagine myself as Daniel Craig bringing down the building,\u2019\u2019 the \u2018\u2018Suffragette\u2019\u2019 star said, curled up on a couch in the Greenwich Hotel\u2019s restaurant in TriBeCa. \u2018\u2018Boys are never encouraged to imagine what it is like to be female. The reason I know this is because when I made \u2018The Devil Wears Prada,\u2019 it was the very first time men came to me after the film and said, \u2018I know how you felt.\u2019 \u2019\u2019",
