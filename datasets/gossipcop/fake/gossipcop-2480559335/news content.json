Taylor wore THAT scarf in THIS photo \u2014 and the music video has ex-love handing singer a SCARF!\n\nOne of the great mysteries of the modern age has been solved - the identity of the cad who inspired Taylor Swift\u2019s breakup ditty, \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\u201d\n\nThe ex who she used her axe to grind is reportedly actor Jake Gyllenahaal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely about Jake,\u201d a source told US Weekly.\n\nSpeculation over which unseemly ex-boyfriend \u2014 from a pool that included Joe Jonas, \u201cTwilight\u201d star Taylor Lautner, John Mayer and Gyllenhaal \u2014 inspired Taylor Swift\u2019s new breakup song has mounted since its release last month.\n\nJonas told Maryland\u2019s 94.7 Fresh FM immediately after the song was released that he\u2019s not the guy. \u201cI can say it\u2019s not about me, because I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever tried another time,\u201d Jonas told the radio station when prodded if he thought he was the former boyfriend referenced on \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\u201d\n\nAnd Mayer has already been the subject of a biting Swift song - the acerbic \u201cDear John.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt made me feel terrible. Because I didn\u2019t deserve it,\u201d Mayer told Rolling Stone magazine. \u201cI\u2019m pretty good at taking accountability now, and I never did anything to deserve that. It was a really lousy thing for her to do.\u201d\n\nThe country singer herself didn\u2019t spill the beans during an interview on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d Tuesday morning. But she did shed some light on the origin of the song.\n\n\u201cThis guy walks in who is a friend of my ex\u2019s and starts talking about how he\u2019s heard we\u2019re going to get back together. And that was not the case,\u201d Swift told GMA. \u201cSo I start telling them the story: break up, get back together, break up, get back together \u2014 just, ugh, the worst! And I picked up the guitar and (songwriting partner Max Martin) said, \u2018This is what we\u2019re writing.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut other clues also pointed to Gyllenhaal, according The Huffington Post.\n\nThe actor playing the inconsiderate ex-love interest gives Swift a scarf in the video for \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.\u201d The singer was photographed wearing Gyllenhaal\u2019s scarf while they dated.\n\nPlus Swift and Gyllenhaal actually did briefly and unsuccessfully try to get back together. In January 2011, the off-again, off-again couple pair were photographed on a dinner date \u2014Taylor Swift and Jake Gyllenhaal after their breakup a few days earlier.\n\nThe track will be on her next album, \u201cRed,\u201d which lands on Oct. 22.\n\nESacks@nydailynews.com", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20120908025625im_/http://www.nydailynews.com/nydn/img/static/logo/inform.jpg",
