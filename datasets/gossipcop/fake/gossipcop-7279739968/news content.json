But days later, Disick denied they had ever broken up.\n\nFrom their first flirtations to their recent split, here\u2019s a complete timeline of their relationship.\n\nSummer Love\n\nDisick was first seen cuddling with the daughter of Lionel Richie aboard a yacht in Cannes in May 2017, when she was 18. At the time, Sofia denied any romance, tweeting, \u201cJust so everyone can get their panties out of their a\u2014es, Scott and I are just homies,\u201d adding the hashtag #relax.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Sofia seems smitten.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious she looks up to Scott,\u201d said another source. \u201cShe constantly giggles around him. They are very flirty. Scott takes care of her, opens the car door and pays for everything.\u201d\n\nInstagram Official\n\nThe two made things official on Instagram days later, when videos surfaced of the two sharing a kiss and receiving a \u201ccongratulations\u201d cake during a trip to Miami.\n\nAlec Monopoly/Instagram\n\nScott Disick/Instagram\n\nAround the World\n\nThe two grew closer as they began to travel together, taking more trips to Miami, then Mexico and later Milan.\n\nA source close to Disick told PEOPLE at the time that Sofia had begun calling Disick her \u201cboyfriend,\u201d adding, \u201cShe thinks he\u2019s the best.\u201d\n\nAnd it appeared the feeling was mutual: \u201cScott likes having her around,\u201d added the source. \u201cShe isn\u2019t a wild party animal.\u201d\n\nSplash News\n\nSofia Richie/Instagram\n\nWhile the two seemed to be happy together, one person had their reservations: Richie patriarch Lionel. A source close to the singer told PEOPLE in October that Lionel \u201cthinks Scott is the worst person she could ever see and that he raised her better than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe thinks she should have more respect for herself as a young woman,\u201d the source continued. \u201cLionel knows Scott\u2019s playboy ways and he doesn\u2019t want to see his daughter get hurt.\u201d\n\nRob Latour/Variety/REX/Shutterstock\n\nFizzling Out?\n\nBy November, a source told PEOPLE the romance had begun to \u201cfizzle\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re starting to argue more, and it\u2019s bothering Sofia,\u201d the source said. \u201cShe thought he would be more serious about their relationship and is finding herself to be more frustrated with him as time goes on. Everything everyone has been telling her to look out for, she\u2019s now starting to see for herself. It\u2019s really upsetting for her, but she is trying to work through it.\u201d\n\nBut the tensions in the relationship didn\u2019t seem to last long, with the couple being spotted on vacation in Mexico days later.\n\nLater that month, the model opened up about her relationship on the red carpet at the SAG-AFTRA Foundation Patron of the Artists Awards in Beverly Hills, telling E! News that her father had been \u201cvery supportive\u201d of their relationship.\n\n\u201cI am into her business and she\u2019s trying to keep me out of her business,\u201d added Lionel, 68.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been very cool. He\u2019s very supportive, whatever that means,\u201d Sofia said as Lionel jokingly pointed a gun-shaped hand gesture at his head.\n\nOfficial Debut\n\nDisick and Sofia made their official debut as a couple in December at a party for DuJour magazine, arriving together at the Confidante Hotel in Miami.\n\nAlthough Sofia posed solo on the red carpet, the lovebirds were seen \u201cchatting and kissing throughout the night,\u201d sources told PEOPLE.\n\nAndrew Toth/Getty\n\nThe couple coordinating their looks \u2014 she in a body-hugging, long-sleeved black mini dress and he in black pants and a black button-down exposing his chest.\n\nThe two also made an appearance at Art Basel, where they were followed by a camera crew that filmed their every move, including their PDA.\n\nAn onlooker told PEOPLE that the couple was affectionate throughout the night, sharing cell phones to take photos. The onlooker added Sofia even placed Disick\u2019s phone in his back pocket before giving him a \u201csweet kiss on the cheek.\u201d\n\nFirst Christmas\n\nThe lovebirds went on to celebrate their first Christmas season together, with Sofia getting into the holiday spirit by dancing around the kitchen to Lionel\u2019s 1983 classic \u201cAll Night Long (All Night)\u201d while dressed in some Santa-themed sleepwear \u2014 minus the pants. (She paired the top with some white briefs and matching cozy socks.)\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Sofia Richie and Scott Disick Kick Off Their Christmas Weekend Together\n\nShe put on the routine for her boyfriend, who shared her dance moves on his Instagram stories, labeling the video simply, \u201cNight.\u201d\n\nBut Disick later flew solo at the annual Christmas Eve party hosted by his ex Kourtney Kardashian\u2018s mom Kris Jenner.\n\nHitting the Slopes\n\nThe pair was spotted in Aspen, Colorado in late December, after sharing several photos of themselves boarding a private jet together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on a whole new year vibe,\u201d Disick captioned a picture of him and Richie cozied up together before take off.\n\nDate Night\n\nBACKGRID\n\nAfter ringing in the new year with a romantic trip to Aspen, Colorado, the couple was spotted leaving Toscana after a dinner date in Los Angeles in early January. The two held hands as they left the restaurant, wearing coordinating black and white outfits, with Richie showing off her abs in a crop top.\n\nThrowing Shade\n\nOn Jan. 27, Kendall Jenner left a pointed comment on a photo shared by a fan account of Disick riding in a car with Sofia and the children he shares with ex Kourtney: sons Reign, 3, Mason, 8, and daughter Penelope, 5\u00bd.\n\n\u201cAwww Scott and his kids,\u201d wrote Kendall, shading the couple\u2019s age gap.\n\n\u201cYou could tell that the kids don\u2019t know Sofia well because they weren\u2019t holding her hand. Instead, they all stayed close to Scott,\u201d a source told PEOPLE of the dinner. \u201cIt was a short dinner. Scott and Sofia were not affectionate. The kids seemed fine with her, but all sat close to Scott. He helped them at dinner and with potty breaks.\u201d\n\nThe source added, \u201cSofia acted like Scott\u2019s friend and you could tell she was trying a gentle approach to get his kids\u2019 approval.\u201d\n\nAt the time, a source also told PEOPLE that Kourtney, 39, didn\u2019t react positively to the news at first.\n\n\u201cLike most people, she thinks Sofia is way too young for him and doesn\u2019t get it,\u201d said the insider.\n\nCoordinating Couple\n\nMEGA\n\nDespite Kendall\u2019s subtle shade, the couple showed no signs of slowing down the romance.\n\nOn Feb. 8, they enjoyed a date night out at Nobu in Malibu wearing matching camouflage ensembles. Richie sported a slouchy top, baggy camouflage pants and crisp white Reebok sneakers, while Disick opted for an camo hoodie, black pants and white sneakers that matched his girlfriend\u2019s.\n\nPuppy Love\n\nSofia Richie and her new puppy. Sofia Richie/Instagram\n\nAt the Issey Miyake Launch Party at Milk Studios in Los Angeles on Feb. 22, Sofia told PEOPLE exclusively about how her boyfriend came up with the name for her new wiener dog, gifted to her by Disick.\n\n\u201cHer name\u2019s [Hershela],\u201d she said, not specifying the exact spelling. \u201cMy boyfriend named her \u2026 I kind of just ran with it. It made me laugh. I liked Hershey and he liked Hershela, so it was like a middle ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe wanted the dog for a while, but he ended up surprising me with it,\u201d she added.\n\nFamily Vacations\n\nThe following month, Sofia and Disick hit another milestone in their relationship: In late March, they took a vacation with his three kids, flying to Cabo San Lucas via private jet, where they stayed at the luxury Chilean Bay resort & residences.\n\nA source told PEOPLE they were \u201chaving fun in the sun\u201d and spent time \u201cswimming in the pools and enjoying the resort.\u201d\n\nRomantic Gestures\n\nIn late April, Sofia took to Instagram to show off Disick\u2019s latest romantic gesture, sharing a photo of him posing on a bed with rose petals in the shape of a heart.\n\nBirthday Boy\n\nTo celebrate Disick\u2019s 35th birthday on May 26, the couple flew to St. Barts with his three kids.\n\nSofia wished her man a happy birthday with a photo of the two getting cozy in the water. Later that evening, she shared a photo on her Instagram story of them sharing a kiss on the lips.\n\n\u201cHappy birthday babe! Thank you for being you,\u201d she captioned the post. \u201cLove you.\u201d\n\nSofia Richie/Instagram\n\nWhile the two were vacationing, a source told PEOPLE that Kourtney had begun to warm up to the relationship.\n\n\u201cIt helps that Kourtney now trusts Sofia,\u201d said the insider. \u201cThe kids are allowed to spend time with her. Sofia likes having them and helps Scott. So far, the kids are giving Kourtney good reports about Sofia.\u201d\n\n\u201cSofia has shown over and over again that she is willing to stay with Scott even when things are not great \u2014 but Scott is doing well lately,\u201d added the source.\n\nIt\u2019s Over\n\nThings took a turn last week when Disick was spotted looking flirty with a mystery woman at Kanye West\u2018s Ye listening party in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Thursday night. Disick reportedly told guests that he and Richie were no longer together, according to TMZ.\n\nOver the weekend, a source confirmed to PEOPLE that Sofia had called it quits.\n\n\u201cSofia broke up with Scott,\u201d said the insider, adding that Disick\u2019s \u201cold issues\u201d contributed to the split.\n\n\u201cWhen Scott drinks, he is a sloppy mess and fools around,\u201d said the source.\n\nA second source added that Disick \u201ccheated on her, and she confronted him.\u201d\n\nAs for how Disick is dealing with the break up?\n\n\u201cScott seems fine,\u201d said the first source. \u201cHe even thinks she might change her mind. He isn\u2019t really taking it seriously.\u201d\n\nThe second source also speculated that \u201cit\u2019s likely not totally over.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve broken up multiple times since they started dating and always ended up back together,\u201d said the insider. \u201cNo one would be surprised if they\u2019re out again together in a few days or weeks.\u201d\n\nMoving Out\n\nAlthough multiple insiders said there\u2019s a good chance for a reconciliation, one source confirmed to PEOPLE that Sofia moved out of Disick\u2019s house after the breakup to stay with her dad, music icon Lionel Richie.\n\n\u201cShe has been living at Lionel\u2019s house for the past couple of days,\u201d said the source. \u201cShe is looking for her own place.\u201d\n\nAs for how Sofia is adjusting to the breakup? \u201cShe seems to be doing okay,\u201d added the insider. \u201cShe is surrounding herself with girlfriends and keeping busy.\u201d\n\nNot So Fast\n\nBy Monday, the duo appeared to have reconciled and were spotted leaving beachside eatery Nobu in Malibu before hitting up a grocery store together.\n\nBENS / BACKGRID\n\nScott Disick/Instagram\n\nDisick also publicly denied that the two had ever split, posting a screenshot on his Instagram story of a TMZ headline that read: \u201cSofia Richie & Scott Disick Still Together.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had no idea we even broke up but thanks for thinking of us,\u201d he captioned the post.", "images":
