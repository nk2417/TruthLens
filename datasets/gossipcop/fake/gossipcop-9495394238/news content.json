{"url": "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megyn_Kelly", "text": "American political commentator and journalist (born 1970)\n\nMegyn Marie Kelly ( ; born November 18, 1970)[2] is an American journalist, attorney, political commentator, and media personality.[3][4][5] She currently hosts The Megyn Kelly Show, a talk show and podcast that airs daily on Sirius XM's Triumph channel and has over 4 million subscribers on YouTube.[6] Kelly previously worked at Fox News from 2004 to 2017, where she hosted programs including America Live and The Kelly File, and at NBC News from 2017 to 2018, where she anchored Megyn Kelly Today. In 2025, she launched MK Media, a podcast and video network featuring commentary and news programs from independent creators. She was named one of Time's 100 most influential people of 2014 and 2025.[7][8][9][10]\n\nDuring her time at Fox News, Kelly hosted America Live from 2010 to 2013 and co-anchored America's Newsroom with Bill Hemmer. She also moderated several presidential primary debates during the 2016 and 2024 election cycles. Her show The Kelly File, which aired from 2013 to 2017, focused on breaking news and political events and was one of the network's top-rated programs. After leaving Fox News in January 2017, Kelly joined NBC News to host Megyn Kelly Today. She left NBC in January 2019 and later transitioned to independent media with her podcast and online platforms.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nKelly was born on November 18, 1970 in Champaign, Illinois,[11][12] to Edward Francis Kelly, Ed.D.,[13] who taught in the School of Education at the State University of New York at Albany, and Linda (n\u00e9e DeMaio), a homemaker.[14] She grew up with an older sister, Suzanne (1964\u20132022) and an older brother, Pete (born c. 1965).[15] She is of Italian and German descent on her mother's side and Irish descent on her father's.[14] She was raised Catholic.[16] Her father died of a heart attack in 1985 when she was 15 years old.[17][18] She also has a step-sister and a step-brother from her mother's second marriage, to Peter Kirwan.[19]\n\nKelly attended Tecumseh Elementary School in suburban Syracuse, New York. When she was 9, her family moved to Delmar, New York, a suburb of Albany,[20][12] where she attended Bethlehem Central High School.[21] After high school, she studied political science at Syracuse University, graduating in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts.[14][22] She then attended Albany Law School, where she was an editor of the Albany Law Review.[23] She graduated in 1995 with a Juris Doctor.[24]\n\nKelly was an associate attorney in the Chicago office of law firm Bickel & Brewer LLP. In fall 1996, she co-wrote an article, \"The Conflicting Roles of Lawyer as Director\", for the American Bar Association's journal, Litigation.[25] She later worked at Jones Day Law Firm for nine years, where one of her clients was the credit bureau Experian.[26]\n\nMedia career\n\nEarly career\n\nIn 2003, Kelly moved to Washington, D.C., where she was hired by the ABC affiliate WJLA-TV as a general assignment reporter.[18] She covered national and local events, including live coverage of the confirmation hearings for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito and Chief Justice John G. Roberts, the retirement of Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and the 2004 presidential election.[27] CNN president Jonathan Klein later said he regretted not hiring Kelly as a reporter at the beginning of her career, because she was \"the one talent you'd want to have from somewhere else\".[21]\n\n2004\u20132017: Fox News\n\nIn 2004, Kelly applied for a job at Fox News.[27] She contributed legal segments for Special Report with Brit Hume and hosted her own legal segment, Kelly's Court, during Weekend Live. She appeared in a weekly segment on The O'Reilly Factor and occasionally filled in for Greta Van Susteren on On the Record, where most of her reporting focused on legal and political matters. She occasionally contributed as an anchor, but more often as a substitute anchor on weekends.[28] On February 1, 2010, Kelly began hosting her own two-hour afternoon show, America Live, which replaced The Live Desk.[29][30] She was a guest panelist on Fox News' late-night satire program Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld. In 2010, viewership for America Live increased by 20%, averaging 1,293,000 viewers, and increased by 4% in the 25\u201354 age demographic, averaging 268,000 viewers.[31] In December 2010, Kelly hosted a New Year's Eve special with Bill Hemmer.[32]\n\nKelly received media attention for her coverage of the results of the 2012 United States presidential election. On election night, Fox News' decision desk projected that Obama would win the state of Ohio along with a second term after part of the results had been released. Republican operative Karl Rove objected to this projection, whereupon Kelly - with camera following - dramatically walked backstage to the decision desk and spoke with them; she also asked Rove, \"Is this just math that you do as a Republican to make yourself feel better? Or is this real?\"[33][34][35][36] Kelly left America Live in July 2013 and took maternity leave. That October she began hosting a new nightly program, The Kelly File.[37] The Kelly File was occasionally the channel's ratings leader, topping The O'Reilly Factor.[38][39]\n\nIn December 2013, Kelly commented on a Slate article on The Kelly File: \"For all you kids watching at home, Santa just is white, but this person is just arguing that maybe we should also have a black Santa,\" adding, \"But Santa is what he is, and just so you know, we're just debating this because someone wrote about it.\" Kelly also said that Jesus was a white man later in the segment.[40] Soon after, Jon Stewart,[41] Stephen Colbert,[42] Rachel Maddow,[43] Josh Barro,[44] and others satirized her remarks.[45] Two days later, she said on the air that her original comments were \"tongue-in-cheek\",[46][47][48][49][50] and that the skin color of Jesus is \"far from settled\".[51] In June 2015, Kelly interviewed Jim Bob Duggar and Michelle Duggar of 19 Kids and Counting regarding their son Josh Duggar's alleged molestation of five girls in 2002. She later interviewed two of their daughters, Jill and Jessa. This show's Nielsen national estimates ratings of 3.09 million viewers, above its average 2.11 million, ranked with the 3.2 million for the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 shootdown coverage and 7.3 million for the Ferguson riots coverage.[52]\n\nIn the Republican Party presidential debate on August 6, 2015, Kelly asked then-presidential candidate Donald Trump whether a man of his temperament ought to be elected president, noting that he has called various women insulting names in the past.[53] Kelly's moderating generated a range of media and political reactions and her professionalism was crudely criticized by Trump.[54][55][56][57] Kelly responded to Trump's criticism by saying she would not \"apologize for doing good journalism\".[58] Trump declined to attend the Iowa January 28 debate that she moderated.[59] After the debate and off-camera, Ted Cruz said that Kelly had referred to Trump off-camera as \"Voldemort\", though Fox News denied it.[60] Bill Maher complimented Kelly as being \"so much better\" than the candidates who attended the January 28 debate and argued that she was a more viable candidate for the Republican nomination.[61] According to reporting by The Atlantic, she had been \"ordered\" by Rupert Murdoch, then in control of Fox News, \"to hit Trump hard\".[62]\n\nIn an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning, Kelly reflected that she was disappointed with the lack of support she received from coworker Bill O'Reilly and CNN, the latter airing a Trump event the same time as the debate.[63][64] In April, at her request,[65] Kelly met with Trump at Trump Tower, having \"a chance to clear the air\".[66] The following month, after interviewing Trump and being met with mixed reception,[67] she expressed interest in doing another one with him.[68] In June, she criticized Trump for his claims against judge Gonzalo P. Curiel's impartiality.[69] In October, a contentious discussion between Kelly and Newt Gingrich on The Kelly File regarding Trump's sexual comments in a 2005 audio recording gained widespread social media reaction.[70]\n\nIn March 2016, it was announced that Kelly would host a one-hour prime time special on the Fox network wherein she would interview celebrities from the worlds of \"politics, entertainment, and other areas of human interest\".[71] The special aired in May 2016, which was a sweeps month.[72] It acquired 4.8 million viewers, but placed third in the ratings.[73] Gabriel Sherman wrote of the stakes for Kelly as \"high\", elaborating that with Kelly being in the final year of her contract with Fox and having confirmed her ambitions, \"[t]he special was essentially a public interview for her next job.\"[74]\n\nIn July 2016, amid allegations of sexual harassment on the part of Fox News CEO Roger Ailes, Kelly was reported to have confirmed that she herself was also subjected to his harassment.[75][76] Two days after the report, Ailes resigned from Fox News and his lawyer, Susan Estrich, publicly denied the charge.[77] During Kelly's coverage of the 2016 Republican National Convention, her attire received criticism.[78] In a defense of Kelly, Jenavieve Hatch of The Huffington Post commented, \"If you're a woman on national television reporting on a political event from hot, humid Cleveland, wearing a weather-appropriate outfit makes you the target of an endless stream of sexist commentary.\"[79] In September 2016, it was reported that Kelly would be collaborating with Michael De Luca to produce Embeds, a scripted comedy about reporters covering politics, to be aired on a streaming service.[80][81] Kelly appeared on the cover of the February 2016 issue of Vanity Fair.[82] In 2016, she was an honoree for Variety's Power of Women for her addressing child abuse.[83]\n\n2017\u20132018: NBC News\n\nKelly with Russian President Vladimir Putin, June 2017\n\nKelly with Russian President Putin, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern\n\nIn late 2016, with her Fox contract in its final months, Kelly was rumored to be actively considering moving to other news networks.[84][85] In January 2017, The New York Times reported that she would leave Fox News for a \"triple role\" at NBC News, which would include roles hosting a daytime talk show and a forthcoming Sunday-night newsmagazine, as well as becoming a correspondent for major news events and political coverage.[86][87] She departed Fox News on January 6, 2017, after the last episode of The Kelly File was aired.[88][89] In January 2017 People, quoting an unspecified source, reported that Kelly remained under a non-compete clause with Fox until July 2017, which would prevent her from working for a competitor until the clause expired, unless it would be canceled prior.[90]\n\nOn June 2, 2017, Kelly interviewed Russian president Vladimir Putin, first in a panel discussion she moderated at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum and later in a one-on-one interview for the premiere episode of NBC's Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly, which aired June 4, 2017.[91][92][93] Kelly's daytime talk show, Megyn Kelly Today, premiered in September 2017.[94][95][96][97]\n\nKelly was paid reportedly between $15 million and $20 million a year at NBC.[98] After an initial run of eight episodes in the summer of 2017, NBC decided to bring her newsmagazine show Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly back for summer 2018 after a hiatus for football and the Winter Olympics, but only periodically. However, this return never materialized.[99][100] Instead, Kelly continued to report stories for Dateline NBC during the summer of 2018, continuing her work for the show which she joined in 2017.[101]\n\nOn October 23, 2018, Kelly was criticized for on-air remarks she made on Megyn Kelly Today related to the appropriateness of blackface as part of Halloween costumes. She recollected that \"when I was a kid, that was okay as long as you were dressing up like a character\", and defended Luann de Lesseps's use of skin darkening spray to wear a Diana Ross Halloween costume.[102][103] After receiving backlash for her comments, Kelly issued an internal email apologizing for the remarks later that day.[104] Three days later, NBC canceled Megyn Kelly Today.[105] It had been reported that Kelly was considering ending the program to focus on her role as a correspondent.[106] Her employment was terminated on January 11, 2019, and she was paid the $30 million due for the remainder of her contract.[107][108][109]\n\n2020\u2013present: Independent Media\n\nKelly speaking at the 2025 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) at the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center in National Harbor, Maryland.\n\nKelly announced the launch of Devil May Care Media, her media production company, on September 10, 2020, with a podcast, The Megyn Kelly Show.[110] Its first episode premiered on September 28, 2020.[111] On July 6, 2021, it was announced that the podcast would move to Sirius XM on September 7, 2021, to broadcast weekdays at 12 noon ET on the talk radio channel Triumph, along with a video simulcast available to Sirius XM subscribers.[112]\n\nSince transitioning to independent media, The Megyn Kelly Show has experienced significant growth. In July 2023, the show's YouTube channel attracted 116.8 million views, surpassing the viewership of major news outlets during the same period, including NBC News (78 million) and CBS News (83 million).[113] As of November 2025, Kelly's YouTube channel alone has over 4 million subscribers,[6] and it has become one of the top ten podcasts in the U.S. Despite running with a small team, her show has gained significant traction, positioning her as a prominent figure in the digital media space.[114]\n\nOn December 6, 2023, Kelly returned to the moderator desk to co-host the fourth Republican primary debate on NewsNation, alongside Elizabeth Vargas and Eliana Johnson.[115][116] This marked her first return to moderating a presidential debate since her time at Fox News, where she famously moderated the first Republican Party presidential debate in 2015.[117] The debate, which was hosted by independent media figures, was part of the Republican National Committee's move toward embracing alternative media platforms over traditional establishment networks.[118] The event took place without the participation of Donald Trump, the leading Republican candidate at the time.[119]\n\nOn November 4, 2024, the day before the 2024 presidential election, Kelly publicly endorsed Donald Trump at a rally in Pittsburgh. In her speech, she expressed support for his policies on women's rights, border security, immigration, and transgender athletes in women's sports, stating that he would be a \"protector\" of women.[120] Afterward, Kelly posted a selfie with Trump on X, captioned, \"God bless him. Go vote for him!\"[121] While Kelly had previously clashed with Trump during the 2016 campaign, when he referred to her as \"nasty\" following a widely publicized debate exchange, her endorsement in 2024 revealed a stark change in their relationship.[122][123]\n\nKelly attended the Trump's second inauguration in January 2025, and delivered remarks on stage at his rally the night before.[124]\n\nOn February 18, 2025, Kelly announced the launch of a second podcast, AM Update with Megyn Kelly, which premiered on February 19. Unlike The Megyn Kelly Show, which features guest discussions and debates, AM Update follows a daily digest format, summarizing major headlines.[125]\n\nOn March 10, 2025, Kelly won the IHeartRadio podcast award for Best Political Podcast.[126][127]\n\nIn March 2025, Kelly launched MK Media, a podcast and video network focused on news and entertainment. Its initial lineup included Next Up with Mark Halperin, The Nerve with Maureen Callahan, and Spot On with Link Lauren, with new episodes airing multiple times per week. The network expanded on Kelly\u2019s existing media presence, including The Megyn Kelly Show and AM Update, with longtime producer Steve Krakauer overseeing production. Additional shows were reported to be in development.[128][129] With the first additional show After Party with Emily Jashinsky launching in June 2025.[130]\n\nOn May 6, 2025, Kelly's podcast ranked 3rd in Top Right-Wing podcasts by subscribers for Q1. Her podcast had the most YOY % growth at 176%. She is also the only female in the top 10.[131][132]\n\nPolitical views\n\nPolitical affiliation\n\nKelly has been a registered Independent since 2008,[133][134] and told Variety in 2015 that she had voted for both Democrats and Republicans.[135]\n\nIn April 2024, Kelly revealed that she voted for Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election and would vote for him again in 2024 despite their turbulent relationship in the past. She explained that her decision was driven particularly by issues like transgender issues and cultural changes that were affecting her children. Kelly stated that her vote was based on principles rather than personal preference, emphasizing her desire to protect traditional values and preserve fundamental freedoms.[136][137]\n\nIn 2025, Kelly opened up about her shift in political standing over the years on The Megyn Kelly Show, stating that:[138]\n\n\"When I was at Fox and then for that year at NBC, I was more in the center. I was like definitely center-right. Now I think I'm pretty conservative. I mean, I just am now. I mean, the earth has shifted such that I think I have to say, yes, by today's standards, you'd call me conservative. But that's thanks to them. What they did to me, they were vicious. They're complete assholes. Their woke ideology completely radicalized me against them. And I love that. It empowered me in a way that allowed me to see the truth about them. That was very helpful to me. I wouldn't undo it if I could because it really helped me understand who I was dealing with over there.\"\n\nLGBTQ issues\n\nIn 2023, Kelly explained that her opinion had shifted from supporting \"preferred pronouns\" to opposing them, citing concerns about their connection to gender-affirming care for minors. She argued that such policies harmed women's rights and children's safety. Kelly stated she would no longer use preferred pronouns but would still approach transgender individuals with empathy. She also criticized the inclusion of transgender women in women's spaces and sports, as well as medical intervention for transgender youth.[139]\n\nIn 2024, after singer Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris before the 2024 presidential election, citing her running mate Tim Walz's LGBTQ policies, Kelly criticized the endorsement during an on-stage interview with Tucker Carlson. She accused Swift of \"alienating half her fan base\" by taking a side in a hotly contested debate, adding, in reference to Walz\u2019s LGBTQ policies, \"...that is what Taylor Swift just endorsed for your children. So screw you, Taylor Swift.\"[140]\n\nGun policy\n\nIn response to the Minneapolis Catholic school shooting in August 2025, Kelly argued on The Megyn Kelly Show that broad gun reform would be ineffective in the United States given the prevalence of firearms and constitutional protections under the Second Amendment. She stated that \u201cthe bad guys are the ones who get them. You would just be disarming the law-abiding ones,\u201d explaining that individuals intent on committing mass violence would either obtain guns illegally or find other means to carry out attacks. Kelly said she supported targeted interventions for individuals with serious mental health concerns, adding that \u201cputting red flags all over people who have serious mental health histories and trying to take their guns away, I'm with you. I'm actually more to the left on that issue than a lot of my conservative friends.\u201d[141]\n\nInstead, Kelly advocated for increased armed security at schools and adjacent institutions, stating that \u201cwe need more good guys with guns on soft targets,\u201d and called for improvements in the mental health system. She also criticized media and political discussions that focus primarily on gun control, arguing that such debates distract from practical measures that would protect children.[142] Kelly argued that while the United States cannot eliminate every threat, it could take concrete steps to better secure schools and other vulnerable locations, reiterating her view that gun control is not the answer.[143][144]\n\nIsrael\u2013Hamas conflict\n\nIn an August 2025 discussion with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene about the Gaza war, Kelly said that while she believes children in Gaza are starving and hurting, she blames Hamas, arguing that Hamas has stolen aid and uses the suffering of children for propaganda purposes. She also described the Palestinians as \"very good manipulators of media,\" adding that she no longer trusts casualty figures released by Hamas, and said Israel was \"losing the propaganda war\" as a result.[145]\n\nWriting\n\nIn February 2016, Kelly signed an agreement with HarperCollins to write an autobiography scheduled for release later that year, in a deal worth more than $10 million.[146][147][148] The book, titled Settle for More, was released on November 15, 2016.[149][150]\n\nAccolades\n\nIn popular culture\n\nBombshell\n\nBombshell, a 2019 film about Roger Ailes' sexual misconduct and resignation from Fox News, was released on December 13, with Charlize Theron portraying Kelly\u2014a role that earned an Oscar nomination.[154] Kelly said she wasn\u2019t consulted for the film, but after viewing it, she hosted a roundtable with others involved, confirming and disputing parts of the film and calling it an emotional experience.[155][156]\n\nMr. Birchum\n\nIn early 2023, Kelly teased that she had to join SAG-AFTRA for an upcoming secret project. On November 30, 2023, she revealed on her show that she was set to star alongside Danny Trejo, Roseanne Barr, and Adam Carolla in Mr. Birchum, a new Daily Wire adult animated comedy series which debuted in early 2024.[157][158]\n\nPersonal life\n\nKelly speaking at the 2024 Young Women's Leadership Summit at the San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter on the River Walk in San Antonio, Texas\n\nKelly was first married in 2001 to Daniel Kendall, an anesthesiologist, in a Catholic ceremony. Their marriage ended in divorce in 2006.[159] In March 2024, Kelly disclosed that she was undergoing the Catholic annulment process for her marriage with Kendall.[160]\n\nIn 2008, Kelly married Douglas Brunt, then president and CEO of the cybersecurity firm Authentium.[161] Brunt later transitioned to a career as a full-time writer and novelist.[162] The couple has three children: son Yates (born 2009), daughter Yardley (born 2011), and son Thatcher (born 2013),[163][164][165][166] all conceived through in vitro fertilization.[167][168] The family resides in Connecticut during the school year, and spends summers at their waterfront home in New Jersey.[169]\n\nKelly is a lifelong Roman Catholic.[170] She has appeared at a fundraiser for the conservative group Moms for Liberty and Turning Point USA's Young Women's Leadership Summit.[171][172] She has stated that she has Raynaud's disease.[173][174]\n\nIn 2022, Kelly announced that her older sister, Suzanne Crossley, had died from a heart attack following a battle with opioid addiction.[175] Crossley left behind three children and a grandson.[176][177]\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n", "images": ["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Megyn_Kelly_%2854358337727%29.jpg/250px-Megyn_Kelly_%2854358337727%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/20px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/20px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Megyn_Kelly_%2853805263249%29.jpg/250px-Megyn_Kelly_%2853805263249%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/20px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Megyn_Kelly_%2854670579634%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/250px-Megyn_Kelly_%2854670579634%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Wikidata-logo.svg/40px-Wikidata-logo.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/40px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/DodgerBlue_flag_waving.svg/20px-DodgerBlue_flag_waving.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Megyn_Kelly_%2854670579634%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/960px-Megyn_Kelly_%2854670579634%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Prime_Minister_Narendra_Modi_speaks_with_Russian_President_Vladimir_Putin%2C_Austrian_Federal_Chancellor_Christian_Kern%2C_and_Moldovan_President_Igor_Dodon_on_the_sidelines_of_the_St_Petersburg_International_Economic_Forum.jpg/250px-thumbnail.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Megyn_Kelly_in_2012.jpg/250px-Megyn_Kelly_in_2012.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5b/Greater_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_States.svg/120px-Greater_coat_of_arms_of_the_United_States.svg.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Vladimir_Putin_and_Megyn_Kelly_03.jpg/250px-Vladimir_Putin_and_Megyn_Kelly_03.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Megyn_Kelly_%2854670579634%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/960px-Megyn_Kelly_%2854670579634%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megyn_Kelly", "title": "Megyn Kelly", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Megyn_Kelly_%2854670579634%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/960px-Megyn_Kelly_%2854670579634%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "width": 901, "height": 1200}, "title": "Megyn Kelly - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
