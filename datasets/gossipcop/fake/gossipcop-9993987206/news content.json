It was a no caption provided, no caption needed kind of post.\n\nWhile there is a lot of speculation, not much is really known about the nuptials. It was was said that the Aussie actress landed at the Gold Coast Airport in Queensland wearing a \u201cI Do Down Under\u201d T-shirt. The wedding reportedly took place in Byron Bay. Her mother and three siblings, including her actor brother Cameron (who was snapped with a bunch of apparent wedding-goers), were in attendance.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe website news.com.au has photos from the wedding. Robbie is wearing an off-the-shoulder white dress with a very country wedding vibe.\n\nTwo weeks ago there was a hint that something was up when she posted this steamy lip-lock pic. Prior to that, she had mostly kept their romance off social media. (They have never appeared together on the red carpet either.)\n\nHere they are at a wedding in August:\n\nRobbie met Ackerley in 2013 on the set of the World War II drama Suite Fran\u00e7aise, according to a Vogue profile from May. At the time, she wasn\u2019t looking for romance, explaining, \u201cI was the ultimate single gal. The idea of relationships made me want to vomit. And then this crept up on me. We were friends for so long. I was always in love with him, but I thought, \u2018Oh, he would never love me back. Don\u2019t make it weird, Margot. Don\u2019t be stupid and tell him that you like him.\u2019 And then it happened, and I was like, \u2018Of course we\u2019re together. This makes so much sense, the way nothing has ever made sense before.\u2018\u201d\n\nShe went on to describe him as \u201cthe best-looking guy in London.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nRumors started to swirl that they were engaged in the summer of 2015, when they were photographed wearing matching gold bands. However, Robbie never confirmed the news.\n\nWe guess she was just holding out to confirm her wedding. And, pow, did she ever.\n\nFind out more about her new husband here:", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/a3SvhM2JYPFncWeijY0RWw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNTtoPTg5NztjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/35af7ec823b43576739e8b6ebfd981ad", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_p_entertainmentv2_2.png", "https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2016-12-20/c473cbd0-c6cc-11e6-8a28-57262eccce99_Screen-Shot-2016-12-20-at-8-41-43-AM.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/P6tG0wjlENk4VrShTkDcsw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTEzMTU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/4e2c29bfa99cd2f8f46ea81b99fee882", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OBHrIg7MB2xtqanBWabbAA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY0NDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/os/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/cc1b941af16d038d82376b264c710bfc"], "top_img": "https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2016-12-20/c473cbd0-c6cc-11e6-8a28-57262eccce99_Screen-Shot-2016-12-20-at-8-41-43-AM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/margot-robbie-confirms-marriage-to-tom-ackerley-with-the-flip-of-a-finger-155419496.html", "title": "Margot Robbie Confirms Marriage to Tom Ackerley \u2014 With the Flip of a Finger", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Margot Robbie is a married woman \u2014 that\u2019s our takeaway from her latest Instagram.
