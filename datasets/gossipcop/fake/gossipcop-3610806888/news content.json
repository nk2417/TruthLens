Who\u2019s the girl?\u201d It featured images of the actor with a mysterious brunette stepping onto a private jet. However, the story didn\u2019t phase the actor too much, and he fired back with the perfect response:\n\n\u201cYou should have heard how upset Mila was that I spent the day with our cousin,\u201d he wrote on Twitter Sunday. \u201cSorry aunt Jodie these magazines lack integrity.\u201d\n\nYou should have heard how upset Mila was that I spent the day with our cousin.

In 2010, he took to Twitter to slam the magazine for claiming he was cheating on his then-wife, Demi Moore.\n\n\u201cI think Star magazine calling me a \u2018cheater\u2019 qualifies as defamation of character,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI hope my lawyer agrees.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/AshtonKutcher.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325_COVER-_IR_5x4.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?resize=150%2C150&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?fit=53%2C58&quality=80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/AshtonKutcher.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Film Editor", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/ashton-kutcher-calls-out-tabloid-for-cheating-story-these-magazines-lack-integrity/", "title": "Ashton Kutcher Calls Out Tabloid for Cheating Story: \u2018These Magazines Lack Integrity\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ashton Kutcher Calls Out Tabloid for Cheating Story: 'These Magazines Lack Integrity'", "description": "\"You should have heard how upset Mila was that I spent the day with our cousin,\" actor tweets in wry comeback", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/ashton-kutcher-calls-out-tabloid-for-cheating-story-these-magazines-lack-integrity/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/AshtonKutcher.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2017-07-10T15:41:10+00:00"}, "author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "ashton_kutcher, demi_moore, mila_kunis, star_magazine", "article-section": "news", "article-categories": "media, news", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499701270.0, "source": "http://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
