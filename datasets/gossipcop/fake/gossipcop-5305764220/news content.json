It flat-out lied?\n\nWow. Tell us more.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly what Manganiello himself has done.\n\nThe former True Blood star has issued his own spirited post on Instagram, slamming this same cover story and expressing love for his wife.\n\n\"Big surprise everyone but Star created a fake story and then photo shopped my wife\u2019s engagement ring off of her finger in order to sell magazines,\" he wrote.\n\n\"They are run by malicious trash. Do the world a favor and don\u2019t buy their garbage.\"\n\nWe agree!\n\nJust visit The Hollywood Gossip instead!\n\nWe do not charge a thing to read our celebrity news stories and we (mostly) guarantee that they are never fake.\n\nThe 40-year-old actor was mostly known for his amazing body and handsome face prior to falling for Vergara.\n\nHe opened up in the April issue of Ocean Drive magazine about being a part of a famous twosome these days.\n\n\"I was never part of a celebrity couple before this, because I never wanted to go through the difficulty that can bring in terms of paparazzi and attention,\" he said at the time.\n\n\"The two of us knew that once it became public that we were together \u2014 and we had conversations about how that would change a lot of thing.\n\n\"[Vergara] is the only woman on the planet that I was willing to go through all of that for, because she\u2019s the greatest.\"\n\nEveryone together now: AWWWWWW!\n\nManganiello added that the attention hasn\u2019t harmed their relationship at all.\n\nQuite the opposite, in fact.\n\n\"All that pressure has just brought us closer together,\" he says.\n\n\"It\u2019s not something that we welcome into our lives. We try to stay private.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it\u2019s really nobody else\u2019s business but ours. It\u2019s just that I love her and she loves me and here we are. And there is a price for that when living in the public eye.\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2202520805-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/sofia-vergara-and-joe-manganiello-are-attractive-720x540.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-517064198-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-10-at-2.14.17-PM-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/sofia-vergara-and-joe-manganiello-are-attractive-scaled.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/08/Screenshot-2025-08-15-at-10.55.26%E2%80%AFAM-80x80.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/sofia-vergara-and-joe-manganiello-are-attractive-790x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1110_padmalakshmi_melissaking_header-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/maddie-brush-kody-brown-1014x570-1-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/kate-gosselin-instagram-tout-111025-357409231cfb475d8cb3d7bd4616433c-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-185892571-80x80.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/sofia-vergara-and-joe-manganiello-are-attractive-scaled.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kay Rhodes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/05/sofia-vergara-and-joe-manganiello-defend-marriage-slam-haters-on/", "title": "Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello Defend Marriage, SLAM Haters on Instagram", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello Defend Marriage, SLAM Haters on Instagram", "description": "Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello would like to make something very clear: Not only do they comprise a great looking couple, but they are doing just great as a", "url": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/05/sofia-vergara-and-joe-manganiello-defend-marriage-slam-haters-on/", "site_name": "The Hollywood Gossip", "updated_time": "2022-04-24T10:11:15+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/sofia-vergara-and-joe-manganiello-are-attractive-scaled.jpg", "width": 1975, "height": 2560}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-05 14:26:50", "modified_time": "2022-04-24 10:11:15"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-05T14:26:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-04-24T10:11:15+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello Defend Marriage, SLAM Haters on Instagram", "description": "Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello would like to make something very clear: Not only do they comprise a great looking couple, but they are doing just great as a", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/sofia-vergara-and-joe-manganiello-are-attractive-scaled.jpg", "alt": "Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello are Attractive"}, "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Kay Rhodes", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "author": "Kay Rhodes", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "theme-color": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/cropped-THG-LOGO-270x270.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493994410.0, "source": "http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com", "summary": ""}
