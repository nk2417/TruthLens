Charlie Hunnam revealed in a new interview that he had a hard time bonding with his Lost City of Z costar Robert Pattinson.\n\nRelated: Stars Share Secrets Secrets don't stay secret long for some celebrities -- from deeply serious traumas to lighthearted revelations, read stars' shocking confessions\n\nSpeaking with Screen Daily for a Q&A published on Saturday, March 25, the Sons of Anarchy star, 36, said that he got an icy reception from the 30-year-old Twilight alum.\n\n\u201cI had a couple of rehearsal sessions with Sienna [Miller], but I didn\u2019t spend any time with Tom [Holland] or Robert,\u201d he told the site at the Berlin Film Festival. \u201cI wanted these relationships to evolve naturally on screen, through the work. I don\u2019t think I said more than ten words to Robert off camera.\u201d\n\nAccording to Hunnam, he wasn\u2019t certain if Pattinson was simply focused on his role \u2014 he plays fictional British corporal Henry Costin in the film \u2014 or if he just didn\u2019t care to forge a friendship.\n\nRelated: Biggest Costar Feuds and Fights Ever! These celebrities can\u2019t stand each other in real life \u2014 see the biggest costar feuds ever!\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if he was just \u2018in that zone\u2019 or if he genuinely didn\u2019t like me,\u201d Hunnam continued. \u201cThere was a real distance between us.\u201d\n\nSince the movie wrapped last year, the hunky blond told Screen Daily that Pattinson has made a few attempts to connect. \u201cHe\u2019s reached out to me subsequently, making overtures for us to be friends now,\u201d Hunnam added, \u201cso I think it was about the work.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars \u2014 They\u2019re Just Like Us! They may live in the spotlight, but these stars have no problem doing every day tasks\n\nHunnam was also intent on getting into character as he and the rest of the cast shot The Lost City of Z (based on the 2009 book, which tells the story of 1920s explorers who lose their way in the jungles of Brazil) on location in the Amazon.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be away from everybody, in a scaled back version of living as much as possible. They found this tiny hotel for me that was basically like little huts in the jungle where I could be by myself,\u201d he recalled to Screen Daily. \u201cI was so engaged in this process of no emails, no phone \u2014 I didn\u2019t speak to the rest of the outside world during the duration of the shooting. When we started shooting the explorations, the others wanted to stay in my hotel, but I couldn\u2019t break the [silent] spell. I just avoided them in the lunch room.\u201d\n\nThe Lost City of Z hits theaters Friday, April 14.", "images":
