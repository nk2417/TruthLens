Meaning, Ben entered an extremely high profile relationship with J.Lo (which ended, womp), while Jennifer started dating Cali Group CEO John Miller\u2014and kept things so low-key we barely noticed when they broke up / got back together. So clearly a timeline is in order, especially in light of news that John isn't exactly here for Jennifer's involvement in Ben and J.Lo's recent marriage drama.\n\nUm, by the way... Everything We Know About Bennifer Divorce\n\nOctober 2018\n\nJen Garner and Ben Affleck finalize their divorce on October 5. Then on October 10, a source tells People that she \"doesn't want to be single for the rest of her life\" and \"is open to dating\"\n\nSeveral weeks later on October 24, Jennifer and John's relationship breaks. Us Weekly is one of the first outlets to report the news, with a source saying \u201cThey\u2019ve been together six months \u2014 and it\u2019s getting pretty serious.\" Another insider adds that \u201cJen brings out the best in John, and he is the happiest he has probably ever been. It\u2019s a loving, healthy relationship.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, not to be outdone, People speaks to a source who confirms \"They are casually dating but it's not serious. He hasn't met her kids.\"\n\nNovember 2018\n\nPeople comes through with another source update. AHEM!\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t call him her boyfriend. But she loves getting attention from John. They have fun together and it\u2019s easy.\u201d\n\nAugust 2019\n\nA source tells Us Weekly that \u201cJen having a boyfriend has been the best thing to happen to Ben and Jen in a long time. Ben\u2019s become a better parent. He\u2019s really showing Jen that he can be a better person. They\u2019re coparenting in a way they never have before.\u201d\n\nThe outlet also reports that \u201cJohn is the complete opposite of Ben. Jen feels like she\u2019s finally found a true partner.... John and Jen are in similar places in their lives and can relate to raising kids after a divorce. They\u2019re on the same page and understand where things stand.\u201d\n\nJanuary 2020\n\nYet ANOTHER Us Weekly source says John \u201cvery much wants to marry\u201d Jen, but \u201cknows she can\u2019t be rushed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Jen posts a meme kinda implying she's on dating apps?\n\nFebruary 2020\n\nA source dishes about Jen and John's relationship to E! News, saying \"Jen still sees John and seems content with where things are in their relationship. John is a nice normal guy who is in a similar situation with raising kids while being divorced. They've made what they have work and enjoy being together. They are happy to see each other when they can. There isn't a lot of pressure to make it more than it is. He very much respects how seriously she takes her role as a mom and always put her kids first. They have both had a positive impact on each other.\"\n\nSome Casual Further Reading All the Wild Moments From J.Lo and Ben\u2019s \u2018Ship\n\nAugust 2020\n\nJennifer and John split after two years of dating, with a source telling Us Weekly \"He was ready for marriage and she just couldn\u2019t commit. They parted on very amicable terms.\"\n\nMarch 2021\n\nNewly-ish single Jen makes it clear she doesn't see herself getting married again, telling People \"I don't know. I'm so far from it. And I don't know that marriage would need to be a part... I mean I definitely don't think that I'll be single forever. But this is not the time. I don't need to complicate it. I'm good.\"\n\nMay 2021\n\nJohn and Jen are back together! A source tells Us Weekly, \u201cIt started up a few weeks ago.\u201d\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nThe pair are spotted on a cute cozy winter walk!\n\nCB/CB / BACKGRID\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nA source tells People, \"They have a very special relationship. It's never been the easiest one though since they both have families. They took a long break from dating, but Jen is very happy that they are back together.\"\n\nJune 2023\n\nI have never! seen! a sweeter! photo!\n\nBACKGRID\n\nNovember 2023\n\nUs Weekly chats to multiple sources about all things Jen and John. Some cute updates?\n\n\u201cJen and John are in a great place. They used to go out of their way to keep a low profile, but they\u2019ve both become very secure with their relationship and how it\u2019s all worked out.\u201d\n\n\u201cJen and John have a really special relationship. After having so much of her [marriage with Affleck] in the spotlight, she really enjoys being with someone who isn\u2019t a celebrity.\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn\u2019s been happy to go with the flow and do things Jen\u2019s way from day one. John is a romantic who\u2019s big on making sweet gestures and spoiling Jen when she least expects it.\u201d\n\nOh, and also a wedding isn't off the table. Per a source: \u201cJen and John want to take their time to plan out the specifics as far as the type of ceremony they want, where to live and whether or not they\u2019ll need a prenup. All that will come, but on their own timetable.\u201d\n\nJune 2024\n\nThings take a turn for the slightly \ud83d\ude2c thanks to a source telling the Daily Mail that John is tired of Jennifer trying to help fix Ben and J.Lo's marriage. \"Of course it bothers John that Jen is so hyper focused on her ex-husband. He cares deeply for Ben and sympathizes with what he is going through with Jennifer, but that doesn\u2019t mean Jen should be the one to fix her ex-husband\u2019s issues with his current wife. That makes no sense to anyone.\"\n\nThe insider adds, \"Jen is such a caring and wonderful woman and mother and there is nothing but a deep friendship and bond between her and Ben. John wants nothing more than for Ben to be okay, but it isn\u2019t his girlfriend\u2019s responsibility to play babysitter to him. That is for Ben to figure out on his own and for his wife to handle. It isn\u2019t Jen\u2019s responsibility, and he has told her this.\"\n\nAugust 2024\n\nAnother source tells the Daily Mail that \u201cJohn doesn\u2019t like sharing Jen and there is a divide when it comes to her and Ben. He wishes it wasn\u2019t like that because he understands they are a family, but it gets to him like it would anyone.\u201d\n\nThe insider also adds, \u201cJohn doesn\u2019t have any fears that they are getting back together\u2014but it has been tough coping with her support for Ben during his split from J.Lo.\u201d\n\nApparently John is \u201clooking forward to Ben and J.Lo\u2019s split being done so he can start focusing on Jen\u201d and \u201cboth Jen and John are hoping for that. It is just going to take a little time. They both want to be in a better place, but some work needs to be done.\u201d\n\nJanuary 2025\n\nMore rumored tension between John and Ben! An insider for Page Six claims John \"isn\u2019t thrilled\" about how much Ben has been leaning on his ex for support through his divorce from J.Lo, adding, \"He doesn\u2019t feel threatened in terms of Jen ever getting back with Ben, but at the same time it\u2019s hard not to feel jealous when it\u2019s clear they have a strong connection and friendship.\"\n\nPer the insider, \"Their growing bond is getting to be a bit much when Ben spends all the holidays with them like Christmas and Thanksgiving,\" leaving John feeling \"like a third wheel.\" They even go on to add, \"It used to be solely about the kids, but John feels like it could be more than just about their coparenting relationship.\"\n\nFebruary 2025\n\nThe Daily Mail obtains some rare pics of Jennifer and John packing on the PDA while out and about in L.A.\n\nNot long after, a source for Us Weekly dismisses rumors claiming John is jealous of Jennifer and Ben's bond. \"Everything is fine with John and Jen,\u201d the insider says, adding that \"those close to them haven\u2019t heard of any issues.\"\n\nHowever! Another insider then tells the Daily Mail that \"John is trying to deal with Ben and Jen's relationship by mostly staying quiet, but it's very hard to do that. He knows that Ben has to be around as a father and he is more than OK with that, but he wants to be the man in the relationship. John only talks about Ben when Jen talks about Ben or when their kids talk about him. He doesn't bring him up unprompted. John respects Ben, but less is more because John wants Jen for himself. He still needs to figure out how to compartmentalise it all.\"\n\n\ufeffMarch 2025\n\nA source tells the Daily Mail that John is less than thrilled about Ben and Jen's paintball PDA, saying \ufeff\ufeff\"Does it bother John when he sees the two of them being touchy-feely? Sure. It would get to anyone, but this is nothing new. Ben and Jen have a unique relationship, especially for exes. He loves her more than any woman he has ever loved besides his mom. But he also accepts that this cannot be. Not while she is devoted to someone else. Ben will always flirt with Jen, and she sees it as innocent.\"\n\n\ufeffApril 2025\n\n\ufeffA source tells Us Weekly\ufeff that \ufeff\ufeff\"John is basically living with Jennifer part-time. \ufeffHe has an office in L.A. and splits his time between staying there and at Jennifer\u2019s home. But he\u2019s been staying with Jennifer more often [and] doesn\u2019t want to impose, so he\u2019s looking for his own place\u2026 [and] deciding whether he\u2019ll rent or buy.\u201d\n\nAwk times, awk times.
