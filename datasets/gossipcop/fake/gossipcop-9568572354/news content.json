OJ Simpson\u2019s prison guard claims Khloe Kardashian begged the disgraced star for a paternity test to find out if he was her real dad\n\nKHLOE Kardashian reportedly begged OJ Simpson for a paternity test in order to find out if he was her real father.\n\nOJ\u2019s prison guard, Jeffrey Felix, claims he heard the pair having a conversation at Lovelock prison in Nevada, where Simpson is serving a 33-year jail term for robbery.\n\nJeffrey spoke in an upcoming documentary, Kardashian: The Man Who Saved OJ Simpson about his claims.\n\nKhloe\u2019s father Robert Kardashian became famous for his friendship with OJ and represented him at his 1995 murder trial for the murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Lye Goldman.\n\nRobert and Khloe\u2019s mother Kris were married for 13 years and had Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Rob together.\n\nHowever, there have been repeated rumours that Robert was not Khloe\u2019s biological father with his third wife, Ellen Pierson recently questioning his paternity.\n\nSpeaking in the documentary, which will air tonight on US channel Reelz, OJ\u2019s prison guard Jeffrey speaks about Khloe\u2019s relationship with the disgraced football star.\n\nHe said: \u201cKhloe is his favourite.\n\n\u201cThe mom Kardashian does not talk to OJ. She\u2019s upset with OJ for thinking that he killed her best friend, Nicole Brown.\n\n\u201cBut I know he still talks to Khloe behind her back.\n\n\u201cIn the prison, the phone calls have to be made out by OJ, so he would call at least once a week. That was his way of keeping up with the Kardashians\u2026\u201d\n\nHe then claims that her paternity came up in one of these conversations and OJ tried to calm her down.\n\nJeffrey said: \u201cOne day I could hear Khloe screaming in the phone.\n\n\u201cHe said she was upset because she wanted him to take a paternity test, because the media is all over him, to see if OJ is her actual dad \u2013 and OJ told her \u2018no\u2019.\n\n\u201cA few minutes after that phone call he pulled me up and asked me what I would do, and I told the Juice to take it, and he said \u2018no\u2019.\n\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Why won\u2019t you take it?\u2019. He said: \u2018It\u2019s a family matter, it\u2019s none of the public\u2019s business\u2019.\u201d\n\nBack in 2013, Robert Kardashian\u2019s third wife Ellen Pierson \u2013 who he married six weeks before his death back in 2003 \u2013 sold excerpts of his private diaries and claimed Khloe was not his daughter.\n\nRobert\u2019s second wife, Jan Ashley backed up Ellen\u2019s claims and said he told her that Khloe wasn\u2019t his.\n\nJan told Star magazine: \u201cKhloe is not his kid \u2014 he told me that after we got married.\n\n\u201cHe just kind of looked at me and said [it] like it was a matter of fact. He said, \u2018Well, you know that Khloe\u2019s not really a Kardashian, don\u2019t you?'\u201d\n\nHowever, in legal documents that surfaced when Robert was trying to gain an annulment from Jan, he described Khloe as his \u201cbiological child\u201d.\n\nBoth Khloe and her mother Kris reacted angrily to the claims and Khloe admitted earlier this year that it was really tough having other people discuss who her father was.\n\nSpeaking on Kocktails with Khloe, she said: \u201cI think the thing that most became overwhelming was when, like, the stuff happened with one of my dad\u2019s wives.\n\n\u201cShe wanted to come out, like, 10 years later after my dad passed away and said that I\u2019m not his daughter and that he confided in her and blah-say-blah.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Listen, you can talk about me and my sisters all you f***ing want. Do not talk about my dad\u2026He\u2019s not here!'\u201d\n\nNeither Kris or Khloe have responded to the fresh claims.\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/khloe-kardashian-instagram-e1465817362119.jpg?w=634", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/composite-khloe-kardashian-landscape.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict000242478699.jpg?w=939", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/kris-jenner-instagram-e1465817568901.jpg?w=634", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict000243197798.jpg?w=762", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict000219669867.jpg?w=694", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict000214780612.jpg?w=665", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/composite-khloe-kardashian-landscape.jpg?w=750", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nintchdbpict000242581260.jpg?w=789"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/composite-khloe-kardashian-landscape.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/1274188/oj-simpsons-prison-guard-claims-khloe-kardashian-begged-the-disgraced-star-for-a-paternity-test-to-find-out-if-he-was-her-real-dad/", "title": "OJ Simpson\u2019s prison guard claims Khloe Kardashian begged the disgraced star for a paternity test to find out if he was her real dad", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
