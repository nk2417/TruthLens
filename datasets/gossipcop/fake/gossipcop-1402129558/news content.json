The beauty guru, who also works with Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, did just that to Kate Hudson hours before she walked the red carpet in an ab-baring sequined Michael Kors ensemble.\n\nRead more Kate Hudson, Brie Larson Bare Their Midriffs at the Golden Globes\n\n\u201cWith Kate, there\u2019s no planning things, we just go with the wind,\u201d adds Babaii. \u201cWhen I saw her dress, I had this vision of Kim Basinger in 9 1/2 Weeks and Sharon Stone in Casino. I was, like, if those two had a haircut and it was today, what would it be like \u2014 a dirty boho \u201870s, \u201880s chic A-line bob.\u201d He told his longtime client \u2014 they met at the Globes 14 years ago, in fact \u2014 that he wanted to cut her hair, and she said, \u201cDo it.\u201d\n\nA photo posted by David Babaii (@davidbabaii) on Jan 10, 2016 at 5:11pm PST\n\nThe Sassoon-trained stylist first cut a \u201creally clean line\u201d and then, \u201cI was, like, enough with the cleanness and, like Edward Scissorhands, started cutting and chopping.\u201d The back is chopped \u201cway in\u201d while the front is much longer. The idea, he says, was to keep it free and fun. That idea extended to the products used as well. Babaii isn\u2019t typically a big fan of hair product, since it weighs locks down. But he made an exception for Pai-Shau Biphasic Infusion, which he applied on her damp hair to \u201cliterally bring the hair back to virgin quality.\u201d\n\nRead more Katy Perry Wears A Bumpit to Golden Globes\n\nThat was important, since Hudson went lighter with her hair color just last night. \u201cI said, \u2018Let\u2019s bring back circa 2005/2007 Kate Hudson!\u2019 \u201d said Babaii. He blow-dried her hair with a GHD round brush and Air Hairdryer ($225), then used Pai-Shau Royal Abundance Mousse all over, \u201ckind of crunched it in and rough dried it again with the blow-dryer.\u201d\n\nThe last step: the GHD Platinum White Styler Flat Iron ($229.99), which Babaii used to twist random sections here and there. \u201cI didn\u2019t want that curling iron look, I wanted chaos, like a little bend here and there,\u201d he said. To seal it all in, since the air outside is so damp, he finished with a spray of Pai-Shai Sublime Hold Hairspray for hold. Despite that, Babaii is not opposed to a little frizz. \u201cKate is a very free spirit, and with that million-dollar smile you don\u2019t want to constrict her with a \u2018do,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWith her, it\u2019s about keeping it boho chic.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/gettyimages-504391438_-_p_2016.jpg?w=2000&h=1126&crop=1", "http://qa.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/custom/Inline%20Graphics%20(Product%20Only)/2015/FallFashion3%20copy%202.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/gettyimages-504391438_-_p_2016.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/gettyimages-504391438_-_p_2016.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathryn Romeyn", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/kate-hudsons-a-line-lob-854217/", "title": "This Is How Kate Hudson\u2019s 7-Inch Golden Globes Haircut Came About", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "It\u2019s an A-line lob.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Kathryn Romeyn", "tags": "Angelina Jolie, Awards Season Style, beauty, Golden Globes, Golden Globes 2016, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kate Hudson, Red Carpet", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "This Is How Kate Hudson\u2019s 7-Inch Golden Globes Haircut Came About", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/kate-hudsons-a-line-lob-854217/", "description": "It\u2019s an A-line lob.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/gettyimages-504391438_-_p_2016.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Kate Hudson's A-line lob Golden Globes 2016 Haircut"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-10T19:15:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-01-10T19:54:07+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "It\u2019s an A-line lob.", "site": "@thr", "creator": "@katromeyn", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "This Is How Kate Hudson\u2019s 7-Inch Golden Globes Haircut Came About", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/gettyimages-504391438_-_p_2016.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1452453359.0, "source": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
