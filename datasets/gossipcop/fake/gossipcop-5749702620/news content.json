{"url": "people.com/music/kanye-west-explosive-fights-kris-jenner-kim-kardashian-control/", "text": "The last week has been a difficult one for the Kardashian-West family.\n\nAccording to multiple sources, Kanye West has cut off contact with multiple people in his inner circle, including his managers, lawyers and closest friends \u2014 and he\u2019s also had multiple arguments with his mother-in-law Kris Jenner.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had huge blow-ups with Kris. She sees how erratic he\u2019s acting and is most concerned about her daughter\u2019s brand. She\u2019s also trying to be a good mother-in-law, so he\u2019s having explosive issues with her too,\u201d a source close to the situation tells PEOPLE exclusively. \u201cEveryone is really, really worried.\u201d\n\n(However, another insider tells PEOPLE that \u201cKanye and Kris have never had a fight,\u201d adding, \u201cJust because Kanye is having a strong opinion does not mean that he is mentally ill or headed for a breakdown. It\u2019s unfair.\u201d)\n\nThe rapper returned to Twitter but has been posting tweets that are increasingly worrisome to some of his loved ones. In one recent tweet, West suggested the need to \u201cget rid of everything.\u201d\n\nA source close to the rapper contends that while West can be \u201ceccentric and erratic,\u201d not everyone sees his latest actions as cause for concern. Says the source: \u201cA lot of this is just Kanye. He\u2019s always been like that. He stirs the pot.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian Has Fun with Kanye\u2019s Advice That \u2018Sometimes You Need to Get Rid of Everything\u2019\n\nKardashian West playfully responded to her husband on social media, but the source close to the situation says it was an attempt to take charge. \u201cKim is trying to control him and the situation, but he can\u2019t be controlled,\u201d says the source about the couple, who are parents to 3-month-old Chicago, Saint, 2, and North, 4\u00bd. \u201cShe\u2019s trying her best to support him on social media and show a different side of things, but it\u2019s just not working.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe genuinely believes he\u2019s God and a genius and that he can do everything on his own. He has a great love for Kim, but in his mind he doesn\u2019t think Kim is a genius, and he\u2019s telling her he knows what he\u2019s doing,\u201d adds the source.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest from PEOPLE?

In audio released Tuesday morning by Hot 97, West can be heard telling Ebro \u201cI love you\u201d repeatedly.\n\nA West insider says the entertainer, 40, is \u201csleeping very little\u201d and \u201ctexting at all hours of the day or night\u201d and has been exhausting those around him.\n\nGilbert Carrasquillo/Getty\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to deal with,\u201d says the insider. \u201cHe\u2019s all over the place. If you can\u2019t be part of his creative genius, he\u2019ll cut you loose. That\u2019s what he says.\u201d\n\nThe source close to West \u2014 who says the rapper \u201cseemed great\u201d and \u201csuper positive\u201d on the phone last week \u2014 acknowledges the star is someone who \u201crevs really high and is really active and expends a lot of energy\u201d on his projects, but insists that\u2019s just how he is.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of being Kanye,\u201d says the source, who feels West was recently taken advantage of for radio publicity. \u201cHe\u2019s willing to take risks with his public persona. He doesn\u2019t take it as serious as the internet takes it.\u201d\n\nIn late 2016, West was hospitalized for exhaustion after canceling his Saint Pablo tour. Fans saw Kardashian West, 37, break down on Keeping Up with the Kardashians earlier this year as footage from that trying time finally aired.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on right now, it\u2019s getting pretty hectic at home,\u201d Kim said on the show. \u201cEveryone is just getting really worried.\u201d\n\nKim Kardashian Instagram\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in the mood to get into it right now\u2026 but it will be okay,\u201d she told her family. \u201cEverything will be okay. It\u2019s forcing him to take much-needed time off, which he needs. I think that will be really good for him. I feel a sense of responsibility just with the pressure of taking care of everything. Even after the robbery and everything, it\u2019s just I\u2019ve been staying home and I\u2019ve been looking to him to just take care of everything while I stay home.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe just never takes time off,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m just so drained. There was one moment where I just sat there and took deep breaths.\u201d", "images":
