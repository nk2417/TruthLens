She supposedly loves Eva.\n\nRyan Gosling is obsessed with his career, or maybe he just wants to focus on it at the moment.\n\nUp until now Eva hasn\u2019t pressured Ryan much, but as she is not getting any younger, her desire to have a family is taking precedence.\n\nAccording to the Ryan Seacrest show, Mendes told Gosling that if he\u2019s not ready to give her that ring, she would find someone who was. Ouch.\n\nSo, will this ultimatum work for Eva Mendes or will it turn Ryan Gosling off? Only time will tell. Maybe he needs to be put against a rock and a hard place to finally decide.\n\n[Image via magicinfoto / Shutterstock.com ]", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2421769f-57a4-4bff-913f-cf316747493e.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20157'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20492%20142'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo-white.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/29fe14088f2ae2c0c0bd1a3650e5c249?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent-Dark-Mode.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20120%20120'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/eva-mendes-gives-ryan-gosling-ultimatum-rumor", "title": "Eva Mendes Gives Ryan Gosling Ultimatum, Rumor", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.png", "description": "There\u2019s a rumor going around that Eva Mendes has given Ryan Gosling \u201cthe\u201d ultimatum.", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Eva Mendes Gives Ryan Gosling Ultimatum, Rumor - Inquisitr News", "description": "There\u2019s a rumor going around that Eva Mendes has given Ryan Gosling \u201cthe\u201d ultimatum.", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/eva-mendes-gives-ryan-gosling-ultimatum-rumor", "site_name": "Inquisitr News"}, "article": {"tag": "ryan gosling", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2013-08-19T15:09:00-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Eva Mendes Gives Ryan Gosling Ultimatum, Rumor - Inquisitr News", "description": "There\u2019s a rumor going around that Eva Mendes has given Ryan Gosling \u201cthe\u201d ultimatum.", "site": "@theinquisitr", "creator": "@theinquisitr"}, "generator": "WP Rocket 3.18.3"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1376939340.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
