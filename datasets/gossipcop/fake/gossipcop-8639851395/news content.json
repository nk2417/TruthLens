Tom Cruise, 55, and Jamie Foxx, 49, were once pals, as the megastar recruited the actor to star with him in 2004\u2019s action film Collateral. They remained friendly up until the Annie star began dating Katie Holmes, 38, just a year after she divorced Tom in 2012 in such a dramatic way. Four years later, Holmes and Foxx have finally taken their romance out into the open, but the Mission: Impossible star has aware that they were a couple for some time and isn\u2019t thrilled that his friend would date his former wife.\n\nHollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cTom has known about Katie and Jamie\u2019s secret relationship since the beginning and it has always bothered him that they were hooking up. While Katie and Jamie did their best to keep things a secret from the world, Tom is too well-connected and found out about them shortly after their romance began,\u201d a source close to Tom tellsEXCLUSIVELY. See pics of Tom and Katie\u2019s marriage in photos, here\n\n\u201cTom is shocked and upset that Katie is dating a costar he once considered a close friend. He feels betrayed by both of them,\u201d our insider adds. Katie broke away from Tom and the Church of Scientology in such a public way, serving him with divorce papers in June of 2012 when he was away on location in Iceland filming a movie. While she and daughter Suri, now 11, remained holed up in New York for months, Katie started going to more social events in 2013, and it was in August of that year that she met Jamie at a Hamptons gala.\n\nThe two were rumored to be secretly dating on the down-low for four years now, apparently out of respect for Tom by not making their relationship public and going to great lengths to never be photographed together. But now that over five years have passed since she filed for divorce, the couple apparently were less careful about keeping the romance out of the public eye. They were spotted over Labor Day weekend holding hands together while walking down the beach in Malibu and didn\u2019t appear to care that the paparazzi captured the PDA.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think now that they\u2019re out in the open as a couple, Katie and Jamie will start attending events together?", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/spl189824_001120706154200.jpg?fit=311%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/spl208482_008120706154157.jpg?fit=311%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/spl290071_005120706154154.jpg?fit=311%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-x-tom-cruise-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C349", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-x-tom-cruise-ftr.jpg?resize=384%2C216"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jamie-foxx-x-tom-cruise-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C349", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/09/07/tom-cruise-katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-relationship-dating-betrayed/", "title": "Tom Cruise Feels \u2018Betrayed\u2019 By Katie Holmes & Jamie Foxx\u2019s Secret Romance", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Tom Cruise is feeling really betrayed by his ex-wife Katie Holmes dating his onetime pal Jamie Foxx and taking their relationship public.", "google-site-verification": "Atm19DlLsEdntyQvdD3b8sMiONm67k-Es2Ds9GrBCvU", "news_keywords": "jamie foxx, Katie Holmes, Tom Cruise", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "amp-consent-blocking": "amp-ad,amp-iframe", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.7", "auto-social": "always", "author": "Beth Shilliday", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Tom Cruise Feels \u2018Betrayed\u2019 By Katie Holmes & Jamie Foxx\u2019s Secret Romance", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/09/07/tom-cruise-katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-relationship-dating-betrayed/", "description": "It always hurts if an ex ends up with one of your friends, but it\u2019s especially painful when everyone involved is famous!
