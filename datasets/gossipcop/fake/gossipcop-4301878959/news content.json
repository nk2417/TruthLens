The police uncovered at least 10 rifles in Paddock\u2019s room, including hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Eric Paddock, the brother of the suspect, told reporters on Monday that Stephen Paddock legally owned \u201ca couple\u201d of handguns and may have owned one long gun, \u201cbut he had them in a safe.\u201d It\u2019s still unclear how Paddock came into possession of so many rifles.\n\nIn a ten-tweet-long thread, John Mayer laid out a passionate argument for immediate change with regards to gun control. \u201cI\u2019m going to state my thoughts without the words \u2018gun control\u2019 \u2018assault rifles\u2019 and others that stoke reflexive debate,\u201d he began. \u201cI\u2019m a logic and reason guy. I like to remove emotion (impossible today) and look at an issue in a theoretical vacuum to make sense of it. Lawmakers and influencers: if you\u2019re not doing everything in your power to at least *reassess* the threat of mass murder, why can\u2019t you come out and tell us that this is the life we\u2019re going to have to accept? That these are the new terms? That it\u2019s a fact of modern day life that from time to time we\u2019ll lose dozens of people in seconds? That daily life is a lottery system? And if you can\u2019t say that, if it\u2019s just too cold and brutal a thought to bear, then isn\u2019t that proof you haven\u2019t solved the problem yet?\n\nHe continue: \u201cIf you\u2019re not at least trying to fix this, you\u2019re effectively telling the country in your (in)actions that this somehow acceptable. There\u2019s two moralities: morality identity and morality-in-action. Our greater moral identity doesn\u2019t match our actions so far.9) If you\u2019re not open minded to solving this, you\u2019re morally surrendering us all to a very certain fate. There is no in between here. **Please use the energy normally allotted to fighting this argument to rethinking this problem.** Unless you don\u2019t think there is one\u2026\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nBilly Eichner was likewise outspoken. After tweeting \u201cenough already\u201d in all caps, the Difficult People and American Horror Story: Cult star questioned why congress hasn\u2019t been pushed more on the matter since Sandy Hook.\n\nGUN CONTROL NOW. ENOUGH ALREADY. GROW THE FUCK UP. THE AVERAGE PERSON DOESN\u2019T NEED A FUCKING MACHINE GUN. ENOUGH ALREADY. ENOUGH. ENOUGH. \u2014 billy eichner (@billyeichner) October 2, 2017\n\nAND DON\u2019T TALK ABOUT THE 2ND AMENDMFNT. THEY WEREN\u2019T TALKING ABOUT AUTOMATIC WEAPONS & ANYONE WHO SAYS THAT NONSENSE IS ENABLING MASS MURDER \u2014 billy eichner (@billyeichner) October 2, 2017\n\nCongress did nothing after Sandy Hook. NOTHING. Think about how INSANE that is. We\u2019re calling Congress about everything else, why not this?? \u2014 billy eichner (@billyeichner) October 2, 2017\n\nLady Gaga shared a similar message, asking Democrats and Republicans to unite to bring an end to \u201cterrorism.\u201d She then directed a tweet towards Paul Ryan and Donald Trump, urging them to \u201cact quickly\u201d on gun control.\n\nThis is terrorism plain and simple. Terror bares no race, gender or religion. Democrats & Republicans please unite now #guncontrol ?? \u2014 xoxo, Gaga (@ladygaga) October 2, 2017\n\nPrayers are important but @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump blood is on the hands of those who have power to legislate. #GunControl act quickly. https://t.co/bXZQ7enuEp \u2014 xoxo, Gaga (@ladygaga) October 2, 2017\n\nEmmy Rossum, best known for playing the character Fiona Gallagher on Shameless, also tweeted at Trump calling for action.\n\nDear @realDonaldTrump, the people of Las Vegas don\u2019t need your hashtags and empty tweets about \u201cwarmest condolences\u201d. They need action. \u2014 Emmy Rossum (@emmyrossum) October 2, 2017\n\nI believe in prayer, but it\u2019s not enough by itself. We need better LAWS. In no world does a CIVILIAN need a MACHINE GUN. Let\u2019s fix this. \u2014 Emmy Rossum (@emmyrossum) October 2, 2017\n\nJohn Legend said the news was \u201cheartbreaking\u201d and \u201cdevastating\u201d in his own tweet before retweeting Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden on the need for gun control.\n\nThe crowd fled at the sound of gunshots. Imagine the deaths if the shooter had a silencer, which the NRA wants to make easier to get. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 2, 2017\n\nOur grief isn\u2019t enough. We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) October 2, 2017\n\nHow long do we let gun violence tear families apart? Enough. Congress & the WH should act now to save lives. There\u2019s no excuse for inaction. \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) October 2, 2017\n\nGaga\u2019s fellow pop star Ariana Grande, whose concert in Manchester, England earlier this year was the target of a bombing that killed 22 people, called for \u201clove, unity, peace, gun control.\u201d\n\nMy heart is breaking for Las Vegas. We need love, unity, peace, gun control & for people to look at this & call this what it is = terrorism. \u2014 Ariana Grande (@ArianaGrande) October 2, 2017\n\nMark Ruffalo (as well as Julianne Moore, in a similar message) encouraged everyone to join the movement to end gun violence by texting Everytown for Gun Safety, an organization that works with lawmakers to pass \u201ccommon-sense laws and policies that save lives.\u201d\n\nToday we mourn for Las Vegas, tomorrow we fight for them.\n\nJoin the movement to end gun violence: Text ACT to 64433. pic.twitter.com/yNmPeBjrFB \u2014 Mark Ruffalo (@MarkRuffalo) October 2, 2017\n\nTwo-time Olympian Aly Raisman said she was \u201cdisgusted\u201d by the news and questioned why it is \u201cso easy for crazy people to have guns.\u201d\n\nWHY is this horrible person allowed to have a gun? WHY. This has to stop. Why is it so easy for crazy people to have guns? I\u2019m disgusted. \u2014 Alexandra Raisman (@Aly_Raisman) October 2, 2017\n\nComedian Michael Ian Black called the National Rifle Association (NRA) a terrorist organization. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way to say it,\u201d he tweeted before responding to criticism.\n\nThe NRA is a terrorist organization.
