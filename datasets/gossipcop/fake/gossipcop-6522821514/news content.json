We had to stop seeing each other.\n\n\u201cI was no longer Caroline Flack, TV presenter, I was Caroline Flack, Prince Harry\u2019s bit of rough.\u201d\n\nWith Love Island returning to our screens in the coming months, we imagine Caroline might be \u201ctoo busy\u201d even if she did land an invite\u2026\n\nChelsy Davy \u2013 NFI\n\nChelsy, 32, returned to Africa to study while Harry focused on his army career and Royal duties.\n\nChelsy was Prince Harry\u2019s first love, after meeting through mutual pals in 2004She returned to the UK to take up a top job at a law firm and was seen accompanying Harry to a number of high-brow events, including his brother\u2019s wedding to Kate Middleton.\n\nThough that year brought an end to their romance, yet party animal Chelsy and Harry remain good friends.\n\nIf reports are to be believed, she hasn\u2019t been asked to Harry\u2019s evening do at Frogmore House, and is \u201csurprised\u201d, \u201cshocked\u201d and \u201ca little hurt\u201d.\n\nCressida Bonas \u2013 INVITED\n\nModel and actress Cressida, 28, was introduced to Harry by his cousin Princess Eugenie.\n\nThe pair shared a lust for life but still managed to keep their relationship relatively private, apart from moments when they were snapped off holidaying or partying at Glasto.\n\nShe allegedly called off their romance due to struggling with life in the spotlight while engagement rumours swirled, but the pair have remained on good terms.\n\nEugenie is also still pals with Cressy, and has invited her to her autumn wedding.\n\nWe can\u2019t imagine she\u2019ll recycle her frock from Harry\u2019s big day\u2026\n\nShe is now dating chartered surveyor Harry Wentworth-Stanley, and posted a loved-up snap on Instagram on his 29th birthday, describing him as \u201cmy love\u201d. Could wedding bells be on the cards for her, too?\n\nFlorence Brudenell-Bruce \u2013 NFI\n\nLingerie model Florence Brudenell-Bruce, 32, was spotted on Harry\u2019s arm in 2011, shortly after his split from Chelsy Davy.\n\nShe went on to marry multi-millionaire Henry St George in a romantic ceremony in the south of France, though her and the prince remain pals.\n\nSo, has she been invited? Well, she currently lives in the Bahamas and has a three-year-old to look after, so we\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty unlikely she\u2019ll be there on the big day.\n\nMollie King \u2013 NFI\n\nThe Saturdays singer caught Harry\u2019s eye in 2012 and the pair enjoyed a string of dates.\n\nWhen quizzed about the romance, Mollie said: \u201cYes, I have met Harry, and we did go out for a drink.\u201d\n\nAround the same time she publicly outed them, Harry reportedly called things off and Mollie went on to date supermodel David Gandy.\n\nAs far as we know, the Strictly Come Dancing semi-finalist hasn\u2019t been asked to sing (or dance) on the big day\u2026\n\nHere we reveal more of the special couple\u2019s wedding secrets.\n\nMeanwhile one mum reveals why Prince Harry shouldn\u2019t invite ANY exes to his wedding.\n\nAnd these are the wedding protocols Meghan and Harry will have to follow when they get married.", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000005369071.jpg?strip=all&w=689", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-1195.png?w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000348704677-e1526324639644.jpg?strip=all&w=658", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/newspress-collage-zq1enei5n-1763485180258.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1763485221&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000247204795-e1526325463842.jpg?strip=all&w=686", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TOB-18_11-kelly-brook-comp_182572.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000343580353.jpg?strip=all&w=707", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000242841961.jpg?strip=all&w=646", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dk-comp-harry-x.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000392824106.jpg?strip=all&w=873", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000372982717-e1526324407377.jpg?strip=all&w=543", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000404522652.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/newspress-collage-a35fvxmcd-1763495053729.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1763495070&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406084435-e1526324493132.jpg?strip=all&w=632", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000242842367.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dk-comp-harry-x.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/6286606/prince-harrys-exes-invited-royal-wedding/", "title": "Prince Harry\u2019s exes: who\u2019s invited and who hasn't made the cut to the wedding of the year", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
