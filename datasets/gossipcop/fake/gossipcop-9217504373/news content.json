It is known Prince Harry had high profile relationships with Chelsy Davy, 32, and Cressida Bonas, 29, before he began dating Meghan in 2016. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT However, a royal expert has said no previous romantic interest had ever \u201ctamed\u201d Harry in the way that Meghan has done. \u201cI think Meghan has had a really positive influence on Harry,\u201d Katie Nicholl, author of Harry Life Loss and Love told Express.co.uk exclusively. \u201cHistorically Harry has always been \u2018tamed\u2019 by his girlfriends, we saw that with Chelsy and Cressida, but I think Meghan\u2019s had a bigger influence on him than any other woman.\u201d Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeghan Markle is said to have tamed Prince Harry more than his previous ex girlfriends\n\nKatie went into further detail about the ways in which Meghan had \u201ctamed\u201d the prince. The changes include curbing Harry\u2019s unhealthy habits \u2013 a change which has apparently caused him to be the laughing stock of friends. \u201cHis friends laugh about the fact that he\u2019s now into juicing and yoga.\u201d However, it seems Prince Harry does not take the teasing to heart: \u201cHe seems so happy and content and that\u2019s all down to Meghan,\u201d Katie told Express.co.uk. \u201cHe also drinks a lot less these days and he\u2019s even cut back on smoking to please her. \u201cI wouldn't be surprised if he had actually quit smoking for Meghan.\n\nGetty Meghan Markle: She has tamed Prince Harry more than his exes Cressida and Chelsy, it is said\n\nGetty Meghan Markle: Prince Harry previously dated Cressida Bonas\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s definitely healthier for being with her and one of the first things she did when she moved into Harry\u2019s home, Nottingham Cottage, was clear out all the junk food from the cupboards.\u201d Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT Meghan leads by example, Katie suggested, and her lifestyle has influenced Harry. \u201cMeghan\u2019s a bit of a health food fanatic and that\u2019s definitely rubbed off on Harry.\u201d Yesterday, it was revealed that Meghan Markle and her father have fallen out. A palace insider has cast doubt on whether or not Thomas Markle Sr will attend the wedding, after revealing a shocking rift between father and daughter.\n\nGetty Meghan Markle: She will marry Prince
