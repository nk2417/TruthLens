Then, in 1998, she earned her master's degree in fine arts from the American Conservatory Theater.\n\nActing Career\n\nUpon getting serious about acting and joining the Screen Actors Guild, Banks changed her name to the one we know today, since there was already an Elizabeth Mitchell on the SAG rolls. Later that same year, Banks made her on-screen debut in the independent film \"Surrender Dorothy.\" A few years after that, she landed a small but memorable part in 2001's \"Wet Hot American Summer,\" directed by David Wain and starring a cast of many future stars, including Bradley Cooper.

In \"Call Jane,\" she played a 1960s housewife who joins a covert network helping women access safe abortions. In the comedy-drama \"The Beanie Bubble,\" she played a key figure in the rise of the Beanie Babies craze, and voiced the lead character Pam Mallard in the animated family film \"Migration.\"\n\nShe starred in \"A Mistake\" as a skilled surgeon whose life and career are disrupted after a fatal operating room error, and in the psychological thriller \"Skincare,\" she played a celebrity facialist whose glamorous world conceals darker truths. In the Prime Video mystery series \"The Better Sister,\" she took on the role of one of two estranged siblings grappling with the fallout from a murder investigation. She also led the cast of \"The Miniature Wife,\" a romantic sci-fi comedy in which a technological experiment upends a couple's dynamic when the husband accidentally shrinks his wife.\n\nDirecting Career\n\nWhile continuing to act in a variety of films and television series, Banks steadily built a reputation as a skilled director. After helming the hit sequel \"Pitch Perfect 2\" in 2015, which became the highest-grossing musical comedy of all time at its release, she returned to direct \"Pitch Perfect 3\" in 2017. In 2019, she directed and starred in a reboot of \"Charlie's Angels,\" reimagining the iconic franchise for a new generation. Her earlier directorial credits included the short film \"Just a Little Heart Attack\" and a segment of the comedy anthology \"Movie 43.\"\n\nHer most talked-about directorial effort came with the 2023 release of \"Cocaine Bear,\" a dark comedy thriller inspired by a real-life incident involving a bear and a drug smuggling operation gone wrong. The film's offbeat tone, genre mash-up, and surprising box office success affirmed Banks' skill behind the camera.\n\nIn addition to directing, Banks expanded her influence as a producer through Brownstone Productions. She produced the satirical high school comedy \"Bottoms,\" a story about two queer teens who start a fight club to impress cheerleaders. She also produced and starred in the thriller \"Skincare\" and the comedy series \"The Miniature Wife,\" continuing to merge her creative and business talents across mediums.\n\nMiscellaneous Work\n\nBanks has a few video game credits stemming from her work in the \"Spider-Man\" and \"LEGO\" movies, as well as a voice role in Legoland Florida's \"The LEGO Movie: 4D \u2013 A New Adventure.\" She's also appeared in a handful of music videos, including \"Girls Like You\" by Maroon 5 feat.

In 2018, they paid $6.85 million for a custom-built gated 1-acre hilltop property in nearby Sherman Oaks.\n\nBrownstone Productions\n\nElizabeth Banks and her husband, sportswriter and producer Max Handelman, co-founded Brownstone Productions in 2002 with the goal of developing character-driven, commercially appealing stories across film, television, and digital media. What began as a boutique production outfit quickly evolved into a formidable force in Hollywood, thanks in large part to the breakout success of the \"Pitch Perfect\" franchise.\n\nBrownstone's first major triumph came with \"Pitch Perfect,\" which became a sleeper hit in 2012 and laid the groundwork for a multi-film series that combined musical comedy with smart, female-led storytelling. Banks not only starred in the films but helped guide their creative direction behind the scenes.

Under Banks and Handelman's leadership, the company expanded its footprint with a range of projects spanning genres\u2014from horror-comedy to action to romantic drama\u2014while maintaining a consistent commitment to bold, offbeat storytelling.\n\nIn the years that followed, Brownstone continued to produce high-profile projects, including \"Charlie's Angels\" (2019), \"Cocaine Bear\"
