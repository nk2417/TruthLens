Ron Hubbard's rules.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\"Everyone must learn to say nothing within the expectant mother's hearing using labor and delivery,\" Hubbard wrote before his death.\n\n\"Particularly during birth, absolute silence must be maintained and the more gentle the delivery, the better.\"\n\nPost-divorce dating rule\n\nView 7 Images Tom's divorce terms reportedly stated that Katie wasn't allowed to publicly date anyone for five years after their split (Image: <P>Pictured: Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes<P><B>Ref: SPL189747 210610 </B><BR/>Picture by: Jackson Lee / Splash News<BR/></P><P><B>Splash News and Pictures</B>...)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nAccording to the terms of their 'quickie' divorce, Katie was reportedly not allowed to mention their marriage or date anyone publicly for five years after her split from Tom.\n\nA source told Radar last year: \"She's allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she's not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri.\"\n\nAgreeing to the clause reportedly netted Katie \u00a33.6million in child support and \u00a33.8million for herself.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nThat was on top of the \u00a340million prenuptial agreement Katie drew up with the help of her lawyer father, in which she pocketed \u00a32million for every year of their five-year marriage as well as a trust fund for 11-year-old Suri.\n\n7 View 7 Images Tom holding Katie's hand while her future boyfriend Jamie Foxx watches on in 2006 (Image: Reuters) 7 View 7 Images Katie got full custody of Suri when she fled her marriage (Image: XPOSUREPHOTOS.COM)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe settlement also reportedly contained \u201ciron-clad\u201d rulings that Suri would not be made a member of the controversial Church of Scientology, where Tom holds a high rank.\n\nAnd this week - not long after the five-year mark had passed since Katie filed for divorce on June 29 2012 - she finally went public with Jamie Foxx.", "images": ["https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article601539.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/70257eed-0c16-4058-97e3-9fdddf828dff.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/trust-project.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article588296.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/e5e135cb-f5c7-4d9e-a1c9-630d67fb599f.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article945970.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Tom Cruise and a pregnant Katie Holmes at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201510/2493/4221396001_4588813544001_4588811177001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article601736.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/dae6cc19-ce80-4dde-8b33-484e72349be3a.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article7739334.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Suri-Cruise-and-Katie-Holmes.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article676411.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/CELEBRITY PDA katie holmes.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/nav-web-static/release-v41-14493b7c888038a7d89b99cb3a7937c2b71eaebe/public/logo-reach.png", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/ipso.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11121308.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Actors-Cruise-Holmes-and-Foxx-watch-before-the-Redskins-and-Minnesota-game-in-Landover.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article588294.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/f9c9a16e-06b8-4660-a822-a3244b813f96.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/assets/mirror/logos/masthead-mirror-default.svg"], "top_img": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article601736.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/dae6cc19-ce80-4dde-8b33-484e72349be3a.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/weird-marriage-rules-tom-cruise-11126495", "title": "Weird marriage rules Tom Cruise imposed on Katie Holmes: 'Silence during labour' and 'no public dating' after their split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"page_id": 6149699161, "app_id": 123792601022133, "pages": 1814357575554395}, "description": "TomKat split back in 2012 after Katie grew wary of Tom's interest in Scientology", "author": "Emmeline Saunders", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "Googlebot-News": "noarchive", "referrer": "unsafe-URL", "keywords": "Church of Scientology, Mimi Rogers, Katie Holmes, Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Divorce", "news_keywords": "Church of Scientology, Mimi Rogers, Katie Holmes, Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Divorce", "allowTaboolaDeepDive": "true", "vf": {"00000000-0000-4000-8000-67e599051dc3": "mirror-prod-11126495"}, "og": {"title": "Inside the weird marriage rules Tom Cruise imposed on Katie Holmes", "description": "TomKat split back in 2012 after Katie grew wary of Tom's interest in Scientology", "url": "http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/weird-marriage-rules-tom-cruise-11126495", "site_name": "Daily Mirror", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article601736.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/dae6cc19-ce80-4dde-8b33-484e72349be3a.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-07T11:43:00Z", "modified_time": "2017-09-07T18:04:03Z", "author": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/emmeline-saunders/", "section": "Celebrity News", "tag": "Divorce"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@DailyMirror", "creator": "@emm_saunders", "title": "Weird marriage rules Tom Cruise imposed on Katie Holmes: 'Silence during labour' and 'no public dating' after their split -
