But despite all of the messiness, it appears as though Blac Chyna is happy for Kim and Kanye\u2019s new baby\u2014even though Chyna sued Kim Kardashian for \u201cdestroying her career.\u201d\n\nThe messiness goes as far back as when Kylie Jenner used to date Tyga\u2014Chyna was Tyga\u2019s ex, with whom she has a child, and reports of Kylie and Tyga stepping out together started surfacing uncomfortably close to when Tyga and Chyna broke up. It created a tense situation for everyone involved. In 2016, Chyna began dating Rob Kardashian and soon became pregnant. The Kardashian family seemed to try and mostly succeeded in warming up to her.\n\nLess than a year after their child was born, the couple broke up after Rob publicly posted revenge porn photos of Blac Chyna on his Instagram and Twitter. They promptly separated, but ever since then the two families have been embroiled in a tense legal battle that revolved around Chyna suing the Kardshains for \u201cdestroying her career so she would not compete with them.\u201d In November, Blac Chyna removed every Kardashian from her lawsuit over her and Rob\u2019s canceled reality show except Kim, Rob, and Kris Jenner.\n\nBut today, photographers from The Blast spotted Chyna running some errands in Los Angeles and decided to ask her if she has any feelings about Kim and Kanye\u2019s new baby, who was born via surrogate earlier this week. Chyna\u2019s response was much kinder and more subdued than some might have predicted.\n\n\"Are you happy about Kim and Kanye having a kid? A baby girl,\u201d the reporter asked. Chyna smiled and responded, \u201cIt\u2019s always a blessing.\u201d She then said something else, which The Blast reported as: \u201cThey deserve blessings.\u201d However, it\u2019s hard to hear exactly what she says. E! News reported her as saying \u201cbabies are blessings.\u201d\n\nThe legal case between Chyna and Rob is still ongoing.", "images": ["https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,c_fill,ar_1.55,w_2048,g_auto/v1723865945/sanity-new/blac-chyna-133503027.jpg", "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723865946/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-1586-1670474420-29_16x9-6485517"], "top_img": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723865946/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-1586-1670474420-29_16x9-6485517", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/julia-pimentel/blac-chyna-says-kim-kardashian-new-baby-is-a-blessing", "title": "Blac Chyna Says Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's New Baby ...", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Blac Chyna puts drama aside, calling Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's new baby a blessing.", "og": {"title": "Blac Chyna Says Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's New Baby ...", "description": "Blac Chyna puts drama aside, calling Kim Kardashian and K...", "url": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/julia-pimentel/blac-chyna-says-kim-kardashian-new-baby-is-a-blessing", "site_name": "Complex", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723865946/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-1586-1670474420-29_16x9-6485517", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "@complex", "id": 13049362}, "title": "Blac Chyna Says Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's New ...", "description": "Blac Chyna puts drama aside, calling Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's new baby a blessing.", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723865946/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-1586-1670474420-29_16x9-6485517"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.complex.com", "summary": ""}
