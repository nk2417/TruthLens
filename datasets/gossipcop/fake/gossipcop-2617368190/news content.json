But as she revealed, the role isn\u2019t in the cards, so much so that she hasn\u2019t even heard about the part.\n\n\u201cI love that!\u201d Gomez revealed. \u201cThat\u2019s new information for me. No, that\u2019s a rumor.\u201d\n\nWhile most know Gomez now for her music career, she actually got her start starring in Disney Channel\u2019s Wizards of Waverly Place. This, combined with her working relationship with Netflix on 13 Reasons Why, made many of her fans suggest that she should play the new Sabrina Spellman. But as Gomez explained, she doesn\u2019t plan to return to the realm of television witchcraft anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve done my magic enough,\u201d Gomez added.\n\nThe Sabrina reboot was first announced earlier this year, with many eagerly trying to predict who would land the title role. Early reports have suggested that the casting call for Sabrina is open ethnicity, and that her relationship with both Harvey Kinkle and her aunts will come into play.\n\nThe series will also serve as a spinoff of The CW\u2019s hit series Riverdale, leaving the door open for crossovers during the line. And as Riverdale and Sabrina showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa explained, there will be a bit of a shared supernatural aura between the two.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no secret that I love that character, and that that character is a huge part of the Archie universe,\u201d Aguirre-Sacasa told ComicBook.com after Riverdale\u2018s season one finale. \u201cThe show kind of has hints of the supernatural throughout it; there are visions of Jason as a ghost, as a zombie. Archie sees werewolves. There\u2019s a lot of talk about angry, pagan gods and there\u2019s a voodoo doll. We are going to continue exploring the idea of the supernatural being on the fringes of Riverdale, and that might be to lead up to Sabrina\u2019s arrival or that might just be to make it more like Twin Peaks and the way they dealt with the supernatural.\u201d\n\nSabrina will premiere on Netflix sometime in 2018.", "images": ["https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/Blooming-Love-Shonen-Jump.jpg?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-KpNhwJ0RxTQPU.gif", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/10/ComicBook-logo_40a31d.png", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/more-recent-sci-fi-movies.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/the-good-place.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/Netflix-Logo-N.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/Dexter-Resurrection-Suit.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/Cartoon-Network-Studios-Logo.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/zodiac-streaming-netflix.jpg?w=300", "http://comicbook.com/wp-content/themes/comicbook-2024/assets/images/comicbook-logo-white.png", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/Ubisoft-Logo.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/eb9b8d3d-fe15-45d5-ab1e-bc17074dabe4.png?w=1200"], "top_img": "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/eb9b8d3d-fe15-45d5-ab1e-bc17074dabe4.png?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Anderson", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/chilling-adventures-of-sabrina-netflix-tv-show-selena-gomez/", "title": "Selena Gomez Responds to \u2018Sabrina\u2019 Casting Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Selena Gomez Responds to 'Sabrina' Casting Rumors", "description": "Netflix is set to bring Archie Horror\u2018s Chilling Adventures of Sabrina to the small screen, but it looks like one former teenage witch won\u2019t be a part of it.
