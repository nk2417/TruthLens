But there was still one looming introduction that gave Meghan Markle pause. A friend says the Toronto-based Suits actress was \u201ca little nervous\u201d at the thought of meeting boyfriend Prince Harry\u2019s beloved grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nAnd though it had taken Duchess Kate five years to score face time with the 91-year-old monarch (they chatted at a 2008 royal family wedding), Markle knew she would be curtseying to Her Majesty before year\u2019s end. \u201cHe\u2019s keen to make an introduction,\u201d a Harry pal said this spring. \u201cIt will happen when it\u2019s the right time.\u201d\n\nThat perfect moment came September 3. Fresh off their three-week vacation in Botswana and Zambia \u2014 a getaway one source dubbed \u201cthe trip of a lifetime\u201d \u2014 the royal whisked 36-year-old Markle 500-plus miles north from his two-bedroom Kensington Palace flat. With his dad Prince Charles and stepmother Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall staying at Birkhall, their 53,000-acre estate in Aberdeenshire, Scotland, \u201cHarry decided to take Meghan to visit as he hadn\u2019t been up yet all summer,\u201d a Harry source explains in the new issue of Us Weekly.\n\nAnother motivation for the two-day trip, says the source: \u201cHe wanted to introduce Meghan to the queen.\u201d So 24 hours after they arrived September 2, the duo popped over to Balmoral Castle, the queen\u2019s summer residence, seven miles away. \u201cIt went well,\u201d says the source. \u201cIt\u2019ll no doubt be the first of many encounters.\u201d\n\nThe next could involve the logistics of a royal wedding. While a source says Harry intended to propose during the African holiday \u2014 he created a ring using diamonds from a brooch that once belonged to his mom, Princess Diana \u2014 another insider says the former Apache helicopter pilot, 33, \u201cwouldn\u2019t tell anyone for a while.\u201d Keeping his desire for secrecy in mind, select palace aides have already begun preparations for making an engagement proclamation. \u201cThese things are planned well in advance; it\u2019s not easy to roll out that kind of news,\u201d explains the source. \u201cEveryone knows how happy Harry is and is excited for the day it\u2019s announced.\u201d\n\nFor now, the pair are reveling in a triumphant visit. \u201cThe entire weekend was a success,\u201d declares the source. For Harry, notes the source, \u201che was able to introduce someone he loves to someone he cares for deeply.\u201d\n\nRelated: 15 Charming Throwback Photos of the Royal Family Us Weekly rounds up 15 charming throwback photos of the British royal family from the '80s and '90s \u2014 see unexpectedly adorable and silly pics of Prince William and Prince Harry here\n\nAnd the L.A.-born actress received rave reviews. Though the source notes much has been made about the fact that Markle is a commoner, raised by clinical therapist Doria Ragland and former Married. . . With Children lighting director Tom, \u201cshe fits perfectly into the family,\u201d says the source. \u201cThe difference in backgrounds means absolutely nothing.\u201d The Northwestern University theater and international studies double major, wed briefly to talent manager Trevor Engelson, \u201cgets on fabulously with Charles,\u201d says the source, \u201cas do she and Camilla.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s her chemistry with Harry. The actress declared in Vanity Fair\u2019s October issue, \u201cWe\u2019re two people who are really happy and in love.\u201d And their ardor has only increased since their romantic holiday. \u201cMeghan and Harry are in such a good place \u2014 Africa took their relationship to a whole other level,\u201d says the source. \u201cThey\u2019re just crazy about each other.\u201d\n\nFor more
