The next day he told me with a big smile on his face, \u2018I really enjoyed last night,'\u201d Gotterba told the Enquirer.\n\nDouglas Gotterba in undated photo\n\nHe said Travolta, 58, took him on more romantic trips to Hawaii, Amsterdam and Kenya.\n\n\u201cSometimes he\u2019d bring women along as beards, but he would ask me to join him in his suite and we\u2019d spend the nights together. It was our little secret,\u201d Gotterba claimed.\n\nThe pilot said he encouraged Travolta to get a girlfriend as cover, and that\u2019s when the actor started dating Brooke Shields.\n\n\u201cThere was no chemistry between them. They\u2019d smile for the cameras and everyone assumed they were a couple,\u201d he said.\n\nThe affair ended in 1986 after growing tensions, Gotterba said.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d show up on my door many times, unannounced, to check up on me,\u201d the pilot told the Enquirer. \u201cHe\u2019d disappear into my bedroom and go through my drawers. He always tried to catch me cheating on him.\u201d\n\nHe said Travolta would ignore him for days if he didn\u2019t drop everything to be with him on a moment\u2019s notice.\n\nTheir last meeting was years later in 1992, after Travolta married actress Kelly Preston.\n\n\u201cWe were making small talk when suddenly, I blurted out, \u2018So, John, tell me. Now that you\u2019re married, do you still prefer men \u2013 or women?'\u201d Gotterba said he asked. \u201cWell, Doug, I still prefer men,\u201d Travolta replied, according to Gotterba.\n\nThe Enquirer report follows three months after two anonymous masseurs \u2013 John Does 1 and 2 \u2013 filed and later dropped federal lawsuits claiming Travolta groped them during massages.\n\nThe first Doe withdrew his legal claim after Travolta proved he was in New York on the day of the alleged Beverly Hills attack.\n\nTravolta\u2019s camp immediately dismissed the Enquirer\u2019s interview with Gotterba.\n\n\u201cThis ridiculous so-called \u2018new\u2019 story is a retread of a story published a few weeks ago by the same desperate supermarket tabloid \u2013 the same tabloid that impossibly claimed that John Travolta had an encounter with \u2018Doe #1\u2019 in Beverly Hills when he was actually on the east coast working on a movie,\u201d Travolta\u2019s rep said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nndillon@nydailynews.com", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2014/07/23/CZEER67GNSE73MSTZZIRW3FQ74.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2014/07/23/CZEER67GNSE73MSTZZIRW3FQ74.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nancy Dillon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2014/07/23/john-travolta-had-six-year-gay-affair-with-me-california-pilot-doug-gotterba-alleges-in-report-that-actors-camp-calls-ridiculous/", "title": "John Travolta had six-year gay affair with me, California pilot Doug Gotterba alleges in report that actor\u2019s camp calls \u2018ridiculous\u2019", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Nancy Dillon", "canonical": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2014/07/23/john-travolta-had-six-year-gay-affair-with-me-california-pilot-doug-gotterba-alleges-in-report-that-actors-camp-calls-ridiculous/"}, "description": "The California pilot who claims he had a high-flying gay affair with actor John Travolta is airing new details about their alleged six-year relationship.
