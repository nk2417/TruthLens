ABC quickly identified and corrected the errors. We apologize to the Academy, press, and fans for any confusion.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAdams was inadvertently named one of the nominees for best actress for her work as linguist Louise Banks in Denis Villeneuve\u2019s sci-fi film \u201cArrival.\u201d It would have been her sixth Oscar nomination.\n\nAdams was thought to be a shoo-in, but may have seen her support eroded by also being in contention for \u201cNocturnal Animals.\u201d The actual nominees were Isabelle Huppert for \u201cElle,\u201d Ruth Negga for \u201cLoving,\u201d Natalie Portman for \u201cJackie,\u201d Emma Stone for \u201cLa La Land,\u201d and Meryl Streep for \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins.\u201d\n\nBening was incorrectly listed in the same category for the comedy-drama \u201c20th Century Women.\u201d It would have been her fifth nomination.\n\nHanks was listed incorrectly as one of the nominees for best actor for his role as Capt. Chesley Sullenberger in Clint Eastwood\u2019s biographic action-drama \u201cSully,\u201d about how Sullenberger successfully landing a disabled jet airplane on the Hudson River in 2009. It would have been Hanks\u2019 sixth nomination in the category, which he won for \u201cForrest Gump\u201d and \u201cPhiladelphia.\u201d\n\nHanks was viewed as something of a longshot for a nomination for \u201cSully,\u201d which was a box office success. Nominations went to Casey Affleck for \u201cManchester by the Sea,\u201d Andrew Garfield for \u201cHacksaw Ridge,\u201d Ryan Gosling for \u201cLa La Land,\u201d Viggo Mortensen for \u201cCaptain Fantastic,\u201d and Denzel Washington for \u201cFences.\u201d", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/sully-9.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/sully-9.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Mcnary", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/film/awards/oscars-abc-apologizes-amy-adams-tom-hanks-oscar-nominees-1201968336/", "title": "ABC Apologizes for Incorrectly Listing Amy Adams, Tom Hanks as Oscar Nominees", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "ABC Digital has issued an apology for mistakenly listing Amy Adams and Tom Hanks as Oscar nominees.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Dave McNary", "tags": "amy adams, Oscars, Tom Hanks", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "ABC Apologizes for Incorrectly Listing Amy Adams, Tom Hanks as Oscar Nominees", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/film/awards/oscars-abc-apologizes-amy-adams-tom-hanks-oscar-nominees-1201968336/", "description": "ABC Digital has issued an apology for mistakenly listing Amy Adams and Tom Hanks as Oscar nominees.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/sully-9.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Sully Movie"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-01-24T16:41:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-01-25T00:36:11+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "ABC Digital has issued an apology for mistakenly listing Amy Adams and Tom Hanks as Oscar nominees.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@Variety_DMcNary", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "ABC Apologizes for Incorrectly Listing Amy Adams, Tom Hanks as Oscar Nominees", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/sully-9.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1485276097.0, "source": "http://variety.com", "summary": ""}
