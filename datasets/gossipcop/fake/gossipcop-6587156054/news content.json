And it took me about four or five seconds. And she said, \u2018It\u2019s Jennifer! It\u2019s Jennifer!\u2019 I go, \u2018Oh my God, Jennifer, you look beautiful.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMichael Rozman/Warner Bros.\n\nAlex Rodriguez\n\nRodriguez continued, \u201cI was so embarrassed and then I got a little nervous, and I\u2019m like, \u2018This is so goofy.\u2019 We all know who Jennifer is and she\u2019s everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she says, \u2018You have my number, reach out,\u2019 \u201d he explained. \u201cAnd I went home that night and reached out.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres disputed the story, though, explaining that Lopez shared a different account during an appearance on the talk show last year. Still, the 48-year-old singer\u2019s version of events is pretty similar.\n\nLopez told Vanity Fair in the magazine\u2019s December cover story that she saw the baseball star walk by while having lunch and decided to approach him.\n\n\u201cI could literally just have walked away,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I walk over and tap him on the shoulder and say \u2018Hey.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLopez added, \u201cI had just come from a promo for my show, Shades of Blue, so I\u2019m dressed like my character, like a boy \u2014 Timberlands, jeans, curly short hair. He looks at me. I say, \u2018It\u2019s Jennifer.\u2019 He says, \u2018You look so beautiful.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWant to keep up with the latest from PEOPLE?

On May 21, 2005, Lopez met Rodriguez while attending a Yankees game alongside her then-husband Marc Anthony.\n\nAs both teams geared up to play some ball at Shea Stadium in Queens, Lopez was snapped shaking hands with Rodriguez. She and Anthony \u2014 who was scheduled to throw out the first pitch at the Subway Series Game \u2014 also posed for a photo with the sportsman, who was married at the time to Cynthia Scurtis (the pair split in 2008).\n\nSplashNews\n\nJennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez and Marc Anthony in 2005\n\nMike Ehrmann/WireImage\n\nRecently opening up in the April Harper\u2019s BAZAAR cover story, Lopez revealed she\u2019s in no rush to walk down the aisle with her boyfriend of over a year.\n\n\u201cI do believe in marriage, and I would love to grow old with somebody in a committed relationship,\u201d the star told the outlet. \u201cBut I\u2019m not forcing anything right now.\u201d\n\nKevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nThe couple have been candid about blending their families \u2014 Lopez\u2019s 10-year-old twins Max and Emme and Rodriguez\u2019s daughters (with Scurtis) Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9 \u2014 making it known that their priorities lie with their children\u2019s best interests.\n\nIn fact, the former New York Yankee\u2019s daughters were a huge fan of Lopez from the get-go. \u201cShe is such a great role model. They look at her like she\u2019s the Messiah,\u201d Rodriguez told PEOPLE exclusively in October of Ella and Natasha.\n\nHe added, \u201cWhen they\u2019re in Las Vegas, I don\u2019t think they leave Jennifer\u2019s side.\u201d", "images":
