In an interview with The New York Times, Glaze said the kiss made him \"uncomfortable immediately\" and that he wished it could have been saved for his first relationship. He later clarified his comments to ET, calling the kiss \"harmless.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that stuff like that turns into a story that big,\u201d Bryan said on The Morning Show. \u201cI watched an actual interview where Ben, the kid that was involved, said that he was cool with everything.\u201d\n\n\"I gotta back Katy on that. She\u2019s in there working hard and making fun TV,\" he continued.\n\nBryan did admit that he, Perry and Lionel Richie aren't perfect, saying, \"We are going to get it right sometimes and get it wrong sometimes.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re in there critiquing people. I may say something one day that everybody\u2019s not going to like. That\u2019s just what you signed up for,\u201d he shared. \u201cAt the end of the day, me and Lionel and Katy and Ryan [Seacrest], our hearts are in the right place.\u201d\n\nIn Glaze's interview with ET, he said he didn't think Perry \"had any malicious intent\" by kissing him before his audition.\n\n\"Honestly it was show business. It was just kind of fun and games,\" he said. \"Obviously it's gotten a huge amount of publicity, and I am more thankful for that than not.\"\n\n\"Before that, I had never kissed a girl, so I don't have anything to compare it to, to be honest,\" Glaze continued, guessing he'd rate the kiss at a \"seven.\" \"She seemed like she knew what she was doing.\"\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/147800_0859.jpg?h=c6980913", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/147800_0859.jpg?h=c6980913&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-03/147801_6589.jpg?h=c6980913&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-03/et_b01_idolconsant_031518.png?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-03/katy_perry_american_idol_180318_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/147800_0859.jpg?h=c6980913", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/luke-bryan-says-katy-perrys-american-idol-kiss-was-just-fun-tv-98712", "title": "Luke Bryan Says Katy Perry's 'American Idol' Kiss Was Just 'Fun TV'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/147800_0859.jpg?h=c6980913", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 41-year-old singer has his fellow judge's back.", "title": "Luke Bryan Says Katy Perry's 'American Idol' Kiss Was Just 'Fun TV'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/luke-bryan-says-katy-perrys-american-idol-kiss-was-just-fun-tv-98712", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 41-year-old singer has his fellow judge's back.", "twitter": {"description": "The 41-year-old singer has his fellow judge's back.", "title": "Luke Bryan Says Katy Perry's 'American Idol' Kiss Was Just 'Fun TV'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/luke-bryan-says-katy-perrys-american-idol-kiss-was-just-fun-tv-98712", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/147800_0859.jpg?h=c6980913", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Luke Bryan Says Katy Perry's 'American Idol' Kiss Was Just 'Fun TV' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, American Idol, Luke Bryan, Katy Perry", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
