You wouldn\u2019t believe it. It was about (meeting) his daughter. He phoned up our manager and we were asleep.\n\nTrump then proceeded to throw the entire band out of the hotel, and even refused to let them leave through a secret exit.\n\nPayne continued: \u201cHe said \u2018well, wake them up\u2019 and I was like \u2018no\u2019 and then he wouldn\u2019t let us use the underground garage. Obviously, in New York, we can\u2019t really go outside. New York is ruthless for us. So he was like, \u2018OK, then I don\u2019t want you in my hotel.\u2019 So we had to leave.\u201d\n\nOne Direction are currently on an extended hiatus with each member currently enjoying solo careers; Payne's first record will be released later this year.\n\nPayne's fellow bandmate Niall Horan recently promised fans that the band would 'definitely' reunite one day in the future.", "images": ["http://www.independent.co.uk/img/logo-white-out.svg", "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/18/09/donald-trump-press-conference.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/18/09/donald-trump-press-conference.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/18/09/donald-trump-press-conference.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/donald-trump-one-direction-liam-payne-kicked-out-of-hotel-daughter-ivanka-tiffany-a7636451.html", "title": "Donald Trump kicked One Direction out of his hotel for refusing to meet his daughter", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/music/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "The band were sleeping when the future president called the band's hotel room", "og": {"updated_time": "2017-03-18T17:24:15.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Donald Trump kicked One Direction out of his hotel for an unbelievable reason", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/news/donald-trump-one-direction-liam-payne-kicked-out-of-hotel-daughter-ivanka-tiffany-a7636451.html", "type": "article", "description": "The band were sleeping when the future president called the band's hotel room", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/18/09/donald-trump-press-conference.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/18/09/donald-trump-press-conference.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-03-18T17:24:15.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-03-18T17:24:15.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Music", "author_name": "Jacob Stolworthy", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 311, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 2, "external_link_count": 1}, "date": "2017-03-18T17:24:15.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176299319"}, "twitter": {"title": "Donald Trump kicked One Direction out of his hotel for an unbelievable reason", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The band were sleeping when the future president called the band's hotel room", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/03/18/09/donald-trump-press-conference.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Donald Trump\",\"One Direction\",\"Liam Payne\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1489857855.0, "source": "http://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
