As Jolie explained to NBC News in 2011, \u201cI\u2019m trying to raise [the children] to \u2026 really live a truly global [life].\u201d\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie: The Way They Were From Mr. and Mrs. Smith to Mr. and Mrs. Pitt! Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have had quite the journey from costars, to parents, to spouses.

But the couple, who are parents to six kids, has built a long-lasting relationship. Click through to see their romantic history.\n\nPitt, 52, grew to resent the peripatetic existence. As far back as 2009, a source told Us at the time, Pitt wanted to enroll the kids in one school in New Orleans, while Jolie preferred homeschooling to allow them to continue their travels. \u201cBrad wants them to have a normal upbringing and worries that they\u2019ll come out spoiled, elitist and not grounded,\u201d the source said at the time. \u201cBut Angie feels they should be \u2018children of the world.\u2019 They argue about it all the time: heated, screaming fights.\u201d\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Hollywood\u2019s Ugliest Divorces Throughout their time in the spotlight, some A-listers \u2014 including Brad Pitt, Britney Spears, Madonna and Tom Cruise, among others \u2014 have found themselves involved in pretty messy divorces.

But according to a Jolie friend, Pitt was too strict for his wife\u2019s liking. \u201c[He] became a big yeller,\u201d claims the source. \u201cAnd she would not tolerate him yelling at the kids. There were a few times Angie said she was terrified.\u201d\n\nThe War Machine actor, raised in a conservative household in Springfield, Missouri, was stern but never abusive, says a source who has worked with the family. \u201cWhen he raises his voice and yells at the kids, it\u2019s almost comical,\u201d says the source. \u201cHe\u2019s not one of those guys with a temper. He\u2019s not a drill sergeant.\u201d\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Brangelina\u2019s Most Memorable Red Carpet Appearances Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie announced their split on September 20, 2016 \u2014 take a look back at their most memorable red carpet moments of all time\n\nAt the skate park he had installed at the Los Feliz home, Pitt would often play with the kids.

He might say, \u2018How come nobody did this?\u2019 or \u2018Why didn\u2019t this get done?\u2019\u201d\n\nPitt was also a stickler when it came to bedtimes. Says the source, \u201cHe might get upset if the kids stay up too late playing video games.\u201d Structure and order, adds another Pitt source, were important to him: \u201cBrad teaches them to be respectful human beings. Angelina lets the kids run around and behave badly.\u201d\n\nThe disagreements ultimately doomed the couple. Jolie filed for divorce on September 19 and requested full physical custody of the children. Their split, admits a Pitt source, \u201ccame down to differences in lifestyle and parenting.\u201d\n\nFor much more on Jolie and Pitt\u2019s bitter split, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on
