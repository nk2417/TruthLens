Recognised with four Grammy Awards,[3] he has also received 15 Academy of Country Music Awards, including the Jim Reeves International Award,[4] 13 CMA Awards, and six ARIA Music Awards. Urban wrote and performed the song \"For You\" from the film Act of Valor, which earned him nominations at both the 70th Golden Globe Awards and at the 18th Critics' Choice Awards in the respective Best Original Song categories.[5]\n\nUrban has released a total of 12 studio albums (one of which was released only in Australia), as well as one album with his short-lived backing band the Ranch. He has charted 37 singles on the US Hot Country Songs chart, 18 of which went to number one, counting a duet with Brad Paisley (\"Start a Band\") and the 2008 single \"You Look Good in My Shirt\". Urban also worked with numerous artists from different music genres, such as Pink, Nelly Furtado, Jason Derulo, Julia Michaels, and Peter Frampton, as well as country artists like Dolly Parton, The Chicks, Carrie Underwood, Martina McBride, Eric Church, and Reba McEntire.\n\nBorn in New Zealand, Urban immigrated to Australia as a child. In 1991, he released a self-titled debut album, charting four singles in Australia before moving to the United States the next year. He began a band known as The Ranch, which recorded one studio album on Capitol Nashville and charted two singles on the US Billboard Hot Country Songs chart.\n\nStill signed to Capitol, Urban made his solo American debut in 1999 with a second eponymous album. Certified platinum in the US by the RIAA, it produced his first number one on the Hot Country Songs chart with \"But for the Grace of God\". \"Somebody Like You\", the first single from his second Capitol album Golden Road (2002), was named by Billboard as the biggest country hit of the 2000s decade. The album's fourth single, \"You'll Think of Me\" featuring his nephew and fellow country artist Rory Gilliatte, earned him his first Grammy Award. 2004's Be Here, his third American album became his highest-selling album, being certified 4\u00d7 Platinum.

From an early age Urban's influences reflected the tastes of his parents, who enjoyed country music.[9] His father owned a convenience store and put an ad for a guitar teacher in his shop window,[10] which led to his taking guitar lessons from Sue McCarthy.[11] He entered local competitions and acted in a local theatre company.[7] Urban has said that his guitar playing was influenced by two rock guitarists, Mark Knopfler (Dire Straits) and Lindsey Buckingham (Fleetwood Mac).\n\nIn 1980, Urban was a contestant on the Australian TV talent show New Faces.[12] A few years later, he began making inroads into the Australian country music scene, with regular appearances on the Reg Lindsay Country Homestead TV programme, Mike McClellan's music programme, and various other TV programmes performing duets with Jenny Wilson, a girl from Brisbane. They won a Golden Guitar award at the Tamworth Country Music Festival. Urban also performed regularly on stage at the Northern Suburbs Country Music Club in Bald Hills, where he was a member. He was in a band called Kids Country, which performed during school holidays at various venues and made appearances on the Reg Lindsey show and Conway Country.\n\nMusical career [ edit ]\n\n1989\u20131998: early years [ edit ]\n\nIn November 1989, Urban self-released a promotional extended play seeking a record deal, featuring \"Honky Tonk Rock\" and \"There's a Light On\" on the A-side and \"Angry Words\" and \"Future Plans\" on the B-side, dubbed Looking for a deal !!.[13]\n\nIn 1990, Urban signed with EMI in Australia and released his self-titled debut album.[7] He appeared on the 1990 compilation album Breaking Ground \u2013 New Directions in Country Music, which was nominated for the 1991 ARIA Award for Best Country Album.[14] He toured as a backup act to Slim Dusty between 1993 and 1994. In the mid-1990s, both people recorded a re-worked duet of Dusty's classic \"Lights on the Hill\". Urban appeared for the first time at the Grand Ole Opry backing Dusty.[15] He also sang backing vocals on INXS's 1991 single \"Shining Star\".[16]\n\nUrban moved to Nashville in 1992. The next year, he appeared in the music video for Alan Jackson's rendition of \"Mercury Blues\".[17] He and Vernon Rust co-wrote \"Jesus Gets Jealous of Santa Claus\" on Toby Keith's 1995 album Christmas to Christmas,[18] 4 Runner's 1996 single \"That Was Him (This Is Now)\",[19] he played guitar on Garth Brooks' album Double Live (Garth Brooks album) and \"Tangled Up in Love\" on the Raybon Brothers' 1997 self-titled album.[20] In 1995, he formed a band known as The Ranch, which included drummer Peter Clarke and bassist Jerry Flowers. The Ranch released a self-titled album for Capitol Records Nashville in 1997 and charted two singles on the Hot Country Songs charts that year: \"Walkin' the Country\" and \"Just Some Love\".[21] Throughout the late 1990s, Urban also played guitar on several other artists' albums, such as Paul Jefferson,[22] Tim Wilson, and Charlie Daniels.\n\n1999\u20132006: Keith Urban, Golden Road and Be Here [ edit ]\n\nUrban released his self-titled American debut album in 1999 under the production of session pianist Matt Rollings. It was led by the number 18 single \"It's a Love Thing\", followed by the number four single \"Your Everything\", which made him the first male New Zealand performer to reach the Top 10 on the US country charts.[23] Its follow-up, \"But for the Grace of God\", written by Charlotte Caffey and Jane Wiedlin of The Go-Gos, became his first number 1 hit on the charts. The last single, \"Where the Blacktop Ends\", written by Steve Wariner and Allen Shamblin, went to number three. He won the Top New Male Vocalist Award at the 2001 Academy of Country Music Awards and the 2001 Country Music Association's Horizon Award. Allmusic's Thom Jurek described the first and third singles favorably, and praised the instrumental track \"Rollercoaster\", saying that Urban was \"flat picking his Stratocaster like it was another extremity he was born with.\" He thought that those songs \"balance the slick and sometimes too-soft production on the record\".[24]\n\nUrban in 2005\n\nUrban released a second American album, Golden Road, in 2002. Of the 13 songs included on this album, Urban produced seven himself and co-produced the other six with Dann Huff.[25] The album's lead-off single, \"Somebody Like You\", was released in July 2002 and spent six weeks at number one. The second single was the number three hit \"Raining on Sunday\" which Radney Foster had previously released as a single from his 1998 album See What You Want to See.[26] The third and fourth singles from the album, \"Who Wouldn't Wanna Be Me\" and \"You'll Think of Me\", went to number one, with the latter winning him the Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 2005.[27] In 2002, Urban posed nude for Playgirl.

On 22 September 2005, Urban's third studio album, Golden Road, was certified triple platinum, for sales of three million copies.[31] \"You Look Good in My Shirt\" was originally intended to be the fifth single from this album.[32] Instead, Capitol chose to release \"Days Go By\", the lead-off to his third American album Be Here. By late 2004, this song became Urban's fifth number one hit on the country chart. Although it was not officially released, \"You Look Good in My Shirt\" spent one week at number 60 on the country charts in July 2004[33] and remained a fan favourite.[32] The next single from this album was the number 2 \"You're My Better Half\", followed by the five-week number 1 \"Making Memories of Us\", which was written by Rodney Crowell and previously recorded by both Tracy Byrd[34] and Crowell's side project The Notorious Cherry Bombs.[35] The next singles from this album were \"Better Life\" and \"Tonight I Wanna Cry\".

That same month, Urban recorded a new version of \"You Look Good in My Shirt\" and released it as a single in June of that year. \"Over the years it (\"You Look Good In My Shirt\") has always played like a hit song,\" Urban said. \"That, combined with numerous requests from both fans and radio about why it was never a single, inspired us to get back into the studio and re-record the song.\" The single was a precursor to the \"Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy World Tour\" concert DVD release in the fall of 2008. Later that year, Urban served as a duet artist for Brad Paisley's single \"Start a Band,\" on which both he and Paisley sang and played guitar.
