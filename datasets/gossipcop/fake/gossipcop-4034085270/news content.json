It was weird. It was super fast.\u201d\n\nStamos then joked, \u201cA little baby came out and he looked just like [late comedian and close friend] Don Rickles.\u201d\n\nBorn at 8:32 p.m., William Christopher Stamos arrived on Tuesday, April 10 in Los Angeles, PEOPLE confirmed via his birth certificate.\n\nRichard Shotwell/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nThe actor also praised 31-year-old McHugh, whom he wed Feb. 3 after two and a half years together.\n\n\u201cYou know, people are probably sick of me saying I\u2019ve always wanted a kid, but it just happened. I guess I was waiting for the perfect wife, which I have,\u201d he explained. \u201cCaitlin, she\u2019s been so graceful through this whole thing.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

Different poop colors. There\u2019s green, there\u2019s yellow, I saw some blue this morning which I thought was weird.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also excited about naming his son after his father, whom Stamos called his \u201chero.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope I live up to what my dad did. You know how you get to a point where you go, \u2018My dad\u2019s just a man\u2019? I never got to that point. He was always bigger than life to me so I\u2019m happy to honor him with our little Billy,\u201d the actor explained. \u201cI\u2019m starting to cry right now, Ryan, I\u2019m so emotional.\u201d\n\nStamos and McHugh got engaged at Disneyland in October, just two months before they announced their pregnancy news exclusively to PEOPLE. They then tied the knot and headed to Disney World for their honeymoon in February.\n\n\u201cWe just kind of crammed everything in because it\u2019s been so great,\u201d Stamos said before turning the attention to Seacrest. \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful having a baby. You have to do it, Ryan.\u201d\n\nStamos told PEOPLE that he felt prepared for parenthood.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be a fun dad. I\u2019ve been practicing for a long time,\u201d he told PEOPLE, joking, \u201cI\u2019ve done every schtick you can do with a baby on TV \u2026 all the bits and jokes and diaper gags. I\u2019ll probably just do all that stuff.\u201d\n\nJokes aside, McHugh had no doubt her husband will be confident in his new role. As she told PEOPLE, \u201cThe look on John\u2019s face when I told him we were pregnant was priceless. It was the look of a man who has wanted a family of his own but wasn\u2019t sure it was going to happen for him. Now it is!\u201d", "images":
