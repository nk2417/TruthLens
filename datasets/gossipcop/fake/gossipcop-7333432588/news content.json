She didn\u2019t fight for her marriage last time \u2013 but that\u2019s not going to happen this time around.\u2019\n\nAccording to recent reports, after meeting one another at an event, Brad and Neri \u2018got romantically involved almost straight away\u2019 and were \u2018very much a couple\u2019.\n\nJen also very much \u2018hates the fact that Neri reminds her so much of Angelina Jolie.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrad has denied the claims and told Jen that they\u2019re just good friends, but Jen is less naive now and is determined not to let another woman come between them.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s older and stronger now, she\u2019s not going to let Neri stop her from finally having her happily ever after with Brad. She\u2019s determined that nothing will get in the way of her happiness,\u2019 the source added.\n\nBefore, sources told New Idea that Jen was \u2018keeping her distance\u2019 from Brad, but now the Friends star is making it clear to Neri she has to back off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Last weekend she went and saw Neri, and had a face-to-face with her. It was very calm and there was no big fight, but Jen was firm with Neri and told her to stay away from Brad and not come between them,\u2019 the insider continued.\n\n\u2018Neri was taken aback and denied that she was trying to steal Brad, but Jen just remained strong and stood her ground. She doesn\u2019t care what Neri\u2019s intentions are \u2013 she just wants Brad and her to be together, without any distractions.\u2019\n\nStrangely enough, Jen was seen wearing an arm brace last week while attending Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s engagement party in LA. She kept her reasons quiet on why she was wearing it, leaving onlookers confused.\n\nBrad hit it off with Neri, as they share the same passion for architecture, design and art, but Jen is not going to let history repeat itself this time and wants nothing to stand in the way of her wedding day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJen, who announced her split from her husband Justin Theroux in February, has reportedly been to Brad\u2019s hometown in Missouri to meet Brad\u2019s childhood pastor, Reverend Swadley, recently.\n\nA friend of the pastor told New Idea that the reverend spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible.\n\n\u2018Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them back into the church,\u2019 the friend claimed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He said Jen kept on saying how grateful she was that they had been brought back together,\u2019 the insider added.\n\nThe question is, will Neri put a spanner in the works?\n\nYoung, smart and beautiful, Jen is \u2018jealous\u2019 of Neri and friends say she doesn\u2019t want to lose Brad for a second time.\n\n\u2018Jen desperately wants her renewed relationship with Brad to work, but at the same time, she can\u2019t be dumped by Brad twice,\u2019 a source told New Idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She barely recovered the first time and she fears it will destroy her for good if Brad leaves her for another woman.\u2019\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea \u2013 out now!", "images": ["https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/chrissie-swan-the-shortcut-queen-691e509abfe28.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-18t103613.659-691bb21f4c9ec.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/71038/michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-hollywood.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/Logo-1.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/131095/untitled-design-2023-11-08t103411331.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wordpress-featured-image-template-35-691e75ed0477e.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/26152/ni-brad-jen.jpg?resize=1024%2C683", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/icon-phosphor-circle.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-19t145321.000-691d3f406e345.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/26154/neri.jpg?resize=1024%2C768", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/07/NIFLOGO_Organge.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/gettyimages-2156373625-691bc2c3a0fcf-scaled.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/121578/untitled-design-4.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/ni2546pm1_marketing-cover_v0.1-691a9098143bf-scaled.jpg?resize=1955%2C2560", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?d=mm&s=128", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-19t134714.374-691d2fbe0f750.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/08/wp-header-2025-11-14t145312.168-6916a7b31c394.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/07/wordpress-featured-image-template-11-6863926196e99.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-19t162531.737-691d54db7671a.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-18t112445.554-691bbcd84c0f3.png?resize=380%2C285"], "top_img": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Faye James", "Faye James Is A Regular Contributor At New Idea", "Who", "Practical Parenting", "Works Across Health", "Beauty", "Celebrity", "Royal Content.
