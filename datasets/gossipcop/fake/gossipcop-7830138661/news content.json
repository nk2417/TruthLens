It's the person I love. If you have and experienced love and if you don't understand it or have the tools to move forward, then you're going to have complications,\" said Jay-Z.\n\nJay-Z, who shares three children -- two girls and a boy -- with his Beyonce, said fighting for his marriage meant breaking the cycle of the past.\n\n\"You can either address it or pretend until it blows up at some point. For us, we chose to fight for our love, for our family to give our kids a different outcome to break that cycle for black men and women,\" he added.\n\nJay-Z's extramarital affairs came into light after Beyonce's autobiographical album 'Lemonade' dropped in 2016, and contained many of her intimate thoughts and feelings towards her cheating husband.\n\nJones also asked Jay-Z about US President Donald Trump's recent comments about the African countries, to which Jay-Z said the remarks were \"hurtful\".\n\n\"Everyone feels anger but after the anger it's really hurtful because he's looking down on a whole population of people and he's so misinformed because these places have beautiful people,\" he said.\n\n\n\nas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Addas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n\n\"But on the other side, this has been going on. This is how people on, this has been going on behind closed doors,\" he added.
