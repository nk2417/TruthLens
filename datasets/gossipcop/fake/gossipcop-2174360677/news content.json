{"url": "www.goldderby.com/article/2018/2018-daytime-emmy-nominations-full-list-of-nominees-news/", "text": "The 45th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards nominations honoring the best in daytime television were announced on Wednesday, March 21, live on the CBS talk show \"The Talk.\" Winners will be revealed during the Creative Arts Daytime Emmys on April 27, followed by the main ceremony on Sunday, April 29. So who made the cut for these awards? Scroll down for the complete list.\n\nThe Daytime Emmy Awards cover a wide variety of programming including soap operas, talk shows, game shows, children's shows, animation and more. In recent years the awards have also expanded into the online streaming realm, just like their primetime counterparts, so digital drama series and programs from Netflix and Amazon are also represented.\n\nThe awards for dramatic acting are unique as they undergo an extra pre-nominations phase of voting. TV academy members watched short sample clips of all entrants for lead and supporting awards. The top 10 vote-getters in each category became the pre-nominees, who then submitted performance reels up to 20 minutes in length for review by blue ribbon panels who decided the final nominees and winners in one round. The contenders in younger acting categories skipped the initial round: all eligible candidates in those two races became automatic pre-nominees and went straight to the blue ribbon round.\n\nIn the marquee race for Best Drama Series, \"General Hospital\" is the reigning champion and also the all-time record-holder with 13 victories. Will it defend its title against \"The Bold and the Beautiful,\" \"Days of Our Lives\" and \"The Young and the Restless\"? And will there also be record-extending victories for \"Jeopardy\" (16-time winner for Best Game Show) and \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" (combined 10-time winner for Best Talk Show and Best Entertainment Talk Show). Check out the complete list of nominations below.\n\nRefresh this page for the most up-to-date nominations\n\nDRAMA\n\nBEST DRAMA SERIES\n\n\"The Bold and the Beautiful\"\n\n\"Days of Our Lives\"\n\n\"General Hospital\"\n\n\"The Young and the Restless\"\n\nBEST ACTOR\n\nPeter Bergman, \"The Young and the Restless\"\n\nMichael Easton, \"General Hospital\"\n\nJohn McCook \"The Bold and the Beautiful\"\n\nBilly Miller, \"General Hospital\"\n\nJames Reynolds, \"Days of Our Lives\"\n\nBEST ACTRESS\n\nEileen Davidson, \"The Young and the Restless\"\n\nNancy Lee Grahn, \"General Hospital\"\n\nMarci Miller, \"Days of Our Lives\"\n\nMaura West, \"General Hospital\"\n\nLaura Wright, \"General Hospital\"\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR\n\nWally Kurth, \"General Hospital\"\n\nChandler Massey, \"Days of Our Lives\"\n\nAnthony Montgomery, \"General Hospital\"\n\nGreg Rikaart, \"The Young and the Restless\"\n\nGreg Vaughan, \"Days of Our Lives\"\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS\n\nMarla Adams, \"The Young and the Restless\"\n\nCamryn Grimes, \"The Young and the Restless\"\n\nSusan Seaforth Hayes, \"Days of Our Lives\"\n\nElizabeth Hendrickson, \"The Young and the Restless\"\n\nMishal Morgan, \"The Young and the Restless\"\n\nJacqueline MacInnes Wood, \"The Bold and the Beautiful\"\n\nBEST YOUNGER ACTOR\n\nLucas Adams, \"Days of Our Lives\"\n\nRome Flynn, \"The Bold and the Beautiful\"\n\nTristan Lake Leabu, \"The Young and the Restless\"\n\nCasey Moss, \"Days of Our Lives\"\n\nHudson West, \"General Hospital\"\n\nBEST YOUNGER ACTRESS\n\nReign Edwards, \"The Bold and the Beautiful\"\n\nHayley Erin, \"General Hospital\"\n\nCait Fairbanks, \"The Young and the Restless\"\n\nOlivia Rose Keegan, \"Days of Our Lives\"\n\nChloe Lanier, \"General Hospital\"\n\nBEST GUEST PERFORMER\n\nRyan Ashton, \"The Young and the Restless\"\n\nRobb Derringer, \"Days of Our Lives\"\n\nJohn Enos, \"Days of Our Lives\"\n\nMorgan Fairchild, \"Days of Our Lives\"\n\nVernee Watson, \"General Hospital\"\n\nBEST WRITING TEAM\n\n\"The Bold and the Beautiful\"\n\n\"Days of Our Lives\"\n\n\"General Hospital\"\n\n\"The Young and the Restless\"\n\n\n\nBEST DIRECTING TEAM\n\n\"The Bold and the Beautiful\"\n\n\"Days of Our Lives\"\n\n\"General Hospital\"\n\n\"The Young and the Restless\"\n\nBEST DIGITAL DRAMA SERIES\n\n\"The Bay The Series\"\n\n\"Eastsiders\"\n\n\"Ladies of the Lake\"\n\n\"Tainted Dreams\"\n\n\"Venice The Series\"\n\n\"Zac and Mia\"\n\nBEST ACTOR IN A DIGITAL DRAMA\n\nKristos Andrews, \"The Bay The Series\"\n\nJames Bland, \"Giants\"\n\nRichard Brooks, \"The Rich and the Ruthless\"\n\nVan Hanasis, \"Eastsiders\"\n\nKian Lawley, \"Zac and Mia\"\n\nBEST ACTRESS IN A DIGITAL DRAMA\n\nMary Beth Evans, \"The Bay The Series\"\n\nVanessa Kelly, \"Giants\"\n\nLilly Melgar, \"The Bay The Series\"\n\nAlicia Minshew, \"Tainted Dreams\"\n\nAnne Winters, \"Zac and Mia\"\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR IN A DIGITAL DRAMA SERIES\n\nBrandon Beemer, \"The Bay The Series\"\n\nStephen Guarino, \"Eastsiders\"\n\nJohn Halbach, \"Eastsiders\"\n\nEric Nelsen, \"The Bay The Series\"\n\nDerrell Whitt, \"The Bay The Series\"\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS IN A DIGITAL DRAMA\n\nMolly Burnett, \"Relationship Status\"\n\nJade Harlow, \"The Bay The Series\"\n\nTerri Ivens, \"The Bay The Series\"\n\nKira Reed Lorsch, \"The Bay The Series\"\n\nAlexis G.
