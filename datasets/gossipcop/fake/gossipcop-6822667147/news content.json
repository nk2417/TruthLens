{"url": "www.thedailybeast.com/oprah-feuds", "text": "David Letterman is known for his feuds, but none has lasted as long as his nearly two-decade tangle with Oprah. By most accounts, it started when Letterman hosted the Oscars in 1995, and used her name for his failed \"Uma, Oprah; Oprah, Uma\" joke. In 2005, Letterman finally settled the skirmish when Oprah went on his show as a guest and told him, \"I want you to know, it's really over, whatever you thought was happening.\" But is it? Last September, Letterman told Jon Stewart that the feud actually began when he was having lunch in the same restaurant as Oprah and Steadman while on vacation. As a gag, the late-night host told the waiter that Winfrey\u2019s table was picking up his check; but apparently, Oprah didn't think the joke was funny. \"I spent the last 12 to 15 years kissing up to Oprah,\u201d Letterman admitted on Late Show this month after he wasn't invited to Winfrey's finale extravaganza in Chicago. \u201cHonest to God. Every day, I get out of bed and I think, What can I do to suck up to Oprah?\" In regard to his lack of invite, Letterman said he was \"crushed. Disappointed and crushed. I want to bask in the glory that is Oprah, who doesn\u2019t?\"", "images":
