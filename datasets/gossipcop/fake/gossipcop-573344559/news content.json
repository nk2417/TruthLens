{"url": "stylecaster.com/beyonce-pregnant-fourth-child-video/", "text": "It\u2019s only been a year since Beyonc\u00e9 broke the internet when she gave birth to not one but two babies with her husband, Jay-Z. But is she already ready for another one? The BeyHive sure think so after the 36-year-old singer was photographed with what fans claim to be a very obvious baby bump.\n\nTo prove their theory, many fans are referencing a video from a recent concert on Beyonc\u00e9\u2018s On the Run Tour II with Jay-Z. The video shows Beyonc\u00e9 in a sparkly white outfit with what fans are confident is a small baby bump sticking out of her midsection.\n\nIn addition to Star magazine (a not-so-reliable tabloid, if we\u2019re being honest) reporting that the singer is \u201cover the moon\u201d with her pregnancy, fans are also referencing a tour outfit that they believe is a secret message from Beyonc\u00e9 herself, proving that she\u2019s pregnant. The outfit, a skin-tight gold dress that Beyonc\u00e9 pairs with a giant cape, features a heart on her midsection, which many fans believe represents her baby\u2019s heartbeat.Given Bey and Jay-Z\u2019s love for the number four (4:44 is the title of Jay-Z\u2019s last album and their wedding anniversary is on April 4), it makes sense that the couple is expecting their fourth child, as fans have noted. Needless to say, the BeyHive is alive with speculation (and worry that Bey might cancel the rest of her tour to go on maternity leave.)\n\nAs excited as we would be for another Beyonc\u00e9 pregnancy, it\u2019s important to note that neither she nor Jay-Z have confirmed anything. And until they do, all rumors are speculation. Likewise, as Lili Reinhart, Drew Barrymore, Blac Chyna, and dozens of other celebrities who have fought off pregnancy rumors have proven, bloating is a real thing and assuming that someone is pregnant based on how much their stomach resembles a \u201cbaby bump\u201d is dangerous and a form of body-shaming.\n\nWe get it. A Beyonc\u00e9 pregnancy would make 2018. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.", "images": ["https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/labubus-on-display-1.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/who-performed-with-beyonce.jpg?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce1.jpg?w=650", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/alo-yoga-black-friday-sale-2025.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://trc.taboola.com/1394147/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1-Square.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/RemiBader_Homepage.webp?w=244", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/william-harry.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Long-Puffer-Coats.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ohio-state-penn-state-college-football-november-2025.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Usher-Cox.png?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/beyonce-grammys.jpg?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Sarah-Ferguson.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cynthia-erivo-.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/P1036HZS.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247556248-2.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce1.jpg?w=3000&h=1687&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/no-doubt-tickets.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ariana-grande-weight-loss.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ariana-grande-1-1.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MVW.png?resize=232,175", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/wicked-for-good-elphaba.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/wicked-for-good-ariana-grande.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/wicked-for-good.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/streaming-service-free-trials-2025.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce1.jpg?w=650", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Pham"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/737515/beyonce-pregnant-fourth-child-video/", "title": "This Video Is Making Fans Think Beyonc\u00e9 Is Pregnant with Her Fourth Child", "meta_data": {"description": "Beyonce is pregnant with her fourth child, according to fans who predict that the \"Formation\" singer is expecting due to a concert video that shows her with an apparent baby bump.
