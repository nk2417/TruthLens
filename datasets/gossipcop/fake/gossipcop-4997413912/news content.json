The recipient of several accolades, including a Golden Globe Award and two Screen Actors Guild Awards, in addition to nominations for an Academy Award and four British Academy Film Awards, Forbes ranked her as one of the highest-paid actresses in the world in 2020.\n\nBlunt made her acting debut in a 2001 stage production of The Royal Family and portrayed Catherine Howard in the television miniseries Henry VIII (2003). She made her feature film debut in the drama My Summer of Love (2004). Blunt's breakthrough came in 2006 with her starring roles in the television film Gideon's Daughter and the comedy film The Devil Wears Prada. The former won her a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress. Her profile continued to grow with leading roles in The Young Victoria (2009), Salmon Fishing in the Yemen (2011), The Adjustment Bureau (2011), Looper (2012), Edge of Tomorrow (2014), and Into the Woods (2014).\n\nBlunt received critical acclaim for playing an idealistic FBI agent in the crime film Sicario (2015), an alcoholic in the thriller The Girl on the Train (2016), and a survivalist mother in her husband John Krasinski's horror film A Quiet Place (2018), for which she won a SAG Award for Best Supporting Actress. She has since starred in the sequels Mary Poppins Returns (2018) and A Quiet Place Part II (2021), and the miniseries The English (2022). Her portrayal of Katherine Oppenheimer in Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer (2023) earned her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nBlunt has been working with the American Institute for Stuttering since 2006 to help children overcome stuttering through educational resources and raise awareness of the realities of the condition. She is on the board of directors of the institute, and hosts a gala for it to raise funds for speech therapy scholarships for children and adults.\n\nEarly life\n\nEmily Olivia Laura Blunt was born in London on 23 February 1983.[1][2] She is the second of four children, born to a former actress and English teacher,[3] Joanna Mackie,[4] and a barrister, Oliver Blunt KC.[5][6] Her mother gave up acting to parent full time before Blunt started school.[5][3] Blunt described herself as a \"shy and awkward\" child,[7] who began having difficulties with stuttering, a condition she described as debilitating and \"like an imposter living in your body.\"[8][9] She experienced it at its worst between the ages of seven and 14.[10] Intimidated by speaking, she spent much time watching people, as well as creating elaborate games for herself[3][5] and playing the cello.[11][12] She credits a school teacher with encouraging her to perform in class plays, where using voices different from her own allowed her to disconnect from herself and speak fluently. It also gave her the confidence to continue on the stage and discover her love of acting.[13][10] She has said that her stutter largely receded in adulthood, but still occasionally emerges under stress.[14][8][9] She attended Hurtwood House, a sixth-form boarding school in Surrey, known for its performing arts programme.[15] After appearing in a school play at the Edinburgh Festival, Blunt was discovered and signed by an agent.[15][16] Once she finished her school exams, she began auditioning.[16]\n\nCareer\n\n2001\u20132004: Early work\n\nIn November 2001, Blunt made her professional acting debut at age 18 in Peter Hall's West End production of the play The Royal Family, in which she played the granddaughter of Judi Dench's character.[17] Critic Tom Keatinge hailed the production, writing that \"Peter Hall's direction and Anthony Ward's tremendous set combine with all this to make The Royal Family a terrific night's entertainment\", and that \"it provides a vehicle for acting of the finest quality, with strong performances from the whole ensemble\".[18] For her performance, Blunt was named \"Best Newcomer\" by the Evening Standard.[19] The following year, she portrayed Eugenie in Nicholas Wright's play Vincent in Brixton at the National Theatre, and Juliet in Indhu Rubasingham's production of Romeo and Juliet at Chichester Festival Theatre.[1][20] In 2003, Blunt made her screen debut in the British television drama Boudica, about the life of the ancient Celtic warrior-queen who fought the Romans. That same year, she was praised for her performance as the 16th-century Queen Catherine Howard in the two-part British television drama Henry VIII.[20]\n\nIn 2004, Blunt made her theatrical film debut in Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski's critically acclaimed independent British drama My Summer of Love, about an infatuation between two young women from different socioeconomic backgrounds in the English countryside.[20][5] The film involved much improvisation, which Blunt found an interesting challenge, later stating that Pawlikowski's approach was \"free spirited, collaborative and alive.\"[21][16] Co-starring as Tamsin, she received considerable attention for her performance,[20] garnering critical praise,[22] with David Ansen of Newsweek writing: \"Press and Blunt are major discoveries ... they conjure up the role-playing raptures of youth with perfect poetic pitch\".[23] Blunt won the Evening Standard British Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer and was nominated for the British Independent Film Award for Most Promising Newcomer.[24] She credited her experience making the film as having an impact on her career choices, stating that it was \"such a foray into the great unknown ....[like] putting your feet to the fire\" and she \"loved that feeling of terror and excitement\" and \"looked for it ever since.\"[16][25]\n\n2005\u20132010: The Devil Wears Prada and breakthrough\n\nBlunt's international breakthrough came in 2006.[19] She co-starred as the troubled only child of a New Labour spin doctor in the British television drama film Gideon's Daughter,[20] and played Emily Charlton, the senior assistant of fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly (played by Meryl Streep), in the comedy-drama film The Devil Wears Prada. The Devil Wears Prada was a commercial success, grossing $326 million.[26] Blunt's performance was deemed a standout,[1][19][27] with Clifford Pugh of the Houston Chronicle asserting that \"[Blunt] has many of the film's best lines and steals nearly every scene she's in.\"[28] Blunt won the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Series, Miniseries or Television Film for her performance in Gideon's Daughter, and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture for her performance in The Devil Wears Prada.[29] She also received a BAFTA Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for the latter.[30] At the 79th Academy Awards, she and co-star Anne Hathaway co-presented the Academy Award for Best Costume Design, with both acting as their characters from the film.[31] Blunt also appeared in the independent mystery drama Irresistible (2006). After The Devil Wears Prada, Streep described Blunt as \"the best young actress I've worked with in some time, perhaps ever\".[7]\n\nBlunt's profile continued to rise, and in 2007, she appeared in four films: the horror film Wind Chill, the romantic drama The Jane Austen Book Club, the comedy-drama Dan in Real Life, and the biographical comedy-drama Charlie Wilson's War.[20] In 2008, Blunt appeared in Sunshine Cleaning in the role of Norah Lorkowski, an underachiever who starts a crime-scene clean-up business with her sister Rose (Amy Adams). The film premiered at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival, where it received positive reviews, particularly for Adams' and Blunt's performances. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine commented \"This funny and touching movie depends on two can-do actresses to scrub past the biohazard of noxious clich\u00e9s that threaten to intrude. Adams and Blunt get the job done.\"[32] A. O. Scott of The New York Times agreed, stating \"Amy Adams and Emily Blunt [...] attack their roles with vivacity and dedication...\"[33] She then starred in The Great Buck Howard as Valerie Brennan, which premiered at the same festival.[20]\n\nIn 2009, Blunt portrayed Queen Victoria in the independent period drama The Young Victoria, directed by Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e and written by Julian Fellowes, which focused primarily on her early life and reign, as well as her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.[34] Blunt admitted to having little prior knowledge of the Queen, but after consulting her mother, found her to be \"remarkable\" and \"a very 21st century sort of woman.\"[35] Blunt's performance earned critical accolades, and she was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama[36] and Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress,[37] among others. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly concluded that \"Director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e's images have a creamy stateliness, but this is no gilded princess fantasy \u2013 it's the story of a budding ruler who learns to control her surroundings, and Blunt makes that journey at once authentic and relevant.\"[38] That same year, Blunt received the BAFTA Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year.[39]\n\nShe starred in the Toby Spanton\u2013directed short film Curiosity.[40] She also voiced Matilda Mouseling, the mother of the titular character, in the television series Angelina Ballerina: The Next Steps. In 2010, Blunt played a supporting role in the period horror film The Wolfman, starring Benicio del Toro and Anthony Hopkins. A re-adaptation of the 1941 film of the same name, the film received mainly negative reviews, and according to the Los Angeles Times, was one of the largest box-office failures of all time.[41][42] Blunt was offered the role of Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow for Iron Man 2 (2010), but she was contractually obligated by 20th Century Fox to join the Jack Black-led comedy film Gulliver's Travels after the studio exercised an option it had for her when she signed on for The Devil Wears Prada.[43][44]\n\n2011\u20132014: Science-fiction and comedy films\n\nIn 2011, Blunt co-starred with Matt Damon in the thriller The Adjustment Bureau, playing a dancer who is \"being mysteriously kept apart\" from a politician. The film earned generally positive reviews, with critics praising Blunt and Damon's chemistry.[45] Blunt starred in the British romantic comedy-drama Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, directed by Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m. She played a financial adviser who recruits a fisheries expert to help realise a sheikh's vision of bringing the sport of fly fishing to the Yemen desert, resulting in a spiritual journey for both in the process.[46] The film premiered at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival,[47] receiving positive reviews, as did Blunt's performance. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times noted \"Blunt and [co-star Ewan McGregor] are two of the most gifted and attractive actors working today, able to play off each other with great style...\"[48] Blunt was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance. Also that year, she made a cameo appearance in Disney's The Muppets, as Miss Piggy's receptionist, and starred in the independent comedy-drama Your Sister's Sister.[49] In November 2011, Blunt was named the ambassador of the new Yves Saint Laurent fragrance Opium.[50]\n\nIn 2012, Blunt starred in the romantic comedy The Five-Year Engagement, directed by Nicholas Stoller and co-starring Jason Segel, in which she and Segel played a couple whose relationship becomes strained when their engagement is continually extended. The film earned positive reviews, with Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News remarking that \"Blunt has never been more relaxed, and she and Segel have a believably warm chemistry.\"[51] She then starred in Looper, a science fiction action film directed by Rian Johnson. Blunt played Sara, a tough farm woman and single mother, who aids and falls in love with a time-traveller. The film premiered at the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, where it served as the opening film, and earned highly positive feedback. Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter credited Blunt for \"effectively [revealing] Sara's tough and vulnerable sides.\"[52] Also that year, she starred in the comedy-drama Arthur Newman as the troubled Charlotte, who is trying to run away from her past.[53] The film received generally mixed-to-negative reviews.[54][55]\n\nIn 2014, Blunt starred in Edge of Tomorrow, a film adaptation of the Japanese novel All You Need Is Kill, written by Hiroshi Sakurazaka.[56] Blunt played Sergeant Rita Vrataski, a Special Forces warrior tasked with training a public relations officer to defeat invading extraterrestrials. Blunt trained three months for her role, \"focusing on everything from weights to sprints to yoga, aerial wire work and gymnastics\", and studying Krav Maga.[57] The film was commercially successful, grossing $370,541,256[58] and earned positive reviews. Many critics took note of the atypically dominating role portrayed by Blunt, and Justin Chang of Variety noted that \"Blunt is alert, energized and emotionally present in a none-too-taxing role.\"[59] For her performance, Blunt won the Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie.[60]\n\nBlunt then played the role of the Baker's Wife in The Walt Disney Company's film adaptation of Stephen Sondheim's musical Into the Woods, directed by Rob Marshall and featuring an ensemble cast.[61][62] Ironically, Blunt was pregnant throughout filming, while playing a character who is barren throughout the film's first act.[63][64] The film was a commercial success and earned generally positive reviews, with Blunt earning praise for her acting and singing. Richard Corliss of Time remarked that \"When Blunt is onscreen, these woods are alive with the magic of a fractured fairy tale...\"[65] She was nominated for her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Comedy or Musical for her performance.[66]\n\n2015\u2013present: established actress\n\nIn 2015, Blunt starred in the crime thriller Sicario, directed by Denis Villeneuve. Blunt played Kate Macer, a principled FBI agent assigned to take down the leader of a powerful Mexican drug cartel. The film was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival, where it received critical acclaim. Blunt received considerable praise for her performance, with Dan Jolin of Empire magazine calling it \"nuanced\", and stating that \"her straight-arrow-sharp determination becomes painfully dulled\",[67] and while Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian found her character implausible, he praised Blunt for \"[brazening] out any possible absurdity with great acting focus and front\".[68] Blunt was nominated for her second consecutive Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie.[69]\n\nIn 2016, Blunt co-starred in The Huntsman: Winter's War, which serves as both a prequel and sequel to Snow White and the Huntsman (2012). The film, directed by Cedric Nicolas-Troyan, was mostly dismissed by critics.[70][71] Blunt then headlined the mystery thriller The Girl on the Train, directed by Tate Taylor. Based on Paula Hawkins's best-selling novel of the same name, Blunt played Rachel Watson, an alcoholic who becomes involved in a missing person investigation. While the film received mixed reviews from critics, who felt it failed to live up to the novel, Blunt's performance earned considerable praise. Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers remarked that \"the movie gives away the game faster than the novel\", but credited Blunt for \"playing the hell out of [her character] and adding a touch of welcome empathy. [She] digs into the role like an actress possessed \u2013 there's not an ounce of vanity here, [and she] raise[s] Girl to the level of spellbinder.\"[72] She was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.[73][74]\n\nAfter providing her voice for the 2017 animated films My Little Pony: The Movie and Animal Crackers, Blunt made her return to live action in her husband John Krasinski's horror film A Quiet Place, which follows a family being tormented by monstrous creatures that hunt by sound.[75] The script was originally written by Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, who began writing it in January 2016 based on a concept they conceived in college,[76] and they wanted Blunt for the role of the mother.[77] When Krasinski re-wrote the script, he wrote it with Blunt in mind for the role, but did not ask her to do it as she had just had a child, was working on another film, and he was concerned that if he asked she would either decline it or accept it to support him. \"I just thought if she does this, she has to come to it on her own.\"[78] Blunt initially did not want to be cast, but after reading Krasinski's draft on a plane flight she felt she needed to do it as the story \"represented some of my deepest fears \u2013 of not being able to protect my children.\"[17][78] Blunt contributed to the pre-production stage of the film.[79][78] A Quiet Place served as the opening night film at the 2018 South by Southwest film festival, where it received critical acclaim;[80][81] Eric Kohn of IndieWire lauded the cast for \"contribut[ing] credible intensity to their scenes with a degree of sophistication rare for this type of material\", while Laura Prudom of IGN remarked that, \"Blunt, in particular, is put through the wringer in ways that would seem almost farcical, if she didn't play them with such compelling conviction.\"[82][83]\n\nBlunt promoting A Quiet Place in 2018\n\nThe same year, Blunt played the title character in Rob Marshall's musical fantasy film Mary Poppins Returns. It served as a sequel to the 1964 film, with Blunt taking over the role from Julie Andrews.[84] Owen Gleiberman of Variety found Blunt to be \"practically perfect in every way\" and added that she \"inhabits Mary Poppins' snappishly entrancing spirit, and in the musical numbers she generates her own spit-spot radiance\".[85] She received two SAG nominations for her performances in A Quiet Place and Mary Poppins Returns, winning Best Supporting Actress for A Quiet Place, and she also received her sixth Golden Globe nomination for Mary Poppins Returns.[86][87] In 2020, Blunt guest-starred in her husband's web series Some Good News, which began streaming on YouTube during the COVID-19 pandemic.[88] She starred in the romantic drama Wild Mountain Thyme \u2013 based on John Patrick Shanley's play Outside Mullingar.[89] The part required her to speak with an Irish accent; neither the film nor her accent were well received.[90][91][92] In the same year, Forbes ranked her as the sixth highest-paid actress in the world, with annual earnings of $22.5 million.[93]\n\nBlunt in 2019\n\nBlunt reprised her role in the horror sequel A Quiet Place Part II (2021), which was released after a year-long delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It became one of the first major Hollywood films to be released theatrically since the beginning of the pandemic.[94] Peter Bradshaw bemoaned that the \"excellent\" Blunt did not have more screen time.[95] As with the first film, it also emerged as a commercial success.[96] Later that year, Blunt starred alongside Dwayne Johnson in the adventure film Jungle Cruise, based on the eponymous amusement ride.[97] It was released simultaneously in theatres and digitally on Disney+ Premier Access.[98] Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times disliked the picture saying \"not even Emily Blunt, doing her best Katharine Hepburn impression, can keep this leaky boat ride afloat\".[99] The following year, Blunt played an avenging mother in the television miniseries The English, a western from Hugo Blick.[100] Critics were impressed with her performance.[101] Lucy Mangan of The Guardian said, \"Blunt is at her best yet, giving us a woman made brave and undauntable by resolve\".[102] She received another SAG Award nomination for it.[103]\n\nIn Christopher Nolan's biographical film Oppenheimer (2023), starring Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, Blunt portrayed the eponymous scientist's wife, Katherine, who was a member of the Communist Party USA.[104] She took a pay cut to work on the film, earning $4 million in lieu of her usual $10- to $20-million salary.[105] Nolan said that he thought about \"running away\" from the character while writing the script as she was \"terrifying\", but Blunt humanised her and surprised him in how she embraced her negative qualities; \"No vanity, no fear of humiliation, no wanting to control the way she would appear\".[106] The film was critically acclaimed, although some criticism was made of the writing of the female characters.[107][108] Blunt's performance received praise,[109][110] and was singled out for elevating the limited material she had.[111][112] Writing for Empire, Dan Jolin said that Blunt \"busts out of the supportive/suffering wife archetype as the alcoholic but sharp-witted Kitty Oppenheimer\" and delivers \"one of the film's most rousing scenes in an intense verbal duel with bullish lawyer Roger Robb\",[113] and Tomris Laffly of The Wrap called her performance \"subtly scene-stealing\".[114] Blunt once again received nominations for the Golden Globe, SAG, and BAFTA Award,[115][116][30] in addition to her first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress.[117] With a worldwide gross of over $950 million, Oppenheimer emerged as Blunt's highest-grossing film.[118] Her next release that year, the Netflix crime drama Pain Hustlers opposite Chris Evans, received poor reviews from critics.[119][120]\n\nBlunt next starred with Ryan Gosling in David Leitch's action comedy film The Fall Guy (2024).[121] For her part as a filmmaker in it, she drew inspiration from Greta Gerwig.[122] IGN's Siddhant Adlakha was appreciate of the romantic chemistry between Blunt and Gosling.[123] It did not perform well commercially.[124] She then had a voice role in Krasinski's live-action animated fantasy film IF.[125]\n\nAs of February 2025, Blunt has filmed the sports drama The Smashing Machine, starring Dwayne Johnson as wrestler Mark Kerr, which is set for release later in the year.[126] She will also star in Steven Spielberg's as-yet untitled science fiction film, co-starring Josh O'Connor.[127] Blunt will reprise the role of Emily Charlton in The Devil Wears Prada 2, which is scheduled for release in May 2026.[128]\n\nReception\n\nJournalists have noted Blunt's versatility as an actor and her roles in various genres, including drama, comedy, musicals, and action.[135] The Guardian observed her ability to not be pigeonholed into a type of role, and wrote that she \"specialises in a sort of calculated understatement\", praising her \"insight into what makes characters tick and her facility for accents\".[5] Commenting on her engaging screen presence, Rachel Rosenblint of Elle stated that \"she has a knack for playing subtle, unspoken notes like a virtuoso\".[27] The New York Times regarded Blunt as having a \"taste for the offbeat and a fetching lack of vanity when it comes to playing disagreeable women\" and noted her \"adventurous spirit\" as a performer.[4] Describing the nuances of a performance, The Age wrote, \"It's no wonder that Meryl Streep has already pronounced Blunt \"the best young actress I've worked with in some time, perhaps ever\".\"[129] Aaron Hicklin said in The Guardian that Blunt's career \"has been marked by a succession of stretching new roles\".[136] The Los Angeles Times assessed that from the start of her career, Blunt \"has always proved up for whatever the challenge may be\", and noted her \"fluidity\" in working between drama and comedy.[137] Screen Rant stated that Blunt has \"a number of iconic roles under her belt\".[138] Her work in action roles has also been singled out, with Collider writing that it is \"proof that action cinema has the potential to be morally, ethically, and emotionally nuanced\", and deeming Blunt one of the \"rare performers\" that exceed as both an actor and movie star.[133] Catherine Shoard of The Guardian named her \"the biggest British female movie star of her generation\", comparing her to Keira Knightley, Carey Mulligan, Rachel Weisz, and Kate Winslet.[139] Vanity Fair commented that she has portrayed \"a kaleidoscope of mesmerizing characters\" and found a \"delicate balance\" as \"a movie star with character-actor range\".[17]\n\nAdvocacy\n\nBlunt helps to promote and raise funds for the Malala Fund, a non-profit organisation that advocates for girls' education, co-founded by Malala Yousafzai.[140] She also works with Family Reach, an organisation that helps financially support families affected by cancer.[141] Blunt has also been working with the American Institute for Stuttering since 2006 to help children overcome stuttering through educational resources and raise awareness of the realities of the condition.[9] She is on the board of directors of the institute, and hosts a gala for it each year to raise funds for speech therapy scholarships for children and adults.[142][7]\n\nPersonal life\n\nBlunt was in a relationship with Canadian singer Michael Bubl\u00e9 from 2005 to 2008.[143] She and American actor John Krasinski were introduced to each other by a mutual friend and began dating in November 2008.[144][145] They became engaged in August 2009 and married in Como, Italy, in July 2010.[145][146] They have two daughters, one born in 2014 and the other in 2016.[147][148]\n\nIn 2012, Blunt became the sister-in-law of actor Stanley Tucci when he married her sister Felicity.[149] In 2015, Blunt became an American citizen through naturalisation, making her a dual citizen of the UK and US.[150]\n\nActing credits and awards\n\nAccording
