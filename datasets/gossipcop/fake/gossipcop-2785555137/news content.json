We take a look, below.\n\nThe gender is top secret\n\nThe royals keep mum about the baby\u2019s sex before the birth.\n\nAll anybody could talk about before the birth of Prince Louis was whether Kate Middleton and Prince William would be having another prince or princess.\n\nIn fact, the world didn\u2019t find out the gender of any of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s children until after the birth.\n\nThis is typically a standard rule for members of the royal family.\n\nEven Kate and Will themselves are reported to have chosen not to find out Prince Louis\u2019 gender until the birth itself.\n\nTravelling abroad is frowned upon\n\nUnlike many other royal women, Meghan is more affected by this \u201crule\u201d \u2013 she\u2019d just touched down in Australia when she announced her pregnancy.\n\nAccording to reports, pregnant royals are encouraged to keep travelling abroad to a minimum \u2013 and it\u2019s all to do with safety measures.\n\nWhile royal women usually conduct engagements up until the end of their pregnancy (they usually don\u2019t have an official \u201cmaternity leave\u201d until after the baby is born) they\u2019re encouraged to stay as close to home as possible so emergency help is more readily available.\n\nKate did travel to Norway while pregnant with Prince Louis \u2013 but she\u2019s said to have kept other trips to a minimum.\n\nIn February 2019, just weeks away from giving birth, Meghan and Harry stopped in Morocco for a short official visit.\n\nRoyal mums-to-be don\u2019t have baby showers\n\nIt was speculated that the Duchess of Sussex would probably have to give a pre-birth party a miss due to royal tradition.\n\nAccording to royal expert Victoria Arbiter, throwing an elaborate baby shower is unheard of for members of The Firm.\n\nWhile the royals are \u201cvery wealthy\u2026 a lavish baby shower would be seen as highly inappropriate\u2026There\u2019s nothing they can\u2019t go out and buy themselves\u201d.\n\nDespite reports that Pippa Middleton threw a party for Kate before Prince George\u2019s birth in 2013 many royal experts believe this wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nHowever, in February 2019, Meghan jetted off to New York for a star-studded baby shower thrown by Amal Clooney and Serena Williams.\n\nThe elaborate \u00a3300,000 baby shower took place at the swanky \u00a360k-a-night penthouse at The Mark Hotel in New York.\n\nIt was attended by an A-list crowd including designers Jessica Mulroney and Misha Nonoo, and US TV anchor Gayle King.\n\nYou won\u2019t believe how many midwives are involved\n\nTraditionally, royal mums-to-be would give birth at home.\n\nThe Queen, for example, had all four of her children in the royal residences \u2013 as did Queen Victoria.\n\nBut this tradition was quashed by Princess Anne and followed by Princess Diana, who gave birth to Princes William and Harry in the private Lindo Wing of St Mary\u2019s Hospital in Paddington, London.\n\nAnd while this has now become a tradition \u2013 with Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis all being born at St Mary\u2019s too, there\u2019s still an army of doctors, midwives and anaesthetists on hand.\n\nIn fact, Kate had three midwives during Princess Charlotte\u2019s birth \u2013 and it\u2019s expected Meghan will be given the same expert treatment.\n\nAlthough sources have revealed to The Sun that Meghan wants to have her baby at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey, she is still expected to have several midwives on hand for the birth of baby Sussex.\n\nOnce the baby is born, the Queen must be the first to find out\n\nWhen Meghan and Harry welcome their son or daughter, the first person to be informed of the new royal birth has to be Her Majesty.\n\nRoyal protocol dictates the Queen must be in the know before anyone else \u2013 including grandparents.\n\nSo while Meghan might be keen to make a trans-Atlantic phone call, Prince Harry will probably have to follow in his brother\u2019s footsteps and inform the Queen via encrypted telephone first.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t know exactly when the Duchess of Sussex is due to give birth, Meghan revealed she was six months\u2019 pregnant as she greeted crowds in Birkenhead.\n\nBuckingham Palace posts a notice of the royal birth\n\nA notice is placed on the forecourt of Buckingham Palace announcing the birth, and the time of delivery.\n\nIt\u2019s tradition that a framed notice of birth goes on display on a ceremonial easel on the forecourt.\n\nNotices have been posted on the occasion of a Royal birth for at least as long as Buckingham Palace has been the Sovereign\u2019s official residence \u2013 from 1837.\n\nHowever, the royals still have to register their baby\u2019s birth.\n\nThe baby is usually given three to four names\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever struggled to think of just one baby name, spare a thought for Meghan and Harry, who\u2019ll probably have to think of four.\n\nRoyals typically have four names. For example, Prince Harry has four: Henry Charles Albert David while Kate and Will\u2019s children have three: Prince George Alexander Louis, Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana and Prince Louis Arthur Charles.\n\nMeanwhile, a recent Expedia report found that Albert was the most popular male Royal name of all time while Victoria is the name of the greatest number of Royal women.\n\nIn more Royal Family news, Meghan Markle has been warned by doctors \u201cnot to put her baby at risk for the sake of fashion\u201d after she stepped out in TWO pairs of five inch heels in one day.\n\nAnd Meghan Markle broke down in tears after her protection officer quit earlier this year.\n\nPlus Meghan Markle said Prince Harry will be a \u201cfantastic dad\u201d and she\u2019s \u201cthrilled\u201d about royal baby ahead of April due date.", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/newspress-collage-kht0gzrnn-1763544630846.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&1763544644&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000325300640.jpg?strip=all&w=741", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT0004619178301-e1547848936197.jpg?strip=all&w=834", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TOB-18_11-kelly-brook-comp_182572.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ac-horoscope-daily-04-thursday.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000396072545.jpg?strip=all&w=635", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000382314138.jpg?strip=all&w=812", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RB-19-11-APP_COMP_2474a9.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/image-c3a02216eb.jpg?quality=90&strip=all", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000421829738.jpg?strip=all&w=640", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT0004619178301-e1547850286545.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000462214979.jpg?strip=all&w=583", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/royal-wedding-145234jpg-js407971109.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT0004619178301-e1547850286545.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1920&h=1080&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/6827084/meghan-markle-pregnancy-royal-rules/", "title": "Meghan Markle will need to follow these royal pregnancy rules as she and Prince Harry prepare for parenthood", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
