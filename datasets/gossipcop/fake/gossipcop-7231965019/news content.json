Russia also seized a warehouse and a resort complex in Moscow used by U.S. diplomatic staff.\n\nThe State Department hasn\u2019t said how many U.S. diplomats will be forced to leave and how many Russian nationals and others who work at the U.S. government will be laid off.\n\nSecretary of State Rex Tillerson has said he will respond by Sept. 1, but has not yet given a public assessment of how the cuts are likely to impact the vast array of embassy-backed services in Russia, from assisting U.S. businesses to enforcing arms control agreements.\n\nU.S. relations with Moscow have nosedived since Putin\u2019s government seized Crimea and backed separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014, promping U.S. sanctions.\n\nThey worsened last year when U.S. intelligence agencies determined that the Kremlin interfered in the U.S. presidential race in a bid to help Donald Trump win.\n\nPresident Obama retaliated in December by expelling 35 Russian diplomats who the White House said were spies, and seizing two Russian-owned waterfront compounds - one in New York and the other in Maryland - that it said were used for espionage.\n\nPutin initially did not respond, but his order to cut the U.S. staff last month followed a near-unanimous vote in the U.S. Congress to impose additional sanctions on Russia for its meddling in the election. President Trump later signed the bill into law.\n\nTrump has repeatedly praised Putin and called for improving relations with Moscow. But any attempts to do so have been hampered by the widening FBI investigation into whether his campaign cooperated with the Russian attempts to influence the U.S. election.\n\nThe U.S. embassy statement Monday cited the Russian order to cut staff as the reason it was suspending visa processing.\n\n\u201cAs a result of the Russian government\u2019s personnel cap imposed on the U.S. Mission, all non-immigrant visa operations across Russia will be suspended beginning August 23, 2017,\u201d the embassy said on its website.\n\nThe move will affect Russians applying for tourist, business and other kinds of nonimmigrant visas to the United States.\n\nThe U.S. Mission in Russia issued 182,958 visas in 2016, according to the State Department. About 25% were issued at U.S. consulates in St. Petersburg, Ekaterinburg and Vladivostok, and the rest in Moscow.\n\nThe embassy said it would begin Monday to cancel appointments for visa interviews. No visas will be processed until Sept. 1, after which all applicants must undergo an interview in Moscow, it said.\n\nEven before the announcement, interview schedules were backed up 45 days or more. After Sept. 1, the embassy warned, visa processing for Russian citizens will be conducted \u201con a greatly reduced scale.\u201d\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow would respond after a closer examination of the U.S. announcement. He cautioned against a response that would similarly reduce applications of American applicants for Russian visas, saying that the Russian response would not be intended to punish American citizens.\n\n\u201cIf someone hoped that in this case a bad example would be contagious, then he miscalculated,\u201d Lavrov told a news conference Monday.\n\nIn Russia\u2019s upper parliament, Andrei Klimov, the deputy head of the Committee on International Affairs, suggested that Russia should respond by reducing visas issued to U.S. citizens.\n\n\u201cThe legitimate rights of our citizens must be defended, so if there are any infringements on our citizens, then mirror measures should also be introduced against the citizens of the United States,\u201d Klimov said, according to Interfax, a Russian news agency.\n\nKlimov\u2019s counterpart in Russia\u2019s lower house of parliament, called the Duma, blamed the United States for the nosedive in relations.\n\n\u201cIt always comes from the American side,\u201d Leonid Slutsky, who chairs the Duma\u2019s international affairs committee, posted on the Russian social media site VKontakte. \u201cWe believe it is testament to Washington\u2019s mood to further accelerate the deterioration of relations with Moscow.\u201d", "images":
