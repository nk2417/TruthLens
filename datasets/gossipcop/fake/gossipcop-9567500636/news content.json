Elsa admitted, at times his success was hard for her as a lot had changed for them as a couple.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s difficult when you go from being an unknown person to a very known person and all the changes that come with that,\u2019 she revealed.\n\nThe Fast And The Furious actress also spoke to ELLE about how her career changed as soon as she became a mother.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s interesting how you can be a successful woman who has been working her whole life, and then you have kids and suddenly your career isn\u2019t as important and you don\u2019t appreciate it as much, and you just think: \u201cWhat am I doing? I have been fighting all my life for this and now I don\u2019t know if I really want it?,\u201d\u2019 she admitted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow the roles have reversed, and her career is back in form, how will Chris manage his wife in the spotlight?
