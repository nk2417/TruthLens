Almost on a constant basis, one can find false reports claiming that Blake and Gwen are getting married, or that they have already split up. Initially, Shelton found these reports so infuriating that they would get \u201cunder his skin,\u201d making him feel angry about how the media was exploiting their relationship for their interests.\n\nBut it appears Shelton cannot be bothered anymore. The source close to him said that one day he \u201cjust decided he can\u2019t be bothered,\u201d and that he has become \u201cimmune\u201d to Gwen Stefani pregnancy rumors. He has reportedly adopted a view that most of the stories about the couple are patently untrue and it is not something which he should actually get worked up about.\n\nEven a brief glance into news stories about Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton\u2019s relationship justifies this behavior. Just a few days into the new year, OK! Magazine published a story in which it was reported that the couple got married in an \u201cintimate backyard ceremony just days before Christmas.\u201d Moreover, the magazine asserted that the marriage had \u201cjust 27 of the couple\u2019s nearest and dearest gathered in Gwen\u2019s back garden,\u201d and only cost the couple $23,000.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GossipCop/status/998549047316271104\n\nLater, the same magazine wrongly claimed that Gwen Stefani was pregnant with Shelton\u2019s child \u2014 a story which was debunked by other news sites. Such false reports about the couple led Shelton to tweet out to his fans, asking them not to believe everything that they read about the pair in the media.\n\n\u201c99 percent of the things you read about [me] on social media or the internet isn\u2019t true. It\u2019s actually disturbing. I rarely even look at it anymore because I know it\u2019s mostly fake.\u201d\n\nIn his tweet, he wrote that he felt \u201cdisturbed\u201d with the false news reports, now the change in his attitude is evident from the fact that while performing at his restaurant Ole Red in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, he joked with audience members about them being \u201cvery lucky\u201d that particular night because Gwen Stefani was joining him for a duet, even though she \u201cactually gave birth to twins yesterday.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2421769f-57a4-4bff-913f-cf316747493e.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5bec4241e7af34802168fd95f3240eba?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20157'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20492%20142'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo-white.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent-Dark-Mode.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20120%20120'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/gwen-stefani-pregnant-rumors-dont-bother-blake-shelton-says-source", "title": "Gwen Stefani Pregnancy Rumors Don\u2019t Bother Blake Shelton, Says Source", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.png", "description": "Rumors suggesting that Gwen Stefani is pregnant do not bother Blake Shelton anymore, a source close to him told Gossip Cop.", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Gwen Stefani Pregnancy Rumors Don\u2019t Bother Blake Shelton, Says Source - Inquisitr News", "description": "Rumors suggesting that Gwen Stefani is pregnant do not bother Blake Shelton anymore, a source close to him told Gossip Cop.", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/gwen-stefani-pregnant-rumors-dont-bother-blake-shelton-says-source", "site_name": "Inquisitr News"}, "article": {"tag": "Gwen Stefani", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-05-21T11:01:00-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Gwen Stefani Pregnancy Rumors Don\u2019t Bother Blake Shelton, Says Source - Inquisitr News", "description": "Rumors suggesting that Gwen Stefani is pregnant do not bother Blake Shelton anymore, a source close to him told Gossip Cop.", "site": "@theinquisitr", "creator": "@theinquisitr"}, "generator": "WP Rocket 3.18.3"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526914860.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
