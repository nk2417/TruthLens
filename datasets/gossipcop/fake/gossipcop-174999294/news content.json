All The Baby Rumors Over Nearly 20 Years Source: Getty Jovita Trujillo Jan. 3 2019, Updated 7:19 p.m. ET\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nNot all women want to have children, and that's perfectly OK. While \"normal\" people are pressured by friends and family to get pregnant, celebrities are pressured by the whole world. And compared to other celebs, nobody has been more publicly pressured than Jennifer Aniston. The world is obsessed with her having a baby! MORE: JENNIFER ANISTON'S AND JUSTIN THEROUX'S DOG CUSTODY BATTLE It seems like no one has been reported pregnant more times than Jen.The earliest reports date back to 1999, back when the world first fell in love with her on Friends and she began dating Brad Pitt. Since 1999 there have been more than 55 published articles about her being pregnant both in and outside the U.S. It was even reported by the Huffington Post that despite the possibility that the U.S would go into war \"Jennifer Aniston Pregnant\" was still searched more than \"are we at war\" on Google.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nJennifer did express in early interviews that she wanted to become a mother one day and from then on the world was waiting. The obsession with her character on Friends\u2014and the fact that Rachel did get pregnant\u2014could be the reason why fans kept a close eye on is she or isn't she in real life. In fact, the roles Jennifer took on in her career often had a direct impact on when and how her pregnancy rumors evolved.\n\nOver time the extremity of the rumors changed, but many of the triggers are the same. Rumors start any time she is wearing a loose shirt or looks \"bloated,\" whenever she is in a new relationship, and whenever that relationship ends. And most importantly, the rumors evolve as she ages.

Sources say \"Jen said she's enjoying the thought that at any moment she could be expecting. That's why her first thoughts on the morning she was hit were of the baby she hoped she was carrying.

The cover of a popular tabloid revealed that not only was Jennifer \"having John's babies\" but she was having secret fertility treatments.

Doctor And Or Brad Help Jennifer Get Pregnant\n\nIn 2009, Jennifer started filming The Switch which was about a woman hitting her biological clock and her decision to use a sperm donor to get pregnant.

One claimed she was pregnant with twins, but they both shared the same story that a doctor helped her and John was ecstatic. The couple broke up that year and the obsession with her pregnancy continued with some interesting spins. While Brad was married to Angelina rumors about a love triangle swirled.

The rumors and body shaming got so bad that Jennifer addressed them at a press conference in October. She declared, \"Rumor number one: I am not planning to get married any time soon ... And rumor number two: no, we're not pregnant ... It's just I quit smoking, so I've gained a couple of pounds.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n2012: Jennifer Aniston And Justin Theroux: It\u2019s Baby Time!\n\nSource: Getty\n\nOnce Jennifer entered her 40s the rumors were centered even more around her age and if she could get pregnant at all.

In May, it was reported that she had frozen her eggs at the age of 43 and was going to be a mom with the help of her doctor. Later that same year things went international with her next pregnancy rumor and a source was cited saying she was \u201cscared to death that making a huge public deal over her pregnancy might jinx her. It took her years to get pregnant, and she\u2019s aware of the complications that could arise because of her age, so she and Justin have decided to keep silent as they prepare for the baby\u2019s arrival.\u201d The source also claimed that Jennifer and Justin were going to get married in Africa.

Jen addressed the rumors directly again with an essay published in the Huffington Post: \u201cI am not pregnant. What I am is fed up. I\u2019m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body shaming that occurs daily under the guise of \u2018journalism,\u2019 the \u2018First Amendment\u2019 and \u2018celebrity news.'\u201d\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n2017: Jen\u2019s Miracle Baby Joy At 48\n\nWhen Jennifer was 48-years-old, headlines about her reported pregnancy with Justin often included the word \"miracle.\" According to a gossip magazine, \u201cThe couple made the surprise announcement to family and friends last week, revealing their \u2018one last attempt\u2019 to fall pregnant had given them the miracle news they had been waiting for.\" The rumors went further and another source contended \u201cJen\u2019s pregnancy may turn to double joy,\u201d because \u201cthe couple had been investigating adopting a baby from Puerto Rico\u201d following Hurricane Maria. There was never a baby or an adoption and Jennifer spoke out\u2014again\u2014about the rumors. \u201cI would say, I think the best one would be a picture of me with a hand over my stomach, saying \u2018Finally Pregnant!\u2019\u201d she explained. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s like they take a picture of you and create this story. If your body is in a normal moment of having had a bite or two, or you\u2019re having a moment of bloat, then there\u2019s arrows circled around your stomach, telling you that you\u2019re pregnant. And it\u2019s like, actually no, it\u2019s just my body. Not that it\u2019s any of your business to begin with. Having a child, as we know, is no one\u2019s business except the couple or individual that\u2019s going through it.\" Despite her plea, rumors started again in 2017 that Jennifer hired a surrogate.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n2018: Jennifer Aniston Pregnant With Brad Pitt\u2019s Baby\n\nSource: Getty", "images": ["http://okmagazine.com/ok_logo_black_small.png", "data:image/webp;base64,UklGRhQHAABXRUJQVlA4IAgHAAAQeQCdASogA5ABP73c5W2/tbAto1NaM/A3iWlu357yRMhtRjy2v/av44igX//ewdjS86fYDkVjanTGOfOuNc+ALHHqE89R6lL48v0glmLVqcuL0BJ/IDm3t8Ag57G41z2atqhZKmPVIkI55Uq0bolYSzLYCX6ks/fMx9rrn+FCrlFJh5VJ9h8puaQgWpQcXxUxbXkKr/8PDRhowCLgUgcJY2p5K4wAvyAlCOtk74LOzs70AOAw9cs0wSb8BRGNCx1cS3DndhakoGEKsHB2K4jHB/c2b5QYnjMyAH+qGjNOFuZAhmIH3oTUIWlPG2Lzy9nQtjmCX0M9v6xY6xkFqwbP73Xt92a9YMUHzvteGoDP9YDP4rScucdT5f8dgf1OArB6y515OFTCDqdTk5BT5PNZoBtZmPbA1pdLTmU2wsb7bbiDsikrj8/QBjNFCMC9ZN4WN2qVTR2UJFxSIoheY4UIDClTJjea6MoO+7lBA1Jzu1dHaSGOluaKbPVNO3DsWty48H1KCzAl8L7hL/R3Bn3p8+lyWhaq/5qzscKFszvDJuL9wYJJKh6yqzx+mpY2rc0mJe4WPTj/YHuNZAEgCEjKCjnLBmZaNyj0XsUaDPf+Cx6cf21EvAOApg5mUpMZQd6B6eTj0z7tqi4ngBTPDMPgIijh4fvfQFkAkLzpkdMWT1A+ZNIgT2ffttuBtqJGYeepzY2o2IRwNZMzwzWp98WlYLRzDM11dnHoU6PDcLCLDgMzsO1BD1nPe7DZ8L3zmr5uVX2qZ+H7Zpt0Y2N6G6DIe15DdwAfwa/NmPB5/cGS+4xORRTqpIQ87bGyueptSJBHKPc7Umru8XzSN2iKIr63ZukAkG4X3ANwn1p9RVOy3caHqX1l04HCxAn8HF6miSBYlE0fim/JEwCyV24MwrAs6Gx/XQEmK82Tm5v18oC+lAfIK3FFAvkBJijdwk1uR1FakKL3ejTv+M9SAlnUJMCm319j5PCLV+uZ1TIHSXtUO7cq/xcq/n5WC9i/TYduWaPIJJZ886OP9gNbVSKqKEwkqwuNcS7uxEHM3CFqw1EEuexICx6bpnJH+v8Fi2KP9EkEZxL77QVo40YMvjoK2A/rNWNAxDmyTtktFHijEmhtyHU+4eh4H5aiym9rHWvfnfLe9znbPgIQHiBexzD/UXUtihuMHu6OgDWfm6dZKnXY3urQmGL66hd4/MEJ8dFmHPNQ9yH47BFhbMltNO3Qq4l9/ZXd+McIJ4zG/yifhQp8JB5Q4Hqpg1mrKlpgJ46YE1g8nE1i3oboDDlZPQlx/A9YAAD+zpfjDZma7CNUiK9Sa64IeeoKUCGIrSNP+dAklEoIiI/QdEgO73zv69doxI5iuphfIWqZM1ODfTe6b8fEqc0zd085GrATR4RcHea9AweEFrNFOC1kWiai5Ob2oaCDIAA8HV2UBI5rHWUmtMxbBFcaeBHHgIVSC+g007ofKuEQ2gOjW6HXlDzpJvw/NrDNYwkwa1P2GrCsuR3f2uo5gTuJmoudD+VP3MNOYyp0+JWCKsYxOX90cJI3uQhGDqxkRJCNpgSbhgJSTn+WOgAJrpKiFr5A2wQBbc61zReVRTDb3QJ3IMD9SsybTdZR7CMqqKzopK5to3ZaEEDGI8hWAPPnG4/DFH5rJqNHdhbJqIy9DyamMiwQBnft2f3mreNptDJy4Bakdppfi9lIC5BQEHiHLNubIgPMzzpZqVqpphAQVqGSAIA8a61VdFsGYX8LhPPPYHHaXB3VA54F2Qq41xVlX34+IlcSNWmC0VcNB5TlLHDAElKPTYa1Be+W/QUVCYfYQ2eEfMLWo0t78AMMzPioThCp1Oc1CmgVWjTARoNIAKfIvZmd/cqc17XzMxoNI48UH2zAjUR0yoBxkq4hxCwycuVkiACD+VaovMGJ/FrcBxbQSFRB0ozi9lvtRe2dN0zVwmR/hNcPvSDnEeVkYi/Qk9Hz0mbkwjJEgmU785X2LSYf76Jhlv8+nmMHepPWNGtJ/2xAQAwM3JQTiBC8KGqsBgkB56rwAzabu/HkOEM5Dm4Zul02YPDy8HeVo3en97DgaiB5u8M4Z1S7RL7eLggvmQ2CU9JjcQ/tO/dJ5Nk2QfP3xKxknQ1R4957fhBBhLZIe+u0U88ZmwI5qUG6iahGncypyUoONUGIg6TmgghOYR0PDVg7bFVbr9kOcNpb62vtNALqsZvkU4ddmDcGtnrOrbtNE4oC8fbXYH+kvrm/YZfx+hVjNaL5tdLnOqMGdU/w2glw3gVkcydiygDajVij8bjikuwLIofmwSwdQa7Q/EDE5e7pG516YCvvH6P9flQccYuCmJGnGPoYIeUC+2SAeXb6iq/km3HTJ0DJJSLEZhVUJEWt10grnTE6wbzyMXln8wkAAAA=", "http://okmagazine.com/icons/x_black.svg", "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/DdSfTsdw9/0x0/2018/04/jnnifer-and-justin-2011.jpg", "http://okmagazine.com/talk-bubble.svg", "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/XRbRae-TY/0x0/2018/04/jennifer-aniston-pregnant-14-09-1.jpg", "http://okmagazine.com/icons/email_black.svg", "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/qOCbaUiyR/0x0/2018/04/GettyImages-96331147.jpg", "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/gk2cEeler/0x0/2018/04/Jennifer-aniston-and-brad-pit-1999-pic.jpg", "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/o2WrIWpAa/1200x628/2018/04/Jennifer-aniston-pregnant-featured-image.jpg", "http://okmagazine.com/ok_logo_white.png", "http://okmagazine.com/icons/facebook_black.svg", "http://okmagazine.com/ok_logo_black.png", "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/sFuYzDIwK/0x0/2018/04/jennifer-aniston-pregnant-11-10.jpg", "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/fgpKF3BIc/0x0/2018/04/2002.jpg", "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/Cf191N2TB/0x0/2018/04/jennifer-aniston-gerard.jpg", "http://okmagazine.com/icons/flipboard_black.svg", "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/r8caDM334/0x0/2018/04/Jenn-and-Justin-at-oscars.jpg", "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/_6oyKZ6LF/0x0/2018/04/jennifer-aniston-pregnant-09-12.jpg", "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/uVQtgipQv/0x0/2018/04/GettyImages-511915384.jpg", "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/pEFqF09kr/0x0/2018/04/Jennifer-and-John-Mayer.jpg", "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/OivlU3Meu/0x0/2018/04/jennifer-aniston-vince-vaughn.jpg", "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/JtGFZiFN9/0x0/2018/04/GettyImages-105586333-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/o2WrIWpAa/1200x628/2018/04/Jennifer-aniston-pregnant-featured-image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jovita Trujillo"], "canonical_link": "https://okmagazine.com/photos/jennifer-aniston-pregnant-all-rumors-no-babies/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston's Pregnant!
