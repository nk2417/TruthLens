But enough fans tweeted the sighting that it appears to have been legitimate.\n\nTwihards don\u2019t get your hopes up though on the pair reigniting their relationship, as Kristen officially came out last year during an episode of SNL, where she revealed she is \u2018like, so gay\u2019.\n\nSpeaking with People on her decision to come out during the show, she said: \u2018Considering I had so many eyes on me, I suddenly realized [my private life] affects a greater number of people than just me.\n\n\u2018It was an opportunity to surrender a bit of what was mine, to make even one other person feel good about themselves.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018It just seemed important, and topical.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
