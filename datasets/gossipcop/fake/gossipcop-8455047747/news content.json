In Camilla\u2019s day, only women of aristocratic blood married into the royal family \u2013 so seeing \u201cCommoner Kate\u201d and soap actress Meghan marry their way in has incensed her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She likes to cause trouble for them, and bringing in Angelina is just another way to ruffle a few feathers,\u2019 the source adds.\n\nAccording to the source Kate is devastated over Camilla and Ange\u2019s meetings and really feels like they are betraying her.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s seen them growing closer and closer and it\u2019s really left her unsettled because she knows how conniving Camilla can be. Kate knows the pair are capable of anything, and has been told by several palace aides to watch Camilla and Ange closely,\u2019 the insider spills.\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShockingly, Ian Halperin, author of Brangelina: The Untold Story Of Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie, accuses the Maleficent actress of wanting to \u2018infiltrate\u2019 the royal family.\n\nIn the book, Ian claimed that Angelina studied Princess Diana in \u2018minute detail\u2019 and has always wanted to continue the work of the late princess. He even claimed one friend suggested Angelina had a \u2018secret ambition to marry into the royal family\u2019, and alleged \u2018Prince Andrew is on her radar\u2019.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s a woman with an agenda. She wants to leave the US and work in the UK. She wants to get in the House of Lords, she has a non-profit foundation there. She has her sights set on England,\u2019 Ian told the Daily Star.\n\nRelated: Camilla and Angelina\u2019s shock plot exposed\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated: Camilla attacks Meghan\n\nRelated: Camilla\u2019s $12 million tell-all rocks the Queen and Prince Charles", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d683f9a7086cf5b4d843157e497fddc673a3321799da7d0d3a9507a9b5e7998e?s=128&d=mm&r=g", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/chrissie-swan-the-shortcut-queen-691e509abfe28.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-20t164344.876-691eaa9997406.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-13t111849.371-691523f39f6e6.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/131299/kate-middleton-style-1.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/04/New-Header-2.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/Logo-1.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/29992/gettyimages-972331406.jpg?resize=1024%2C972", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/untitled-design-2025-11-13t155101.395-691563c9075e3.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/131095/untitled-design-2023-11-08t103411331.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/icon-phosphor-circle.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/07/NIFLOGO_Organge.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-18t171832.263-691c0fd21ad3d.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/ni2546pm1_marketing-cover_v0.1-691a9098143bf-scaled.jpg?resize=1955%2C2560", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/air-fryer-1-691eadfe53bed.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920-x-1080-11-6916b87c8e3c7.png?resize=380%2C200", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/29993/gettyimages-450496248.jpg?resize=1024%2C683", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-20t100612.179-691e4d7618296.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-14t092603.688-69165b0bdf11b.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/untitled-design-43-691557d7aea0d.jpg?resize=380%2C285"], "top_img": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nikki Black", "Nikki Is Obsessed With All Things Celebrity", "Dreams She Is A Long-Lost Kardashian.
