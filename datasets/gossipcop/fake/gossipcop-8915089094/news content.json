Last fall Jenner hired Nierob, who has handled crisis PR for some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest names including Robert Downey Jr. and Mel Gibson, for help in guiding her through a storm of media attention as she came out as transgender. Nierob declined to comment on this story.\n\nSources close to the situation said Jenner turned to Nierob for a very specific reason \u2014 one that is poignant in light of the turns in Jenner\u2019s life today. In the mid-1980s, Nierob helped Jenner at a moment of crisis when a reporter for the New York Times was pursuing a story about Jenner being a cross-dresser.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAt the time, Jenner was on the rebound from a career downturn and was enjoying a new round of endorsement deals and media gigs. In the mid-1980s, a story about the Olympic decathlon star dressing in women\u2019s clothing would have severely damaged, if not destroyed, Jenner\u2019s public image.\n\nJenner had previously been repped by Rogers & Cowan around the time of his 1976 Olympic triumph but never by Nierob. The two knew each other through mutual associates. In the early 1980s Jenner worked for ABC and NBC covering auto racing at a time when Nierob represented star driver Danny Sullivan.\n\nWhen Jenner was approached by the Times with questions about cross-dressing, Jenner confided in Nierob about her gender dysphoria condition. Nierob was never formally hired as Jenner\u2019s rep \u2014 he helped her out as a friend. Nierob worked briefly but intensely with Jenner\u2019s then-manager and attorney to dissuade the Times reporter from pursuing the story. He used all the PR pressure tricks: strenuous denials, questioning the motives of his sources and emphasizing the ramifications of such a story for Jenner and his family. No story ever ran.\n\nThirty-odd years later, Jenner turned to Nierob for help on the journey to becoming Caitlyn because of the level of trust between them. Jenner felt Nierob never betrayed the confidence and never gossiped in Hollywood circles about the incident.\n\nWork on the campaign to explain Jenner\u2019s transformation began late last fall when Nierob reached out to Diane Sawyer for what he knew would be a landmark TV moment for public awareness of the transgender community. He knew it had to be serious and substantive to dispel any suggestion that the emergence of Caitlyn was a publicity stunt.\n\nSawyer\u2019s work on the Jenner interview began at an emotional time for the ABC News anchor, following the November death of her husband, director Mike Nichols.\n\nAfter the April 24 \u201c20/20\u201d interview generated rave reviews and 17 million viewers, the first promotion for Jenner\u2019s upcoming E! docu-series, which was officially announced during Sawyer\u2019s interview, began to hit.\n\nThe June 1 release of the Vanity Fair cover, which revealed Jenner\u2019s new name and look, coincided with the launch of her @Caitlyn_Jenner twitter account. Jenner racked up more than 1 million followers in a few hours, a new Twitter record, and had more than 2 million as of Friday.\n\nOn Tuesday ESPN announced that Jenner would receive the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the July 15 ESPY Awards. That will be followed by the July 26 premiere of E!\u2019s \u201cI Am Cait,\u201d which runs eight episodes. The series will chronicle Jenner\u2019s transformation over the past few months and also show her on a new mission to be an advocate for public understanding and tolerance of transgender community concerns.\n\nIn fact, sources said Jenner has been on the road this week shooting material for \u201cI Am Cait\u201d and hasn\u2019t had much time to catch up with the latest round of coverage.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing it,\u201d a source close to Jenner says. \u201cShe\u2019s not sitting at home reading her own press. She\u2019s on a mission to save lives and make a difference.\u201d", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/caitlin-jenner-media-strategy.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/caitlin-jenner-media-strategy.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cynthia Littleton", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/bruce-jenner-caitlyn-jenner-transition-new-york-times-story-1201513335/", "title": "The Secret Mastermind Behind Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s Transformation", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The media campaign surrounding Bruce Jenner\u2019s public transformation into Caitlyn Jenner has been nothing short of masterful", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Cynthia Littleton", "tags": "Bruce Jenner, caitlyn jenner", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "The Secret Mastermind Behind Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s Transformation", "url": "https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/bruce-jenner-caitlyn-jenner-transition-new-york-times-story-1201513335/", "description": "The media campaign surrounding Bruce Jenner\u2019s public transformation into Caitlyn Jenner has been nothing short of masterful", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/caitlin-jenner-media-strategy.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Caitlin Jenner Media Strategy"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-06-05T20:18:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-06-06T10:38:19+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The media campaign surrounding Bruce Jenner\u2019s public transformation into Caitlyn Jenner has been nothing short of masterful", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@Variety_Cynthia", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Secret Mastermind Behind Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s Transformation", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/caitlin-jenner-media-strategy.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1433535517.0, "source": "http://variety.com", "summary": ""}
