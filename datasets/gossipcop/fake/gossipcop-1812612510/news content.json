In an excerpt published by The Telegraph, Scobie recounted the timeline of events surrounding Meghan and Prince Harry's eviction from Frogmore Cottage, and according to the author, it wasn't King Charles decision alone.\n\n\n\nGetty\n\nApparently, Harry's aunt Princess Anne \"persuaded Charles to withdraw the use\" of the residence by the couple who are no longer working royals. Scobie wrote that the Princess Royal was \u201cat the forefront of the supporters of the firm approach\u201d to evict them, while Prince Edward, on the other hand, was \"uneasy\" about the Palace's decision. In the end, Harry and Meghan were sent a letter from Sir Michael John Stevens, the Keeper of the Privy Purse, urging them to hand back the keys to the cottage, which was a wedding gift from the late Queen Elizabeth and had recently undergone a $3 million renovation.\n\n\n\nGetty\n\nAccording to Scobie, the Sussexes were \"shocked\" by the news, prompting Harry to call Charles about his decision. During the heated phone call, Harry reportedly asked his father: \"Don't you want to see your grandchildren?\" His question was met with silence by Charles, who later promised his son that his family would always have \"somewhere\" to stay when they visited the U.K.\n\n\n\nScobie shared his own feelings about the unprecedented move by Charles, writing: \u201cStaying mum about Harry\u2019s accusations and remaining publicly unconcerned for his son\u2019s well-being while ending his family\u2019s lease on a safe U.K. residence was not a decisive action by a resolute King; it was a cheap shot from a wounded father bound by an institutional system that is often intolerant of human emotion.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.instyle.com/thmb/fVQnNpeF3g8a7ZDIk9iQwPduLt4=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(642x468:644x470)/GettyImages-8301181742-ad5d36c6a3114263b1305ea58106c36b.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/QVogTc11ygwrBSSPezkcML-vidQ=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(2328x1601:2330x1603)/MeghanMarklePrinceHarryLead-871b74f72d984ca2b70f2e5785fc0b9f.jpeg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/4-dWZ-aFwM5fJ-u9vC9qa-CSNnA=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1601x588:1603x590)/HarryMeghanLead-43ab7c3183534ec79738eced74dbf825.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/IYLACSqHk4lPkp3OTvt93hJ4BcE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1178551536-78f751fa67114aeda9f4ffc96b11db99.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/VzDhwdzxQH1u1O3bkYBjklN1t3E=/200x200/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/alicia-brunker-portrait-1-10153946d1c0473b8f6406e635d0db5a.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/rpYyZx0RHy9698V6FOhAXoGGKJ4=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1909x539:1911x541)/GettyImages-2198402678-486f56c97da0421da7ace9424ac44538.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/oghmMc2E2WxEfIWXFJCKJMJe0_s=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1273x977:1275x979)/Sarah-Ferguson-Prince-Andrew-Lead-a470033dc3ef4bb0a8a361ce1f5a9405.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/0WAUAXrStrJdmRfTin995n3kg_I=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1299x0:1301x2)/GettyImages-2211111499-02e5821912564d6ca4be11a4e70fa9e6.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/56hX9QG6Ylly9BhGQ9tLB9vbg4k=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(806x0:808x2)/GettyImages-1488336827-c9d71715a7184cb7905a72813c18f04b.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/PBOnqV-Lv1GgyxNr13u-p4kk6oo=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1499x0:1501x2)/GettyImages-2198624849-b53c9cbed8804f0b95f225b1473f7f74.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/_9QYLnZMz2ZO9050W2lBrSQJGu4=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(2157x2593:2159x2595)/Meghan-Markle-Lead-a92a8e5bf2374dfd85e782dc46d11eea.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/Ke1BLSwIGbQLP-Vb8DpmZXe1thg=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1688x1270:1690x1272)/VictoriaLead-f6d1d26a7294426788d6ec3336433bab.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/t2SpIF6PF8isEfAyFWEzI1IhFFo=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1254x0:1256x2)/PrinceHarryMeghanMarkleLead-b1634d41b924458297dc9300266c7f4e.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/LSM6zL_gjFtkFgx1Url6BBKn2jU=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(2286x0:2288x2)/GettyImages-2151728100-c1f779adf3b6416fb151575d6157400e.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/7fzGi8ldFiBaBDLkCvP5hoOnXAY=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(921x0:923x2)/GettyImages-129045675-700a9773d221408dadaba6e6f2e04900.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/4nyuu-LiE-Xdl8BaNLDD-4rs2bM=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1545x0:1547x2)/MeghanMarkleLead-ffe380d987834108bf6100cb6846373e.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/2kB9ctZ6bW26__uaWstLyRs8dMM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1243362130-2bb5927cd8234534a5d41efc8fd8d64d.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/eo6kD9MY_scPYNRysY_yvkKLllg=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1131x897:1133x899)/MeghanLead-408449001ae74f7f98336f9500ec4435.jpg", "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/hXqcSDkzPmfW25sHIuWJXc78imQ=/570x426/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(621x747:623x749)/AnneLead-c5c69f735db24e0f8e4b34d54aef3f52.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.instyle.com/thmb/2kB9ctZ6bW26__uaWstLyRs8dMM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1243362130-2bb5927cd8234534a5d41efc8fd8d64d.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alicia Brunker", "Alicia Brunker Is A Writer Who Covers Celebrity", "Royal", "Fashion News For Instyle.Com.
