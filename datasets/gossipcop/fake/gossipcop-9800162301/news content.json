{"url": "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_%2770s_Show", "text": "American television sitcom\n\nThat '70s Show is an American television teen sitcom that aired on Fox from August 23, 1998, to May 18, 2006. The series focuses on the lives of a group of six teenage friends living in the fictional town of Point Place, Wisconsin, from 1976 to 1979.[1] The ensemble cast features Topher Grace, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson, Laura Prepon, Wilmer Valderrama, Lisa Robin Kelly, Debra Jo Rupp, Kurtwood Smith, Don Stark, Tommy Chong, and Tanya Roberts.\n\nIn 1999, the show was remade for the ITV network in the United Kingdom as Days Like These using almost verbatim scripts with minor changes to cultural references.[2] A sequel series, That '90s Show, set in 1995 and focusing on the children of the main characters of the original show, was released on Netflix from 2023 to 2024.\n\nPremise [ edit ]\n\nThe Circle illustrated the teens' marijuana use, usually in Eric's basement. The image is of the final scene of the series.\n\nSetting and timeline [ edit ]\n\nThe show was set in May 1976 in the August 23, 1998 premiere. After 12 episodes, the series transitioned to 1977. The 23rd episode, \"Grandma's Dead\", was also set in 1976, because it was the 12th episode that was produced, and was originally, going to air earlier in the debut season. The show remained in 1977 for the next two seasons. Near the end of the third season, the series transitioned to 1978 until early in the sixth season. The remaining episodes took place in 1979, and the series finale abruptly ends during a New Year's Eve party as the characters reach \"one\" during a countdown to January 1, 1980.[3] After the credits roll, the license plate from Eric's Vista Cruiser is shown with the year \"80\", indicating that the 1980s have begun.[citation needed]\n\nThe series has gained some notoriety due to perceived continuity errors present in its timeline. Although it is implied that one year passes in congruence with each season of the series, the characters remain of high school age from the beginning of the series until the conclusion of season five. Additionally, characters can be seen listening to albums that would have not yet been released at the time of the episode's setting.[4]\n\nThemes and references [ edit ]\n\nThe show is a 1970s nostalgia sitcom.[5] The show addressed numerous social issues of the 1970s such as sexual attitudes of the era, generational conflict, the economic hardships of the 1970s recession, mistrust of the American government by blue-collar workers, and underage drinking/drug use. The series also highlighted developments in fashion trends,[6] the entertainment industry, including the television remote (\"the clicker\"), reruns, VCRs, and cable TV; the video games Pong and Space Invaders; the cassette tape and Disco; MAD magazine; and Eric's obsession with Star Wars, which came out in 1977.[7] The show has been compared to Happy Days, which was similarly set 20 years before the time in which it aired.[8] Many of the show's episodes featured Eric and the rest of the kids in or around Eric's \"Aztec Gold\" 1969 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser, handed down to Eric by Red in the pilot episode (after Red begrudgingly buys a 1976 Toyota Corolla, a more economical car).[citation needed]\n\nThe series also contains references to the popular music of the 1970s, such as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Alice Cooper, Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, KISS, The Grateful Dead, and The Steve Miller Band. Additionally, the series featured cameos from prominent rock musicians such as Nugent himself, as well as Roger Daltrey of the Who.[9]\n\nRunning gags and catchphrases [ edit ]\n\nIn one of the show's major running gags, Red often threatens to punish Eric with many variations of the catchphrase, \"my foot in your ass\" or more generally \"kicking your ass.\"[10]\n\nSome other notable running gags and catchphrases are:\n\nFormat [ edit ]\n\nThat 70's Show featured a multi-camera setup and was filmed before a live studio audience with canned laughter. In \"The Circle,\" a group of characters, usually the teenagers, sit in a circle (generally in Eric's basement, though occasionally elsewhere), as the camera pans, stopping at each character as they speak. It was usually apparent that the characters are under the influence of marijuana. Thick clouds of smoke, frequent coughing and an extreme wide-angle lens added to the \"drug-induced\" feel, although the audience never saw anyone actually smoking the drug. Also, no visible drug-related paraphernalia were seen, such as bongs or rolling papers. Characters never spoke the word \"marijuana\" while in The Circle (except in one episode, \"Reefer Madness\"), often referring to it as \"stuff\" or a \"stash\". In the episode \"Bye-Bye Basement\", Theo (Leo's cousin) refers to \"weed\"; in \"The Relapse\", Kelso tells Fez that the concrete wall behind the gym is used mostly for \"smoking weed and beating up freshmen;\" in \"Ski Trip\" Kitty asks Eric why he is taking so much oregano to Jackie's ski lodge; in \"Eric's Burger Job\", Kelso blames his \"roach clip\" when the water bed on which he is sitting at a party deflates; in two episodes (\"That Wrestling Show\" and \"Hyde Moves In\"), Eric and Hyde can be seen wearing shirts with the words \"Cannabis sativa\" written on a Campbell's soup can; and in \"The Pill\", Red, referring to Kelso, exclaims, \"That kid's on dope!\" A gimmick related to the circle and the marijuana smoking was Eric watching the kitchen wall moving erratically, although this technique was also used to show that Eric was drunk.[citation needed]\n\nAs the series progressed, The Circle became one of the series' recurring features. The only four episodes where the whole gang is in The Circle are \"Class Picture\", \"I'm A Boy\", \"Substitute\", and in the series finale. During the eighth and final season, The Circle (sans the smoke) replaced the Formans' Vista Cruiser as the setting of the opening credits.[citation needed]\n\nBeginning with season 5, each episode in the series is named after a song by a rock band that was famous in the 1970s: Led Zeppelin (season 5), The Who (season 6), The Rolling Stones (season 7), and Queen (season 8, except for the finale, titled \"That '70s Finale\").[21]\n\nFor the first seven seasons of the show, the show's introduction showed the cast inside the Vista Cruiser.[22] The particular station wagon was ultimately bought by Wilmer Valderrama at the show's conclusion from Carsey-Werner for \"no more than\" $500.[22]\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nThe working titles for the show were:\n\nRequests to use the titles of songs by The Who were rejected, and though Feelin' All Right was used as the title of the show during its upfront presentation, Fox later decided it would not be memorable enough. Bonnie Turner proposed simply calling it That '70s Show, predicting that audiences would merely refer to it by its setting anyway.[23]\n\nMila Kunis lied about her age to get her role as Jackie Burkhart in the series. She was 14 years old, though the show required its actors to be 18.[24]\n\nEric Forman was written out of the series at the end of the seventh season, as Topher Grace wanted to move on with his career.[25] Ashton Kutcher switched to a recurring guest role when he also chose to depart following the seventh season.[25] However, Kelso had not been written out yet, so to give better closure to the character, Kutcher appeared in the first four episodes of the eighth season (credited as a special guest star). Wilmer Valderrama recalled: \"When they made the decision \u2014 which was completely, 100 percent fine, because after eight years I think it's OK to say you want out \u2014 we looked at it and said, 'Do we still have a show?' And it's such an amazing ensemble. Every single one of us has our character down, so we knew there were a lot of lines to explore.\"[26]\n\nBoth Grace and Kutcher returned for the series finale, although the former was uncredited. Tommy Chong (who began reappearing by late season 7 after a long absence) became a regular again to help fill Kelso's role as the dimwit of the group. Eric was supposed to be replaced by his new friend Charlie, played by Bret Harrison, as an \"innocent character\", who proved fairly popular with audiences, but the character was killed off after Harrison was offered a lead role in the series The Loop.[27]\n\nAnother new character named Randy Pearson, played by Josh Meyers (brother of Late Night host Seth Meyers), was introduced to take the place of both Eric and, to a lesser extent, Charlie.[28] Another new character, Samantha, a stripper played by Jud Tylor, was added as Hyde's wife for nine episodes. The location of the show's introductory theme song was changed from the Vista Cruiser to the circle.[citation needed]\n\nThe eighth season was announced as the final season of the show on January 17, 2006,[29] and \"That '70s Finale\" was filmed a month later on February 17, 2006, first airing on May 18, 2006.[30]\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nYoung cast [ edit ]\n\nOlder cast [ edit ]\n\nDebra Jo Rupp as Kitty Forman: Red's wife, mother of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde's informally adoptive mother, Kitty is a cheerful, doting mother, but can also be assertive when pushed. A nurse by profession, she drinks heavily and is a former smoker. Her major mood swings are usually attributed to menopause, although the lack of affection and attention from her daughter (Laurie) and her mother (Bea) is also partly to blame. She is also a nurturing mother figure to Eric's rather dysfunctional friends, especially Fez.\n\nKurtwood Smith as Red Forman: Kitty's husband, father of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde's adoptive father. Red is a conservative Navy combat veteran who served during both World War II and the Korean War. He is frequently hard on Eric and casually insults him, often calling him \"dumbass\", and finding ways to cheat Eric and his friends (especially Kelso) out of any cash they have. Despite his mean exterior, Red also displays a soft side. His hobbies include working with his power tools, drinking beer, watching television, reading the newspaper, hunting and fishing.\n\nLisa Robin Kelly (seasons 2\u20133; recurring season 1; special appearance season 5) and Christina Moore (recurring season 6) as Laurie Forman : Eric's manipulative and dishonest older sister. She flunked out of college during the first season and moves back home with her parents. Laurie enjoys tormenting Eric and manipulating her parents. She is promiscuous, often seen with various men, mainly Eric's friend Kelso, who cheats on his girlfriend Jackie, which eventually leads to Jackie physically assaulting Laurie. Eric, Hyde, and Donna often insult her for her promiscuity. She also has a strained relationship with her mother who thinks of her as a freeloader. She leaves the series during the third season, but returns in a recurring role during the fifth and sixth seasons. In season five, she marries Fez to prevent him from getting deported. She leaves the series part way through season 6 and is never seen again. During the seventh season, she is mentioned as having moved to Canada, where, as Eric puts it drolly, \"bottomless dancing is legal\".\n\n: Eric's manipulative and dishonest older sister.

Tanya Roberts as Midge Pinciotti (seasons 1\u20133; special guest appearance seasons 6\u20137): Bob's wife, Donna's mother, and Kitty's best friend, Midge is a woman about whom Eric and his male friends fantasize when coming of age. Although often dim-witted, she later adopts some feminist ideals. She is written out of the series in 2001 after the third season after divorcing Bob and moving to California, but returns in a limited guest appearance during the sixth and seventh seasons.\n\nDon Stark as Bob Pinciotti: Midge's husband and Donna's father. Bob often brags about his service in the National Guard, which invariably irritates Red, a veteran of two foreign wars. Bob is known for walking around his house with his robe wide open and no underwear. He eats constantly, even in bed. Bob is almost always in a good mood. His best friend is Red, who usually considers him to be a nuisance. He usually takes the brunt of Red's abuse in a jolly manner. After Midge divorces Bob in the fourth season, he begins dating Joanne (in seasons four and five) and Pam Burkhart (played by Brooke Shields replacing Eve Plumb from the first season), Jackie's mother (in seasons six and seven).\n\nTommy Chong as Leo (seasons 4 & 8; special guest seasons 2\u20133 & 7): A hippie, and the owner of a Foto Hut at which Hyde once worked, Leo is an Army veteran who served in World War II, where he was awarded a Purple Heart. Leo often puts play before work and maintains an easy-going attitude in most things, business included. He disappears during season four, but is later referenced in season five's \"The Battle of Evermore\" when the gang goes on a mission to find him, but with no luck. He returns in season seven and remains on the series until the show's end. In Season 8, he gets a new job working for Hyde at Grooves.\n\nEpisodes [ edit ]\n\nSeason Episodes Originally released First released Last released 1 25 August 23, 1998 ( ) July 26, 1999 ( 1999-07-26 ) 2 26 September 28, 1999 ( ) May 22, 2000 ( 2000-05-22 ) 3 25 October 3, 2000 ( ) May 22, 2001 ( 2001-05-22 ) 4 27 September 25, 2001 ( ) May 21, 2002 ( 2002-05-21 ) 5 25 September 17, 2002 ( ) May 14, 2003 ( 2003-05-14 ) 6 25 October 29, 2003 ( ) May 19, 2004 ( 2004-05-19 ) 7 25 September 8, 2004 ( ) May 18, 2005 ( 2005-05-18 ) 8 22 November 2, 2005 ( ) May 18, 2006 ( 2006-05-18 )\n\nIn other media [ edit ]\n\nHome media and streaming [ edit ]\n\nThat '70s Show was released on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment at an increment of two seasons per year between 2004 and 2008 and a complete series release on October 14, 2008.

That same year, a sublicensing deal for the show with streamer Netflix ended in the United States, with the deal ending globally in 2020.[34] In 2022, Carsey-Werner sublicensed it to NBCUniversal's streaming service Peacock.[34]\n\nSoundtracks [ edit ]\n\nSeveral prominent songs from the decade can be heard on the series, and two soundtracks were released in 1999. The first is a collection of funk, soul, and disco, called That '70s Album (Jammin'). The second is a collection of album-oriented rock songs, called That '70s Album (Rockin'). AllMusic gave both albums 3 out of 5 stars in their reviews.[35][36]\n\nRemake [ edit ]\n\nDays Like These [ edit ]\n\nRelated shows [ edit ]\n\nThat '80s Show [ edit ]\n\nThat '90s Show [ edit ]\n\nNetflix produced a spin-off of the series, titled That '90s Show, with Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp reprising their roles as Red and Kitty Forman, respectively.
