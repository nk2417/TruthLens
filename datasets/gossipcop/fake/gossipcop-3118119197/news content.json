You take the good with the bad,\u201d the Black Sabbath vocalist, 68, told Rolling Stone in a profile published on Thursday, September 14. \u201cYou take the good with the bad. When I was a crazy f\u2013ker, I\u2019m lucky she didn\u2019t walk out. Now I\u2019m coming on five years clean and sober, and I\u2019ve realized what a f\u2013king idiot I was. I mean, I\u2019m still nuts, but in control of it a bit more.\u201d\n\nOzzy then backtracked on his earlier joke. \u201cWhen I said, \u2018Don\u2019t get caught by your missus,\u2019 I\u2019m not proud of all that s\u2013t,\u201d he explained. \u201cI upset my wife and I upset my family and I made a lot of shock and shame.
