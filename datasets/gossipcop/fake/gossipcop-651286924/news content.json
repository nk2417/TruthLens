It's perfect,\" she told the BBC.\n\nThe redesign\n\nFollowing the birth of baby Archie in May of 2019, Prince Harry gave Meghan a third ring, an eternity band, which he reportedly designed with jeweler Lorraine Schwartz. Schwartz also resized and reset Meghan's engagement ring.\n\nMeghan debuted her redesigned three-stone engagement ring at Trooping the Colour this year. It now features a thin micro-pav\u00e9 band, as opposed to the original solid yellow gold one.\n\nSee a comparison of the two rings here:\n\nAlmay / Getty The photo on the left from Trooping the Colour shows Meghan\u2019s redesigned ring, with a thinner pave band.
