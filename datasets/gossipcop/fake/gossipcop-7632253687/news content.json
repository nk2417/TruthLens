Following four hours of deliberations, the jury unanimously decided Mueller assaulted Swift and awarded her $1.\n\nAs Gossip Cop reported, Mueller\u2019s lawsuit against Swift was dismissed Friday after a judge decided there was insufficient evidence to suggest she caused him to get fired from his radio hosting gig. The former DJ had filed a $3 million lawsuit against the singer, claiming she falsely accused him of grabbing her butt while posing for a photo backstage at one of her 2013 concerts, leading to his wrongful termination from a radio station. The judge ultimately decided that Swift wasn\u2019t legally responsible for Mueller losing his job, but the jury could still find her mom Andrea and radio liaison Frank Bell liable.\n\nThe trial continued Monday to address those remaining claims, as well as the singer\u2019s countersuit against Mueller for assault and battery. As Gossip Cop noted, Swift countersued for just one dollar as her lawsuit was filed to raise awareness about sexual assault, as opposed to financial gain. Swift reportedly broke down into tears as lawyers on both sides presented their closing arguments earlier today, the sixth day of the trial.\n\nMueller\u2019s attorney, Gabriel McFarland, reportedly held up the photo of Swift and his client during his closing statements and asked the jury if the smiling singer looked like she\u2019d just been assaulted. Swift\u2019s lawyer, Douglas Baldridge, shot back during his closing argument that there\u2019s no logical reason his client would make up a story about Mueller grabbing her butt. Baldridge stated, \u201c[Mueller] can\u2019t take responsibility for what he is doing,\u201d before calling the former DJ\u2019s lawsuit \u201cshameful and cowardly.\u201d\n\nFollowing the closing statements, the eight-person jury consisting of two men and six women exited the court and began to deliberate for four hours. In the end, they unanimously determined Mueller groped Swift and awarded her the $1. In addition, the jurors found that Swift\u2019s mom and Bell both did not do anything improper to interfere with Mueller\u2019s employment. It was a complete victory for Swift\u2019s camp, and a total loss for Mueller.", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/f79fc341-a979-4863-81b0-eea1ddc6e07b?ops=resize(900,506),quality(10)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59306737b1df88f3225ffd1e?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/67f94daa86d910d13a1eb7e2?ops=gravity(%22center%22),contain(154,80)&quality=80", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/62449366f83409bfcc81dbde?ops=gravity(%22center%22),contain(128,44)&quality=80", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59306737b1df88f3225ffd1e?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-08-14-taylor-swift-wins-countersuit-against-dj-david-mueller-in-groping-trial/", "title": "Taylor Swift Wins Countersuit Against DJ David Mueller In Groping Trial", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_us", "title": "Taylor Swift Wins Countersuit Against DJ David Mueller In Groping Trial | The Bobby Bones Show", "description": "Taylor Swift\u2019s groping trial officially ended Monday after she won her countersuit against former DJ David Mueller", "url": "https://bobbybones.iheart.com/content/2017-08-14-taylor-swift-wins-countersuit-against-dj-david-mueller-in-groping-trial/", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59306737b1df88f3225ffd1e?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "site_name": "The Bobby Bones Show", "type": "article"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#fff", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "theme-color": "#c71f2b", "twitter": {"title": "Taylor Swift Wins Countersuit Against DJ David Mueller In Groping Trial | The Bobby Bones Show", "description": "Taylor Swift\u2019s groping trial officially ended Monday after she won her countersuit against former DJ David Mueller", "url": "https://bobbybones.iheart.com/content/2017-08-14-taylor-swift-wins-countersuit-against-dj-david-mueller-in-groping-trial/", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59306737b1df88f3225ffd1e?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bobbybonesshow", "creator": "@bobbybonesshow", "domain": "bobbybones.iheart.com", "tile": {"image": {"alt": "Taylor Swift\u2019s groping trial officially ended Monday after she won her countersuit against former DJ David Mueller"}, "template": {"testing": 1}}, "": {"tile": {"image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59306737b1df88f3225ffd1e?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)"}}}, "description": "Taylor Swift\u2019s groping trial officially ended Monday after she won her countersuit against former DJ David Mueller", "keywords": "Taylor Swift (33221)", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59306737b1df88f3225ffd1e?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/59306737b1df88f3225ffd1e?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "application-name": "The Bobby Bones Show", "fb": {"app_id": 313936132010795, "pages": 121644831183563}, "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502683200.0, "source": "http://bobbybones.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
