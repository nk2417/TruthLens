Maybe you should\u2019ve said no deal to that fugly hat, nahmean?\"\"\n\nAnd so forth.\n\nAnyway, it all sounds very far-fetched, but this isn\u2019t the first report we\u2019ve heard that Kate and Meg aren\u2019t exactly beasties:\n\n\"Kate feels like Meghan has barely made any effort with her and is more interested in impressing [Queen Elizabeth],\u201d a source recently told some tabloid called Closer Weekly.\n\n\"Kate feels left out. She spent years working on her image as \u2018the perfect royal,\u2019 and Meghan is stealing her thunder,\"\n\nYes, a real feud might be taking place among the duchesses.\n\nIf only we could convince them to star in a reality show about their classy beef.", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/2552_D085_00216R-H-2025-80x80.webp", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/meghan-markle-and-kate-middleton-together-743x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1154615733-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2159895990-6-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/the-new-duchess-683x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247300883-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/julie-chen-waves-big-brother-flag-320x240.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_annaduggar_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1119_janellebrown_angelamoody_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/69023040a27d084abe99b818-80x80.webp", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/markle-and-middleton-720x540.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1119_tekashi6ix9ine_header-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/markle-and-middleton-683x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/markle-and-middleton-scaled.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/markle-and-middleton-scaled.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/06/kate-middleton-trash-talks-meghan-markle-daily-report/", "title": "Kate Middleton Trash-Talks Meghan Markle Daily (Report)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kate Middleton Trash-Talks Meghan Markle Daily (Report)", "description": "Ever since Meghan Markle married Prince Harry, there have been rumors about the former actress\u00a0struggling to fit in with the royals.
