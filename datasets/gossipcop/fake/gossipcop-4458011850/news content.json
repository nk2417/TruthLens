Movers were seen at her Toronto apartment, and now People is reporting that Markle is in the process of moving in with Prince Harry at Kensington Palace. \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of if she\u2019s moving in, it\u2019s just a matter of when,\" a source told the outlet.\n\n\u201cHarry has made no secret of the fact that he wants to marry her. She is the one.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Us Weekly is going one step further and reporting that yes, the two are totally engaged now, planning a summer wedding (it'll happen by late June), and that Markle is indeed moving in with Harry ASAP. \u201cThere are are no plans for them to live separately,\u201d a friend of Markle\u2019s told the outlet. \u201cMeghan will move right in.\u201d\n\nTheir official engagement announcement, Us claims via an insider, \u201cwill likely be some time in January. It gives Meghan some to get settled and will be a great start to 2018.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarkle and Prince Harry will live together in his two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage on the Kensington Palace grounds. Prince William and Kate Middleton also lived together in a North Wales farmhouse before they got married.", "images": ["http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/close.38e3324.svg",
