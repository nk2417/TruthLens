Why would I? I don't.\"\n\nKarwai Tang // Getty Images\n\nThe couple will be entering into married life with a lot of big films on the horizon, with Michael Fassbender currently starring in the adaptation of Jo Nesb\u00f8's bestselling thriller The Snowman and also due to reprise his role as Magneto in next year's X-Men: Dark Phoenix.\n\nAlicia, meanwhile, is gearing up for the release of the Tomb Raider reboot, in which she takes over the role of Lara Croft from Angelina Jolie.\n\nTomb Raider will crash into UK and US cinemas on Friday, March 16, 2018, and you can watch the first trailer for the film right here:\n\nWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?
