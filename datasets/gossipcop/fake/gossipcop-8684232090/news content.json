In fact, saying that he\u2019s sorry for his past has been one of the premiere promotional tools for his highly-anticipated follow-up to 2013 compilation Journals.\n\nEven before he kicked off his notorious string of bad behavior in 2013 and 2014, however, Bieber has been offering mea culpas to fans for his actions, whether intentionally or accidentally terrible. Here are 22 of the 22-year-old\u2019s best apologies.\n\n1. Apology for ignoring British fans (2010)\n\n\u201cWish I could have come out from the performance at the Mayfair but security wouldn\u2019t let me. For those girls who cursed me out for it, I\u2019m sorry, but sometimes I need to listen to security so no one gets hurt. But I like your attitude. The UK goes hard.\u201d\n\n2. Apology for ignoring Brazilian fans (2011)\n\n\u201cLove when the press think I\u2019m annoyed because I look tired. I\u2019m just tired. It\u2019s normal. I\u2019m not a machine. I\u2019m in Brazil!! Not annoyed. I\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\n3. Apology for ignoring French fans (2012)\n\n\u201cThe other day in the airport I got surrounded by 20 paps. I don\u2019t like small spaces, and I just wanted to get on the plane. I ran to get through the gate and there is a video of me running by fans and on the other side you don\u2019t see the 20 paps. I would never run by my fans. For those that I did pass that day I AM SORRY. I know my fans are my everything. I know my responsibility to love them. I LOVE MY BELIEBERS.\u201d\n\n4. Apology for flipping off paparazzi (2011)\n\n\u201cHad a great bday and at the end of the night [Selena and I] got surrounded by paps and I reacted in a way I know better. I\u2019m sorry. #killthemwithkindness. It\u2019s not always easy but I know better than to react in anger.\u201d\n\n5. Apology for throwing up onstage (2012)\n\n\u201cI know that you guys don\u2019t judge me, do you? You love me just the same, even though I\u2019m throwing up all over the stage. You love me that much?\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\n6. Apology to Bill Clinton after cussing him out on video (2013)\n\n\u201cThanks for taking the time to talk, Mr. President. Your words meant a lot. #greatguy\u201d\n\n7. Apology for canceled show (2015)\n\n\u201cI look forward to the opportunity to give my UK beliebers a great show in the near future and hope to honor my commitment to [the Prince\u2019s] Trust at that time.\u201d\n\n8. Apology for canceled TV appearance (2010)\n\n\u201cJust want to let my people in Germany know I won\u2019t be on Wetten Dass tonight as an accident has taken place and we all don\u2019t think it is right to continue \u2026 I\u2019m sorry we couldn\u2019t perform tonight but some things are more important than putting on a show.\u201d\n\n9. Apology for smoking weed (2013)\n\n\u201cI also heard he got busted for smoking weed,\u201d Bieber said in a Saturday Night Live sketch in reference to himself. \u201cAnd he\u2019s really sorry about it. And people make mistakes. And he\u2019s never gonna do it again.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-215991-GettyImages-494723598.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-215991-GettyImages-494723598.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brittany Spanos", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/all-apologies-22-times-justin-bieber-said-sorry-41634/", "title": "All Apologies: 22 Times Justin Bieber Said \u2018Sorry\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "From ignoring fans to throwing up on stage, Justin Bieber has had many reasons to atone.
