That's when former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer rolled in to assist him with a report on the crowd.\n\nThe surprise guest arrived behind a podium like the one in the White House press briefing room. \"This will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period. Both in person and around the world,\" he declared with firm conviction.\n\nHe was making fun of his own unwavering assertion about the viewership of Trump's January inauguration. At the sight of him, several celebrities \u2014 most notably Melissa McCarthy, who famously played Spicer on Saturday Night Live \u2014 had strong reactions.\n\nAnna Chumskly of Veep had the most meme-worthy natural reaction. Consider it whenever you need to communicate a combination of awe and disbelief.\n\nPerhaps knowing that all eyes would be on her, Melissa McCarthy, who won an Emmy for her SNL impression of Spicer, kept it cool.\n\nMy new favourite reaction by Melissa McCarthy to Sean Spicer coming out on stage on a podium like the one she made famous on SNL.
