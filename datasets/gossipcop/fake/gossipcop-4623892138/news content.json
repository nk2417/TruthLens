A lawsuit has been filed against Hollywood producer Joel Silver for the drowning of his assistant, Carmel Musgrove, who was found dead while celebrating Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux\u2019s honeymoon in 2015.\n\nAccording to the papers obtained by The Hollywood Reporter, Silver\u2019s company, Silver Pictures, flew the 28-year-old out to the Four Seasons Hotel in Bora Bora along with others on a chartered Gulfstream to celebrate the marriage of Aniston and Theroux.\n\nOn August 18, 2015, Musgrove reportedly went on a fishing trip and then had dinner with Silver\u2019s family, where alcohol was supplied.\n\nRelated: Happily Wedded Bliss!

Check out which celebrities have made the trek down the aisle since January, including Mary-Kate Olsen, Sofia Vergara, Jennifer Aniston, Jason Aldean, Cameron Diaz, and more.\n\nThe lawsuit \u2014 which was filed on Friday, August 18, in L.A. County Superior Court \u2014 claims that after dinner, Musgrove went to the bungalow of Silver\u2019s personal chef, Martin Herold, and indulged in cocaine and marijuana before retreating back to her room around 11 p.m. She reportedly sent a message to Herold that said \u201cXxx\u201d around midnight and asked hotel staff for matches. The staff member who supplied the matches was allegedly the last person to see her alive.\n\nAfter more than a day of searching, her nude body was found floating in a lagoon just 500 yards away from her bungalow.\n\nThe suit questions how an email managed to be sent from her account at 7:04 a.m., if she had died during a midnight swim. It also states that Musgrove\u2019s death was due in part to alcohol, cocaine, work fatigue, heat stroke and swimming in choppy waters.\n\nAfter Musgrove\u2019s death, Silver\u2019s publicist released a statement that said, \u201cJoel Silver, his family and his staff are devastated by the passing of Carmel Musgrove. Carmel was a dear friend and respected colleague with a very bright future ahead of her. They will all miss her dearly.\u201d\n\nThe honeymoon festivities, which were attended by Courteney Cox, Chelsea Handler and Jason Bateman, occurred just one day after Aniston and Theroux tied the knot at their Bel Air mansion. Us Weekly exclusively reported the surprise August 2015 wedding, where other guests included Lisa Kudrow, Howard Stern and Ellen DeGeneres.\n\nRelated: Secret Celebrity Weddings From Ryan Reynolds surprise \"I do\" to Blake Lively to Beyonce's hush-hush ceremony to Jay Z, take a look back in photos at stars who married in secret\n\nSIlver\u2019s company, Silver Pictures, and Herold are also being sued over Musgrove\u2019s death. Silver produced The Matrix, V for Vendetta, and Lethal Weapon, among many other movies.", "images":
