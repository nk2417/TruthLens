A post shared by Beyonc\u00e9 (@beyonce) on Jul 13, 2017 at 10:10pm PDT\n\nAlthough it\u2019s been rumoured previously that Kim and Beyonc\u00e9 aren\u2019t the best of pals, perhaps that\u2019s all rubbish and Kim actually provided Bey with the recommendation.\n\nThe \u2018divide\u2019 between the pair is said to date back to when the Carters reportedly didn\u2019t attend Kimye\u2019s wedding and although Kim is thought to have tried to arrange playdates for Blue Ivy and North, it just hasn\u2019t happened\u2026\n\nMaybe the shared doctor is just a complete coincidence but interesting nonetheless!\n\nMain image via Instagram: Beyonc\u00e9", "images": ["https://her.ie/uploads/2025/04/colin-farrell.png?height=225&width=450&cropped",
