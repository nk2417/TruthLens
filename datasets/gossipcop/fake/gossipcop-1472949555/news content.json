But while Aniston may have played a similar role in the breakup of Justin Theroux and his girlfriend of 14 years, Aniston specifically requested a meeting to clear the air with her boyfriend\u2019s ex, reports say.\n\nAccording to Grazia magazine, Aniston had a \u201ctearful\u201d meeting with Theroux\u2019s ex, stylist Heidi Bivens, at the Mercer Hotel last week. The two had a glass of wine as they spoke, sources say. Theroux was nowhere in sight.\n\n\u201cJen has always been sympathetic to Heidi because she\u2019s heard from Justin just how devastated she is about their break-up,\u201d a source told the magazine. \u201cJen told Heidi that she understands what a painful time she has been going through and explained that she wanted her to know, hand on heart, that she would never steal another woman\u2019s man.\u201d\n\nAniston and Theroux met while filming \u201cWanderlust\u201d in Georgia last fall, a comedy about a couple how moves to a rural commune when they find themselves unemployed. The two became close on set, but Theroux was still with Bivens at the time. Aniston and Theroux weren\u2019t seen together again until March, when they both attended a dinner at the Chateau Marmont with friends.\n\nJENNIFER ANISTON NOT PREGNANT, EXPECTING\n\nJUSTIN AND JENNIFER\u2019S LINGERIE SPREE\n\nThe couple wasn\u2019t romatically linked until late May, and when the two were photographed together for the first time in early June, Bivens\u2019 mother denied that her daughter and Theroux had split. But a week later, Bivens\u2019 rep confirmed to Page Six that the couple had broken up. \u201cShe just moved out of their home last weekend,\u201d the rep said. \u201cShe has no comment.\u201d Sources said Bivens was \u201cheartbroken\u201d and \u201cblindsided.\u201d\n\nAccording to Grazia, Aniston wanted to make it clear to Bivens that her relationship with Theroux started no earlier than May and that she is not a \u201chomewrecker.\u201d\n\n\u201cJen has always been adamant that their relationships did not cross over,\u201d a source tells the magazine. \u201cHeidi apparently got quite tearful during the meeting, as it was understandably a lot of take in.\u201d\n\nBivens has been called a \u201csuper-stylist\u201d by Web site Refinery 29. She has styled videos for Kanye West, The White Stripes and Charlotte Gainsbourg and has worked for Details and Vogue.\n\nAniston\u2019s relationship with Theroux has progressed quickly since the summer. But Aniston recently cleared up rumors that she\u2019d have big news soon. \u201cRumor number one: I am not planning to get married any time soon. I\u2019ve been married once, and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll get married again. But I can tell you that as of this very moment, I have no plan to get married. Got that?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd rumor number two: no, we\u2019re not pregnant.\u201d", "images": ["https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F100-live-115674573.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2013/08/69304pcn_aniston163940-300x450.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=300", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115727300.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115485559.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fjones-road-black-friday-sale.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1763551750&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/stranger-things-ted-wheeler-weighs-115738559.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fbethenny-frankels-gift-picks-include-115619188.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115742458.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115672489.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/fergie.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/stranger-things-ted-wheeler-weighs-115738559.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115723827.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115727621.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115733621.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115733804.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/minka-kelly-jenna-bush-hager.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115723827.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115742458.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115731438.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2FKrisJennersaystheseamazingPDRNproductshavebecomehernewessentials.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115734076.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115734076.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2013/08/69304pcn_aniston163940-300x450.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=300", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2011/11/15/jennifer-anistons-tearful-meeting-with-justin-therouxs-ex/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston\u2019s \u2018tearful\u2019 meeting with Justin Theroux\u2019s ex", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
