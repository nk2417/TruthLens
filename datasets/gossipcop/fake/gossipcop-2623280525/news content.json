Such a fan of the fast food restaurant is the new mom that a McDonald\u2019s hash brown is the first thing the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star ate after giving birth to daughter True in April.\n\nKardashian, 33, looked content as she snacked away in the passenger seat, while Thompson, 27, took the wheel.\n\nWhile she and Thompson have yet to publicly address the allegations that he cheated on her throughout her pregnancy, a source tells PEOPLE that the new parents are working through the scandal.\n\nClint Brewer/Splash\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9 and Tristan seem to be in the best place they\u2019ve been since the scandal,\u201d the source says.\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9\u2019s super family-focused and wants to keep her family together. The focus is on their newborn daughter,\u201d the source shares, adding, \u201cTristan\u2019s been supportive and helping out when he can. No one was anticipating he was going to come out with her and that they would be so public last night.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Feels \u2018So Loved\u2019 on Mother\u2019s Day After Source Says Family Hasn\u2019t Visited in \u2018Weeks\u2019\n\nKardashian\u2019s decision to reconcile with Thompson did not go over well with her famous family, according to several sources.\n\nSplash News\n\nWatch the full special Born Kardashian streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9 doesn\u2019t seem too concerned how they feel about Tristan,\u201d one family source said. \u201cShe still thinks she\u2019s making the best choice for her and True. She doesn\u2019t need her family\u2019s approval and will keep doing her thing.\u201d\n\nOver Father\u2019s Day weekend, Kardashian and True received an incredibly warm welcome \u2014 complete with balloons and cookies with the newborn\u2019s face on them \u2014 after returning to Calabasas following two months of speculation about when the mother-daughter duo would travel back to California.",
