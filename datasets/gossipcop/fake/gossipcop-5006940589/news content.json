This isn\u2019t a guns situation.\u201d\n\nIt was unclear what led Trump to say the shooting was a result of \u201cmental health.\u201d Officials are still investigating the motive behind the shooter\u2019s outburst.\n\nThe president said it was too soon to rehash the gun control debate, though, echoing a common refrain from Republican officials after recent mass casualty shootings.\n\nThe White House similarly dismissed calls for fast action in response to the lethal Las Vegas shooting last month that claimed the lives of more than 50 and left more than 500 injured. \u201cI think that we can have those policy conversations, but today is not that day,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the day after the shooting during a White House news briefing.", "images": ["https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/630/quality/90/format/webp?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fa8%2Fd7%2F895ef0544e19bd67faedb18a3d4b%2F171106-kellyanne-conway.jpg", "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/630/quality/90/format/webp?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F04%2F48%2F3959e96b4fe9819cc712f4cd826d%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2169804185", "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fa8%2Fd7%2F895ef0544e19bd67faedb18a3d4b%2F171106-kellyanne-conway.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fa8%2Fd7%2F895ef0544e19bd67faedb18a3d4b%2F171106-kellyanne-conway.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/06/kellyanne-conway-texas-shooting-democrats-disrespectful-244595", "title": "Conway: Politicizing Texas shooting 'disrespectful to the dead'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "brightspot.contentId": "0000015f-91aa-d061-a7df-d1aa84330000", "description": "Conway lamented Sunday's lethal shooting, which left at least 26 dead after a gunman opened fire on the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday.", "og": {"description": "Conway lamented Sunday's lethal shooting, which left at least 26 dead after a gunman opened fire on the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday.", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "image": "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fa8%2Fd7%2F895ef0544e19bd67faedb18a3d4b%2F171106-kellyanne-conway.jpg", "site_name": "POLITICO", "title": "Conway: Politicizing Texas shooting 'disrespectful to the dead'", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2017/11/06/kellyanne-conway-texas-shooting-democrats-disrespectful-244595"}, "title": "Conway: Politicizing Texas shooting 'disrespectful to the dead' - POLITICO", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@politico", "description": "Conway lamented Sunday's lethal shooting, which left at least 26 dead after a gunman opened fire on the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday.", "image": "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fa8%2Fd7%2F895ef0544e19bd67faedb18a3d4b%2F171106-kellyanne-conway.jpg", "site": "@politico", "title": "Conway: Politicizing Texas shooting 'disrespectful to the dead'"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509944400.0, "source": "http://www.politico.com", "summary": ""}
