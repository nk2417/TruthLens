Cotillard, who is expecting a baby with partner Guillaume Canet (who also directed Rock\u2019n Roll), utilized Instagram\u2019s new photo gallery feature so as not to flood fans\u2019 feeds.\n\nThe successive posts tie Rihanna\u2019s record of 18 selfies in a 24-hour period, which the singer had posted in celebration of the Crop Over festival in her native Barbados in 2015.\n\nA post shared by @marioncotillard on Mar 6, 2017 at 3:10pm PST\n\nA post shared by @marioncotillard on Mar 6, 2017 at 3:11pm PST\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter has reached out to Cotillard\u2019s reps for comment.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/marionsplitself.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/marionsplitself.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Reed", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/marion-cotillard-gets-lip-injections-movie-role-983945/", "title": "Marion Cotillard Shows Off \u2018Rock\u2019n Roll\u2019 Movie Makeover With 18 Selfies", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "If you've got it, flaunt it.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Sam Reed", "tags": "Style News", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Marion Cotillard Shows Off \u2018Rock\u2019n Roll\u2019 Movie Makeover With 18 Selfies", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/marion-cotillard-gets-lip-injections-movie-role-983945/", "description": "If you've got it, flaunt it.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/marionsplitself.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Marion Cotillard Gets Lip Injections for Movie Role"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-03-07T11:06:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-29T07:29:18+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "If you've got it, flaunt it.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Marion Cotillard Shows Off \u2018Rock\u2019n Roll\u2019 Movie Makeover With 18 Selfies", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/marionsplitself.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488884799.0, "source": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
