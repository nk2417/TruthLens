The thing we all have in common is that we\u2019re all very driven, ambitious and passionate.\n\n\u201cMeghan was the recruitment chair of the sorority during her time here.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\u201cShe was in charge of bringing in new girls \u2013 you have to be a very friendly and outgoing person for that role.\n\n\u201cI lived in the house for a year and it\u2019s a very fun experience, you end up becoming friends with people you never thought you\u2019d mix with.\n\nView 7 Images Meghan was part of Kappa Kappa Gamma while studying at Northwestern University (Image: Coleman-Rayner)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\u201cAll of the late nights, and coming home from going out, watching movies\u2026 you develop very strong friendships.\u201d\n\nMeghan is not the only famous actor to have graduated from Northwestern. David Schwimmer, Warren Beatty, Stephen Colbert, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Zach Braff also learned their trade at the school.\n\nFormer pals told how Meghan had her eyes firmly set on Hollywood even back then \u2013 and would often sneak off for secret auditions for TV commercials.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nWhen Harry met Meghan: ,A timeline,\n\nBut she still found time to let her hair down in the Windy City. One former student claimed: \u201cMeghan had a fake ID during her time at university and told us about it when she visited the campus in 2014. She said she used it to drink at The Keg, which was a popular student bar for years, and she also got a job at a club in the city.\n\n\u201cYou can get two fake IDs for about $100 in Chicago \u2013 it\u2019s a little bit sketchy though and not everyone has one.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 7 Images Prince Harry was known for his drinking and boozy antics in his youth (Image: GC)\n\n\u201cShe seems like the perfect modern princess now, but she lived university life like most teenagers and was really popular on campus. Everyone talks about her going here.\u201d The Keg of Evanston later lost its liquor licence \u2013 after 36 years as a students\u2019 favourite \u2013 following a battle with city officials over underage drinking.\n\nIt is now a trendy bar and restaurant, Bangers and Lace, and new management say The Keg will not be missed.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was a sh**hole, full of underage girls drinking and crazy boys starting fights,\u201d general manager Chris Nora said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me Meghan had a fake ID.\n\nView 7 Images Meanwhile, Meghan is now an accomplished actress (Image: WireImage)\n\nDoor staff used to joke when girls finally handed over a real one, saying, \u2018It\u2019s about time!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nAlready an accepted part of the family, Meghan is in the UK this week to give Prince Harry much-needed support on the 20th anniversary of mum Diana\u2019s death . She spent the anniversary behind closed doors at Kensington Palace, sharing the difficult time with Harry and his brother William, along with William\u2019s wife Kate and Harry\u2019s nephew and niece, George, four, and Charlotte, two.\n\nOur trip to Northwestern also shed some light on the mystery surrounding Meghan\u2019s birth name, Rachel. For while the world knows her as Meghan, that is actually her middle name.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nRachel is the name given by her parents Thomas and Doria.\n\nAnd photos discovered in the KKG house on campus show one picture of the actress captioned \u201cRachel Markle\u201d \u2013 and another captioned \u201cMeghan Markle\u201d.\n\nThe find suggests it was during her college years that she switched her names.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAnd as speculation grows that the world\u2019s most eligible bachelor could be about to pop the question, Meghan Markle is the name that will soon be known in every corner of the globe.", "images": ["http://www.mirror.co.uk/assets/mirror/logos/masthead-mirror-default.svg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/trust-project.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11095699.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/SUNDAY-MIRROR-PRODUCTION-Meghan-Markle.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11095670.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/SUNDAY-MIRROR-PRODUCTION-Meghan-Markle1.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11095700.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/SUNDAY-MIRROR-PRODUCTION-Meghan-Markle.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/nav-web-static/release-v41-14493b7c888038a7d89b99cb3a7937c2b71eaebe/public/logo-reach.png", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11095790.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PAY-Prince-Harry.jpg", "https://bcsecure01-a.akamaihd.net/24/4221396001/201708/1390/4221396001_5531705164001_5531675159001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001&videoId=5531675159001", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/ipso.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11095690.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/SUNDAY-MIRROR-PRODUCTION-Meghan-Markle.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11095666.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PAY-SUNDAY-MIRROR-PRODUCTION-Meghan-Markle.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11095663.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PAY-SUNDAY-MIRROR-PRODUCTION-Meghan-Markle.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11095667.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PAY-SUNDAY-MIRROR-PRODUCTION-Meghan-Markle.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11095699.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/SUNDAY-MIRROR-PRODUCTION-Meghan-Markle.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicola Small", "Katy Forrester", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/meghan-markles-uni-pals-reveal-11101548", "title": "Meghan Markle's uni pals reveal her secret wild child past that could rival party-loving Prince Harry's", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"page_id": 6149699161, "app_id": 123792601022133, "pages": 1814357575554395}, "description": "Students at Northwestern University open up on her antics as part of a hard-partying sorority", "author": "Katy Forrester", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "Googlebot-News": "noarchive", "referrer": "unsafe-URL", "keywords": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, Kensington Palace, Northwestern University, Royal Family", "news_keywords": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, Kensington Palace, Northwestern University, Royal Family", "allowTaboolaDeepDive": "true", "vf": {"00000000-0000-4000-8000-67e599051dc3": "mirror-prod-11101548"}, "og": {"title": "Meghan Markle's secret wild partying past that could rival even Prince Harry's", "description": "Students at Northwestern University open up on her antics as part of a hard-partying sorority", "url": "http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/meghan-markles-uni-pals-reveal-11101548", "site_name": "Daily Mirror", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11095699.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/SUNDAY-MIRROR-PRODUCTION-Meghan-Markle.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-02T20:35:44Z", "modified_time": "2017-09-02T22:02:03Z", "author": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/katy-forrester/", "section": "World news", "tag": "Royal Family"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@DailyMirror", "creator": "@mirrorkaty", "title": "Meghan Markle's uni pals reveal her secret wild child past that could rival party-loving Prince Harry's - The Mirror", "description": "Students at Northwestern University open up on her antics as part of a hard-partying sorority", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11095699.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/SUNDAY-MIRROR-PRODUCTION-Meghan-Markle.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504384544.0, "source": "http://www.mirror.co.uk", "summary": ""}
