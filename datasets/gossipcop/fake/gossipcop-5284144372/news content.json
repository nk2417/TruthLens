We\u2019ve got the EXCLUSIVE details.\n\nSelena Gomez and Justin Bieber\u2018s latest go at love seemed so promising. They\u2019re both much more mature and have come so far since their days of teenage love in the past. At 25, Selena was hoping that Justin could start thinking about a serious commitment in their future \u2014 marriage \u2014 but the Biebs, 24, wasn\u2019t willing to go there yet. \u201cHe loved her very much and still does and she still has strong feelings for him. But he wasn\u2019t ready to settle down with her as soon as she wanted to and she couldn\u2019t get him to actually think about marriage in a serious nature,\u201d a source close to Justin tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nSelena underwent a life saving kidney transplant in the summer of 2017. That seemed to make her realize that Justin was worth giving another chance as by late October, she broke up with boyfriend of 10 months The Weeknd, 28, and was back in the \u201cSorry\u201d singer\u2019s arms. \u201cSelena\u2019s priorities drastically changed after her surgery and her perspective on life has shifted. She was looking to settle down sooner than Justin wanted to and she took his reluctance as the last straw to finally move on from him,\u201d our insider adds.\n\nSel has fans thinking that she still has Bieber on the brain with the release of her new song \u201cBack To You\u201d on May 10. Its her first single in 2018 and her first new music since her make up and break up with Justin. It included lyrics such as \u201cLet a couple years water down how I\u2019m feeling about you\u201d and \u201cEverybody knows we got unfinished business,\u201d which Selenators immediately assumed was about Justin. The chorus went \u201cWhat was there wasn\u2019t sure. But I\u2019d go back to you. I know I\u2019d go back to you.\u201d Well, she won\u2019t go back Justin unless he\u2019s ready to think about putting a ring on it!\n\nSOURCE: Hollywood life.", "images": ["https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/spl383107_002.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIyMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iODciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAyMDAgODciPjxyZWN0IHdpZHRoPSIxMDAlIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEwMCUiIHN0eWxlPSJmaWxsOiNjZmQ0ZGI7ZmlsbC1vcGFjaXR5OiAwLjE7Ii8+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI3ODgiIGhlaWdodD0iNjA3IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNzg4IDYwNyI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgc3R5bGU9ImZpbGw6I2NmZDRkYjtmaWxsLW9wYWNpdHk6IDAuMTsiLz48L3N2Zz4=", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjI2NyIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDEwMjQgMjY3Ij48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg==", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMiIgaGVpZ2h0PSIzMiIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDMyIDMyIj48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg==", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI3NzYiIGhlaWdodD0iNzc2IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNzc2IDc3NiI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgc3R5bGU9ImZpbGw6I2NmZDRkYjtmaWxsLW9wYWNpdHk6IDAuMTsiLz48L3N2Zz4=", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI3ODgiIGhlaWdodD0iMjA1IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNzg4IDIwNSI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgc3R5bGU9ImZpbGw6I2NmZDRkYjtmaWxsLW9wYWNpdHk6IDAuMTsiLz48L3N2Zz4=", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI3ODgiIGhlaWdodD0iNzg4IiB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNzg4IDc4OCI+PHJlY3Qgd2lkdGg9IjEwMCUiIGhlaWdodD0iMTAwJSIgc3R5bGU9ImZpbGw6I2NmZDRkYjtmaWxsLW9wYWNpdHk6IDAuMTsiLz48L3N2Zz4=", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIxMDI0IiBoZWlnaHQ9IjEyNyIgdmlld0JveD0iMCAwIDEwMjQgMTI3Ij48cmVjdCB3aWR0aD0iMTAwJSIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxMDAlIiBzdHlsZT0iZmlsbDojY2ZkNGRiO2ZpbGwtb3BhY2l0eTogMC4xOyIvPjwvc3ZnPg=="], "top_img": "https://bigeye.ug/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/spl383107_002.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://bigeye.ug/justin-bieber-selena-gomezs-rekindled-romance-ended-when-he-couldnt-promise-her-marriage/", "title": "Justin Bieber & Selena Gomez\u2019s Rekindled Romance Ended When \u2018He Couldn\u2019t Promise\u2019 Her Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Bieber & Selena Gomez\u2019s Rekindled Romance Ended When \u2018He Couldn\u2019t Promise\u2019 Her Marriage", "description": "Selena Gomez had to walk away from Justin Bieber when he couldn\u2019t promise her a serious future that included marriage.
