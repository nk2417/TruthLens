But in addition to spending as much time as possible with Maddox, 15; Pax, 13; Zahara, 12; Shiloh, 10; and twins Vivienne and Knox, 8, the star wants to surprise them with grand gestures as well. How cute is THAT?\n\n[jwplatform yO3OYE8x]\n\n\u201cBrad\u2019s an amazing dad, he\u2019ll be pulling out all the stops to make those kids happy,\u201d an insider revealed to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cA few people have suggested that he take Maddox and Pax to Coachella for the day. No doubt that\u2019s something that would really thrill them.\u201d Coachella, which starts Apr. 14 and goes until Apr. 23, would definitely be an amazing surprise for Brad\u2019s two sons. And let\u2019s be real, we all know how hard it is to bond with teenagers, but with a Coachella trip, Brad\u2019s job may get a whole lot easier!\n\nAside from bonding though, Brad seems to want to TAKE his kids somewhere special. After all, Angie has been jet-setting with them since she filed for divorce in September. \u201cBrad\u2019s supportive of Angelina taking the kids overseas because that sort of travel is their normal, but he wants life to stay as consistent as possible,\u201d our source continued. \u201cBut he\u2019s looking forward to spending more time with all of them [after their trip to London.]\u201d\n\nLooks like Coachella may do the trick! But fancy trips or not, Brad clearly just loves being around his kids no matter WHAT they\u2019re doing. When the children returned from their London trip for example, the seven of them enjoyed burgers together, and reportedly had a blast!\n\n\u201cBrad\u2019s heart was full of joy to hear from his kids that they actually missed him while they were overseas,\u201d another insider told us EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cJokingly, the kids told him they also missed American food too, so Brad took them all out for cheeseburgers after they were reunited from their European trip.\u201d Aw!\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 do you think Brad will end up taking Maddox and Pax to Coachella next month?", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/brad-pitt-coachella-madox-pax-ftr.jpg?resize=384%2C216", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/brad-pitt-coachella-madox-pax-ftr.jpg?fit=600%2C651"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/brad-pitt-coachella-madox-pax-ftr.jpg?fit=600%2C651", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/03/21/brad-pitt-coachella-maddox-pax-taking-sons-surprise-trip/", "title": "Brad Pitt Spoiling Maddox & Pax With A Surprise Trip To Coachella?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Brad Pitt is determined to spoil his &amp; Angelina Jolie's 6 kids amidst their ugly divorce.
