These are just some of the most iconic celebrity feuds of all time, but none of them have anything on Matt Damon and Jimmy Kimmel. The source of their beef? Jimmy refusing to let Matt on his show and talking shit about We Bought a Zoo at every available opportunity. But to really understand the depths of Jimmy and Matt\u2019s \u201cdrama,\u201d we have to go back to a time when skinny jeans and Uggs ruled the world: 2005.\n\nCirca 2005\n\nJimmy casually ends a show with, \u201cI want to apologize to Matt Damon. We ran out of time.\u201d The joke being that Matt Damon is way too famous to ever come on his TV show. Due to lols, he starts ending pretty much every show the same way:\n\nJimmy told NPR, \u201cWe had a bad show....The guests were bad, and I was feeling pretty bad about myself at the end of the program. I decided to say, for the amusement of one of our producers who was standing next to me, \u2018I want to apologize to Matt Damon. We ran out of time.\u2019 And he got a kick out of it\u2015the producer\u2015so I just started doing it every night to amuse him. Matt Damon was just the first name that popped into my head. I was trying to think of an A-list star and somebody we absolutely would not bump if he was on the show. The legs on this bit are unbelievable to me. I mean, people laugh every time I say it. Repeating the same joke every single night, you\u2019d think eventually people would get tired of it, but they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nJanuary 2008\n\n\n\nJimmy\u2019s then-girlfriend, comedian Sarah Silverman, breaks the fake news that she\u2019s \u201cfucking Matt Damon,\u201d in song form, no less.\n\nJanuary 2009\n\n\n\nPlot twist: Jimmy reveals that he\u2019s \u201cfucking Ben Affleck.\u201d\n\n\n\nMarch 2010\n\nIn what we can all agree is a true blow, Matt gets Jimmy kicked out of the Handsome Men Club.\n\nFebruary 2012\n\nJimmy drops a trailer for the celeb-packed Movie: The Movie, and unfortunately, Matt\u2019s starring role as a bunch of grapes gets cut. Hate when that happens.\n\nJanuary 2013\n\nMatt takes matters into his own hands and holds Jimmy captive while he takes over the show:\n\nHe also gets Jimmy\u2019s parents to declare that they\u2019re replacing him with Matt:\n\nFebruary 2014\n\nMatt joins a bunch of other celebrities for Mean Tweets, only his mean tweets are from @jimmykimmel.\n\nAlso February 2014\n\nMatt\u2014along with the cast of Momentous Men\u2014is invited on Jimmy\u2019s show for an interview. Tragically, an alarm goes off right when Matt is asked a question.\n\nJanuary 2015\n\nJimmy reveals that Matt is responsible for DeflateGate. Shocking if true.\n\nJuly 2015\n\nJimmy absolutely trashes Matt\u2019s new space movie.\n\nSeptember 2015\n\nJimmy and Matt undergo couples therapy with Dr. Phil. Glad they\u2019re finally getting professional help!\n\nFebruary 2016\n\nBen Affleck sneaks Matt Damon into Jimmy Kimmel Live:\n\nJuly 2016\n\nDue to increasing animosity, Jimmy and Matt return to therapy...to no avail.\n\nAlso July 2016\n\nSad news: Jimmy is once again unable to include Matt on the show, despite him being in the greenroom. :)\n\nAugust 2016\n\nMatt releases a political attack ad against Jimmy, which, fair.\n\nSeptember 2016\n\nMatt crashes Jimmy\u2019s moment at the Emmys and trolls him over losing to John Oliver.\n\nFebruary 2017\n\nMatt sneaks onto Jimmy Kimmel Live dressed as Tom Brady.\n\nAlso February 2017\n\nJimmy defaces Matt\u2019s seat photo at the Oscars.\n\nAlso February 2017\n\n\n\nSpeaking of the Oscars, Jimmy has Matt played off stage while he\u2019s trying to present.\n\nAnd also treats everyone to a We Bought a Zoo tribute.\n\nOctober 2017\n\nMatt, in yet another attempt to make it on Jimmy Kimmel Live, crashes Chris Hemsworth\u2019s interview:\n\nOctober 2018\n\nJimmy and Matt show up to a game in adorable matching friendship T-shirts:\n\nJerritt Clark // Getty Images\n\nMay 2019\n\nJimmy has Tom Brady throw a football through Matt\u2019s window.\n\nJune 2020\n\nMatt takes news of Jimmy\u2019s summer break...extremely badly.\n\nJanuary 2023\n\nUnfortunately, Jimmy runs out of time on his 20th anniversary show and is forced to once again bump Matt Damon. You\u2019ll make it one day, buddy!\n\nMarch 2023\n\nJimmy tells People re: Matt Damon skipping the Oscars, \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that he won\u2019t show. I hope he never gets nominated again.\u201d Jimmy also blamed Matt for 2017\u2019s EnvelopeGate, saying, \u201cI believe that his presence in some way caused the envelope mixup.\u201d\n\nMatt then flips Jimmy off at the premiere party for Air.\n\nGilbert Flores // Getty Images\n\nAnd Jimmy helpfully promotes Air on Instagram!\n\nToward the end of the month, Jimmy interviews Matt Damon, but unfortunately, the screen just happens to have a breakdown, prompting Jimmy to say, \u201cYou know, I think you might have accidentally turned on a filter with one of your big fat fingers.\u201d\n\nAaaand that brings us up to date. What a beautiful relationship!!!!", "images": ["http://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon",
