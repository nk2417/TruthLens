The concern was especially palpable since Bieber and Gomez had been together as recently as a few months ago, only reportedly breaking up in March.\n\nHowever, as much as the tabloid-consuming public loves a love triangle and salivates over the idea of a woman scorned, I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say that if there\u2019s anyone we should be worried about right now, it would not be Selena Gomez. Beliebers may not be fine\u2014whether because they wanted to marry Bieber themselves or because they longed for Bieber and Gomez to end up together at last\u2014but something tells me Selena Gomez is more than fine herself. And not just because she stepped out looking perfectly happy in new hair extensions this week or because a source bluntly told Us Weekly: \u201cSelena doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nFor one, Gomez was always the more mature, has-her-shit-together member of the relationship. She was never the one getting arrested for a DUI in a rented Lamborghini in Miami. She has never urinated in a restaurant mop bucket. She has, especially by child Disney star\u2013turned\u2013teen pop idol standards, largely skirted controversy and scandal. And perhaps she is not the spontaneous, splashy engagement type either, which may be why she is no longer with someone who clearly is. All good thoughts to Bieber and Baldwin, but statistically speaking, drawing on the history of young celebrity engagements, Gomez is probably not the person we should be concerned about here.\n\nFurthermore, for Selena Gomez, marrying Justin Bieber could very possibly feel akin to marrying your high school boyfriend at age 25, which a lot of people, in 2018, simply do not want to do. The long\u2014so long\u2014history of their relationship was absolutely part of what made people root for them, but it could always be a valid deal-breaker. \u201cIt was never a healthy situation for Selena and Justin,\u201d a source tells People. A \u201cBieber pal\u201d echoed to the magazine: \u201cTheir relationship was always very complex and complicated. It was just too much baggage.\u201d", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68fe895504eb440b791dae84/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6902341b8d2485587b8de59f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58584b45a6984b8c49fabbb0/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6907746f1dd6ad7f04518d0a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6906bd8c2c0bbff3401f91b9/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/69022417bcffe9126391ad61/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6904ae58771ad895ba434241/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/69095f6ef26d05febe0b92f9/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68fdf8322ce499027c6c2a74/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/us/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b46163940e04a767cc294ca/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-selena-gomez-fine.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/690336b6f67d4cd78e99e5c4/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68f7be439c0df95a303490b3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b46162fca34920c328ecb31/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/00-story-selena-gomez-fine.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68fe02ba119b6c5d0309174e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6904860c38077846c2240e7a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5b46163940e04a767cc294ca/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-selena-gomez-fine.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michelle Ruiz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/selena-gomez-doesnt-care-about-justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-engagement", "title": "Selena Gomez Isn\u2019t Worried About Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin\u2019s Engagement, So Don\u2019t Worry About Her", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Michelle Ruiz", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "In light of Justin Bieber\u2019s engagement to Hailey Baldwin, questions have been raised about Gomez\u2019s state of mind.
