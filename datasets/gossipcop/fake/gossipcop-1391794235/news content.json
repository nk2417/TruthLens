His parents are William Alvin Pitt, 83, and the proprietor of a trucking company, and Jane Etta, 84, formerly a school counselor. His acting career began in 1987, though only with uncredited roles, and his breakthrough role is considered to be in Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning Thelma & Louise in 1991, starring Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon.\n\nBrad Pitt's net worth\n\nAfter over 30 years in the industry \u2013 he has also landed endorsement deals with luxury brands such as Cadillac, Chanel, Heineken, and Tag Heuer, and once owned a vineyard, Miraval, in France \u2013 his net worth sits at a whopping $400 million. The astounding number is about double of what some of his famous exes Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston, and Angelina Jolie's net worths are.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow\n\nGwyneth has been one of Hollywood's favorite It Girls, and nepo babies, since the 1990s. Her and Brad were together from 1994 to 1997, when they called off their engagement, though they remain friends, with the actress recently supporting his latest business venture, a cashmere brand.\n\n\n\nWATCH: Gwyneth Paltrow reveals incredible Brad Pitt story\n\n\u00a9 Getty Gwyneth and Brad at the 68th Annual Academy Awards in 1996\n\nWhile the Goop founder has starred in hit movies such as Iron Man, The Royal Tenenbaums, A Perfect Murder, The Talented Mr. Ripley, and even won an Oscar for Shakespeare in Love, it's her company Goop that really sky-rocketed her wealth. She has a reported net worth of $200 million, and her wellness company is valued at $250 million.\n\nJennifer Aniston\n\nAfter splitting from Gwyneth, Brad next dated Jennifer. They first met in 1994, though they didn't start dating until 1998. They got married in 2000, though by 2005, they called it quits, and had a highly-publicized divorce.\n\n\u00a9 Getty Brad and Jennifer had an instantly viral reunion at the 2020 SAG Awards\n\nJennifer of course has fame and fortune from her ten-year tenure on Friends, plus countless hit movies and now, her haircare brand Lolavie. She has an estimated net worth of $320 million, and her box office gross is over $1.6 billion worldwide.\n\nAngelina Jolie\n\nLast but certainly not least is Angelina, the famous third point of the notorious love triangle between her, Brad and Jennifer.\n\n\u00a9 Getty \"Brangelina\" on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith in 2004\n\nThe former couple first met while filming Mr. and Mrs. Smith in 2003. By 2005, some months after Jennifer filed for divorce from Brad, he went with the Maleficent actress to Ethiopia to adopt Angelina's daughter Zahara, whose last name was formally changed to Jolie-Pitt in 2006.
