'F*** 'em!' and 'Robbed!' I got.\n\n\"I found it quite endearing and flattering that I had so many people rooting for me. It was almost just as good to be number one snubbed than to be nominated. Now I don't have any pressure.\"\n\nJulianne Moore, Reese Witherspoon, Marion Cotillard, Felicity Jones and Rosamund Pike are the nominees for Best Actress at this year's Academy Awards and Aniston has received messages of support from a couple of them, \"[Reese] sent me such a sweet email, as did Julianne. They are all amazing women, but you know, we're all rooting for each other and it doesn't take away the work that was done. So it's really, really nice.\"\n\nThe former Friends star added that she was keen to take on the role of a woman suffering with chronic pain in Cake to test herself as an actress, \"I needed to do it so I could prove to myself that I was able to do it. So I wasn't sitting there frustrated that I wasn't getting certain parts because they knew something I didn't know - which was that I couldn't do it\u2026 It's something I hadn't done before - to take on such a wonderfully layered, complex character.''", "images": ["https://www.rte.ie/images/000a04a8-1600.jpg", "https://www.rte.ie/images/000a04a8-500.jpg", "https://www.rte.ie/djstatic/dotie/img/rte-svg-icons/Close.svg?v=202511144v1", "https://www.rte.ie/djstatic/dotie/img/rte-svg-icons/Forward-fill.svg?v=202511144v1", "https://www.rte.ie/djstatic/dotie/img/rte-svg-icons/MagnifyingGlass.svg?v=202511144v1", "https://www.rte.ie/djstatic/dotie/img/rte-svg-icons/Menu-Hamburger.svg?v=202511144v1", "https://www.rte.ie/djstatic/dotie/img/logo_rte.svg?v=202511144v1", "https://www.rte.ie/djstatic/dotie/img/rte-svg-icons/Person.svg?v=202511144v1", "http://www.rte.ie/static/images/advertising/ad.gif", "https://www.rte.ie/images/00094577-600.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.rte.ie/images/000a04a8-1600.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2015/0119/673692-jennifer-aniston-laughs-off-oscar-snub/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston laughs off Oscar snub", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, maximum-scale=10, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "siteCS": "master", "language": "en", "app-name": "dotie", "fb": {"admins": 100010507681175, "pages": 103898372992206, "app_id": 212765848759773}, "pillar": "entertainment", "description": "Jennifer Aniston isn't bitter about her lack of Oscar nomination for her role in Cake saying \"it's almost just as good to be number one snubbed than to be nominated.\"", "topic": "entertainment", "pillarCS": "entertainment", "DC.identifier": "urn:epic:673692", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=355836123, app-argument=rtenewsnow://article:673692", "categories": "Entertainment, Cake, Jennifer Aniston, Movies, oscars", "DC.type": "article", "DC.isPartOf": "urn:epic:350", "section": "Entertainment", "level2": "Entertainment", "article-type": "newsdocument", "DC.date": "2015-01-20T07:48:42+00:00", "date": "2015-01-19", "og": {"title": "Jennifer Aniston laughs off Oscar snub", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2015/0119/673692-jennifer-aniston-laughs-off-oscar-snub/", "image": "https://www.rte.ie/images/000a04a8-1600.jpg", "site_name": "RTE.ie", "description": "Jennifer Aniston isn't bitter about her lack of Oscar nomination for her role in Cake saying \"it's almost just as good to be number one snubbed than to be nominated.\"", "published_time": "2015-01-19T08:10:08+00:00"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rteentertainment/", "published_time": "2015-01-19T08:10:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-20T07:48:42+00:00", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "Entertainment, Cake, Jennifer Aniston, Movies, oscars"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@rte", "title": "Jennifer Aniston laughs off Oscar snub", "domain": "rte.ie", "creator": "@rteentertainment", "description": "Jennifer Aniston isn't bitter about her lack of Oscar nomination for her role in Cake saying \"it's almost just as good to be number one snubbed than to be nominated.\"", "image": "https://www.rte.ie/images/000a04a8-1600.jpg"}, "estagid": 33}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1421655008.0, "source": "http://www.rte.ie", "summary": ""}
