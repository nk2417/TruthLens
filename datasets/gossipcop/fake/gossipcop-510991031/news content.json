As part of his duties, Harry will launch the expedition at an event in London on Wednesday, April 11.\n\nThe palace further explained that this summer a team of six veterans from the United States and the U.K. will walk 1,000 miles from the West to the East Coast of the U.S. in 14 weeks. During that time, the expedition will also raise vital funds for veterans both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nAccording to Vanity Fair, the walk will start in Meghan\u2019s hometown of Los Angeles. And though the palace didn\u2019t announce if Harry or Meghan will be on hand, sources did confirm to Vanity Fair that the couple and their staff are already hard at work planning their first overseas trip, which may include a stop in to check on the walking troops.\n\nBut first, sources said, the newlyweds will pay a visit to Canada after saying their vows, just as William and Kate did following their 2011 wedding. And, at the time William and Kate also tacked on a quick trip to California, meaning it\u2019s very likely Harry and Meghan will do the same.\n\n\u201cCanada is on the cards. There\u2019s a lot of talk at a high-up level and among the powers that be that it will be the first country the couple visit,\u201d a source told Vanity Fair. Another added that Meghan is keen to \u201ctake Harry home once they are married on a formal tour. It\u2019s her home and she would love to go there with Harry after the wedding.\u201d\n\nOdds are Americans would be very happy to see their princess return home, too.\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.", "images": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://i.insider.com/57f55715dd0895ea358b495e?width=150&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5ac904127708e93bc362519d?width=700", "https://i.insider.com/5ac904117708e93bc362519c?width=1094&format=jpeg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5ac904117708e93bc362519c?width=1094&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Travel"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-visit-to-the-united-states-2018-4", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle could visit the United States sooner than expected", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle could visit the United States sooner than expected", "datePublished": "2018-04-07T17:45:46.000Z", "dateModified": "2018-04-07T17:49:08.000Z", "news_keywords": "News, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle", "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u00a0aren\u2019t even married yet, but that isn\u2019t stopping Kensington Palace from planning out their every move post-wedding.", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "tbi-vertical": "News", "og": {"title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle could visit the United States sooner than expected", "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u00a0aren\u2019t even married yet, but that isn\u2019t stopping Kensington Palace from planning out their every move post-wedding.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-visit-to-the-united-states-2018-4", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/5ac904117708e93bc362519c?width=1094&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1094, "height": 547}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@businessinsider"}, "robots": "noindex", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"psvp": "c"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "5ac904127708e93bc362519e", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"sections": "News", "tags": "Page Type:story"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2025-05", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
