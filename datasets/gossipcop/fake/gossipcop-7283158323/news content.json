But with Emma Stone?\u2019 they add.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the date, Justin, 46, appeared to be keeping a low-key profile with his cap pulled over his eyes while Emma, 29, seemed to be shouting something as she walked close to her companion.\n\nEmma also donned a cap pulled over her eyes and wore casual attire in an attempt to blend into the surroundings.\n\nThe date preceded the pair\u2019s recent appearance at the Met Gala, where they were pictured hanging out and later leaving the afterparty \u2013 held at Up & Down club \u2013 in a car together.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe pair became close friends on set when they filmed Netflix show Maniac and Jen is said to be wondering whether they have been dating while she and Justin were still a couple.\n\n\u2018Justin and Emma did a movie together last year, so Jen is of course now wondering whether they hooked up back then \u2013 when Justin and Jen were still married,\u2019 spills the source.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s certainly not the first time Jen\u2019s seen her husband fall for another actress on set, so of course she\u2019s wary. It happened with Brad and Angelina \u2013 so Jen can\u2019t help but think history is repeating itself,\u2019 the insider says.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Jen has been close to Emma for a while and with these recent revelations, Jen feels her pal has been disloyal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She and Emma have been friends \u2013 the fact that she\u2019s now hanging with Jen\u2019s ex-husband is a complete betrayal. Emma has obviously chosen to side with Justin after the whole split, which is very telling to Jen considering that she\u2019s been friends with Emma.\n\n\u2018She just wants to know when their hook-ups started \u2013 they looked so cosy and happy on their date, like this definitely wasn\u2019t their first night out,\u2019 the source continues.\n\n\u2018Jen just feels completely humiliated, like she\u2019s being played for a fool \u2013 and she doesn\u2019t like it one little bit.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJen and Justin called it quits in February this year and he has stayed friends with Emma since.\n\nJustin even posted the two of them hanging out onto his Instagram, but he was quick to declare they were \u2018just friends\u2019.\n\nBut just a month after announcing his split from Jen, Justin was seen at the Louis Vuitton show beside Emma.\n\nHe has also been linked to various other women including actress Aubrey Plaza and artist Petra Collins, while Emma is said to be dating writer Dave McCarthy since last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the meantime, Jen has been rumoured to be back together again with her ex-husband Brad Pitt who recently finalised his divorce from Angelina Jolie.\n\nJen is also alleged to be pregnant with Brad\u2019s child and was spotted getting off a private plane a few weeks back, hiding what seemed to be a baby bump.\n\nBut the news comes amid controversy that Brad Pitt is secretly dating beautiful architect Neri Oxman, leaving Jen to possibly consider raising their baby alone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJen and Justin have remained estranged since the split and sources tell New Idea the pair had an explosive showdown a few weeks ago as he returned to their Bel Air mansion to collect the rest of his belongings.\n\nNow with the recent release of the pictures of Justin\u2019s cosy date with Emma, the relationship with Jen is certain to become even more frosty.\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea \u2013 out now!",
