Hoda and Savannah Guthrie became the first all-female co-anchor team in the 65-year history of the Today show.\n\nBut while enthusiasm for Kotb\u2019s promotion resulted in public congratulations from her colleagues and media industry peers, rumors soared of a nasty feud taking place when the Today show cameras were turned off. The feud initially involved Hoda\u2019s co-host for the wine-sipping hour of the Today show, Kathie Lee Gifford.\n\nWhen Gifford was absent from the show, fans speculated that she was jealous of Kotb\u2019s promotion, and some thought Kathie Lee would quit. There were also reports that Hoda feels she has become \u201c too big\u201d for her gig with Gifford and is ready to quit as well, as the Inquisitr reported.\n\nMegyn Kelly Jabs At Hoda Kotb During Today Show\n\nIn addition to the alleged feud between Kotb and Kathie Lee, there are rumors of a new battle in the Today show newsroom. That rumored feud involves Hoda, her co-anchor Savannah Guthrie, and Megyn Kelly , along with the producers, an NBC News insider told Page Six .\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere is so bad around Megyn Kelly at Today that producers of the 7-to-9?a.m. slot, hosted by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, are openly sniping at her.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Lauer\u2019s exit and Hoda\u2019s promotion, Megyn follows Kotb and Guthrie in the Today show\u2019s 9 a.m. time slot. Kelly saved her congratulations for the broadcast, but Megyn\u2019s supposed congratulatory remark to Hoda was seen as a \u201cMean Girls\u201d type of jab.\n\n\u201cWe talked recently about how, 10 years ago, your life was very different,\u201d said Kelly on air to Kotb. \u201cYou were going through a dark period.\u201d\n\nStaffers assumed that Megyn was talking about Hoda\u2019s breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent surgery. But rather than explain that to viewers, Kelly probed Kotb, asking if Hoda ever took time to contemplate her life and think \u201choly moly.\u201d\n\nNBC News Staffers Shocked By Nasty On-Air Exchange\n\nWhen Megyn mentioned Hoda\u2019s \u201cdark period\u201d without explaining it to viewers, NBC News staff members in the control room were horrified, said the insider.\n\n\u201cEverybody in the control room gasped when Megyn brought up Hoda\u2019s \u2018dark period,\u2019 because many viewers likely won\u2019t know exactly what she was referring to. That comment was awkward, mean-spirited. It really stung.\u201d\n\nBecause Kotb and Guthrie have their own production team and staff while Kelly has a separate group of employees, the feud reportedly has divided the newsroom. After Megyn threw shade at Hoda, Kotb and her team fought back. As a result, the source revealed that the atmosphere for the staff as well as co-anchors has become increasingly \u201cbad.\u201d\n\nHoda Kotb & Savannah Guthrie Fight Back At Megyn Kelly\n\nIn the wake of Kelly\u2019s broadcast comment about Hoda\u2019s \u201cdark period,\u201d Kotb\u2019s and Guthrie\u2019s production team found a way to retaliate. Savannah and Hoda mocked Megyn\u2019s infamously awkward exchange with entertainment industry legend Jane Fonda. Team Kotb\u2019s producers even turned to Twitter to post a link to the jab.\n\nJane Fonda had quite the response to Lily Tomlin\u2019s facelift comment pic.twitter.com/2qUUxReqiy \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) January 16, 2018\n\nWhen Megyn interviewed Fonda, she asked about plastic surgery. Wrong question. Jane skillfully shut down Kelly by lecturing her, informing her that it was \u201cthe wrong time and place to ask that question.\u201d\n\nHoda and Savannah made it clear that they remembered and treasured Fonda\u2019s clap-back at Megyn. When Fonda showed up during Kotb\u2019s and Guthrie\u2019s Today show time slot with her buddy Lily Tomlin, Hoda asked how long their friendship had lasted.\n\n\u201cFifty years \u2014 a long time,\u201d said Jane.\n\nTomlin teased that the two had become acquainted prior to her \u201cfirst face-lift.\u201d Fonda had the perfect response.\n\n\u201c\u2018Who are you? Megyn Kelly?\u2019 joked Jane Fonda.\u201d\n\nGuthrie and Kotb couldn\u2019t stop laughing, while responses to the tweeted clip from Team Hoda showed that viewers were in on the jab at Kelly.\n\n\u201cOMG I just peed laughing at your avi!! ROFLMFAO good one!\u201d\n\nAs for what might happen next, look for Megyn Kelly to be faced with additional changes at Today , predicted Radar Online . Challenged by bad ratings, some producers reportedly want to change Kelly\u2019s time slot and move up Hoda\u2019s and Kathie Lee\u2019s hour.\n\nIn addition, with Kotb and Guthrie headed to the Olympics to broadcast the Today show live, both Gifford and Kelly are likely to be affected. Kathie Lee will be co-hosting without Hoda, while Radar Online pointed out that Megyn will remain in New York with \u201cno hour to host at all.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2421769f-57a4-4bff-913f-cf316747493e.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20157'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20492%20142'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo-white.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b080b69e05111d2a8b3b6633f72f8c45?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent-Dark-Mode.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20120%20120'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/today-hosts-hint-at-rumored-feud-hoda-kotb-savannah-guthrie-megyn-kelly-trade-mean-girl-jabs-on-air", "title": "\u2018Today\u2019 Hosts Hint At Rumored Feud: Hoda Kotb, Savannah Guthrie, Megyn Kelly Trade \u2018Mean Girl\u2019 Jabs On Air", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.png", "description": "When NBC named Hoda Kotb to replace Matt Lauer after sexual misconduct allegations caused his speedy exit, the network made history.
