His crush on the actress was revealed in 2016, a year after he apparently ensured she had a small part in The Big Short, which he produced.\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\nDespite his then-wife Angelina trying to block the move, Brad cast Margot, 28, in the memorable cameo role, which saw her give a sexy finance tutorial while in a bubble bath.\n\nAt the time, a source told Hollywood Life: \u2018Brad has had his eye on Margot for years. He jumped at the chance to squeeze her into the role she had in The Big Short so that he could spend time with her.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheir paths have crossed a few times since then, including when a very happy looking Brad stepped out of his post divorce isolation to attend a Chateau Marmont pre-Oscar party that Margot was also attending back in March.\n\nRelated: Jennifer Aniston\u2019s torment: What has Ange done?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated: Brad and Jen\u2019s big announcement: \u2018We\u2019re in love again\u2019\n\nBut now they\u2019re back together filming a thriller based on the Manson murders, Brad\u2019s admiration for the former Neighbours star has amped up again.\n\nApart from having \u2018all the qualities he loves in a girl\u2019, the set insider adds that \u2018if she wasn\u2019t married there\u2019s no doubt whatsoever he\u2019d be asking her out in a heartbeat\u2019.\n\n\u2018They get along very well, and Brad\u2019s super excited to be working with her, more than he\u2019s been in years with a leading lady,\u2019 says the source.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, film producer Tom, 28, is being warned he has reason to worry.\n\n\u2018This has to be hard for Tom, who\u2019s a trusting guy, but anyone in his position would find it tough,\u2019 the insider adds.\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea \u2013 out now!", "images": ["https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/29617/untitled-design-8.png?resize=1024%2C546", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/29538/ni-cover.jpg?resize=1024%2C614", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d683f9a7086cf5b4d843157e497fddc673a3321799da7d0d3a9507a9b5e7998e?s=128&d=mm&r=g", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/chrissie-swan-the-shortcut-queen-691e509abfe28.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-20t164344.876-691eaa9997406.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-18t103613.659-691bb21f4c9ec.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/71038/michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-hollywood.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/29617/untitled-design-8.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/Logo-1.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/131095/untitled-design-2023-11-08t103411331.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/icon-phosphor-circle.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-19t145321.000-691d3f406e345.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/07/NIFLOGO_Organge.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/gettyimages-2156373625-691bc2c3a0fcf-scaled.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/121578/untitled-design-4.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/ni2546pm1_marketing-cover_v0.1-691a9098143bf-scaled.jpg?resize=1955%2C2560", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/air-fryer-1-691eadfe53bed.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-19t134714.374-691d2fbe0f750.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/07/wordpress-featured-image-template-11-6863926196e99.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-19t162531.737-691d54db7671a.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-18t112445.554-691bbcd84c0f3.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/29617/untitled-design-8.png?resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/29617/untitled-design-8.png?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nikki Black", "Nikki Is Obsessed With All Things Celebrity", "Dreams She Is A Long-Lost Kardashian.
