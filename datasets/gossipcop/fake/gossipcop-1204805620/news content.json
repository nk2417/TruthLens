TMZ also reported that the duo grabbed dinner at the Waldorf Astoria Beverly Hills on Monday.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, Jenner and Simmons were spotted hitting up the Nice Guy in West Hollywood on Wednesday night. Though they arrived separately and exited through different doors, they left in the same SUV at the end of the night, according to video obtained by TMZ.\n\nThe Blast published a video of the couple entering the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in Beverly Hills together around 2 a.m.\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about Jenner\u2019s rumored beau.\n\nGetty (2)\n\nHe\u2019s Up for the NBA\u2019s Top Rookie Prize\n\nFollowing a successful stint playing college basketball for Louisiana State University, Simmons became the NBA\u2019s number one draft pick in 2016, signing a contract to play with the Philadelphia 76ers.\n\nAlthough Simmons ended up sitting out the 2016-2017 season after injuring his ankle during training, he made his NBA debut in October 2017. This year, the 76ers made it to the second round of the NBA finals before being knocked out by the Boston Celtics.\n\nFollowing his successful debut season, Simmons was named as one of the three finalists of the NBA\u2019s Rookie of the Year award. The winner will be announced later this month.\n\nSimmons is also signed to LeBron James\u2018 management company, Klutch Sports Group, alongside Tristan Thompson, who is currently dating and shares a child with Jenner\u2019s sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

I wanted to play against the best and be the best.\u201d\n\nHe Dated Tinashe\n\nShortly after Simmons posted a since-deleted photograph of himself with Tinashe, the \u201cAll Hands on Deck\u201d signer told Billboard in late March, \u201che\u2019s like my full boyfriend, I guess.\u201d\n\nHer last photo with Simmons was posted on April 20. \u201cThankful for you,\u201d she wrote alongside a series of the pair cuddling up together.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bh0N_uVjH2x/?taken-by=tinashenow\n\nShe previously shared photos of herself wearing his jersey and of the pair taking a ride in his Ferrari.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BhkOB8FjeRS/?taken-by=tinashenow\n\nFollowing news of Jenner\u2019s romance with Simmons, Tinashe\u2018s younger brother Kudzai accused the athlete of cheating on his sister with the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star. Kudzai also claimed that Simmons \u2014 who has deleted all photos of him and Tinashe from Instagram \u2014 and the singer only split on Sunday.\n\n\u201cSorry for blowing up y\u2019all twitter everyone,\u201d Kudzai tweeted. \u201cIt was actually the only way to defend my sister against all this bulls\u2014.\u201d\n\nThough Tinashe has not commented on the cheating rumors, her other brother Thulani also retweeted Kudzai\u2019s tweet.\n\nHe Loves His Car\n\nMuch like Jenner, the 21-year-old basketball star shows off his stylist wheels.\n\nPosing alongside his sleek black Ferrari in January, Simmons simply captioned the photo, \u201cBlessed.\u201d\n\nA love of cars is something Simmons has in common with Jenner, who told CNN in 2016 that while \u201csome people get addicted to tattoos, I\u2019m addicted to cars.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I love it, I love it. If I walk in and it really gets to me, I\u2019m like okay, I need that car,\u201d she added.\n\nThe 22-year-old-model is frequently seen out and about in her vintage 1975 Chevrolet Corvette, which she calls \u201cmy baby.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a Big Spender \u2014 on Cats\n\nOn an episode of Maverick Carter\u2019s \u201cKneading Dough\u201d series, in which professional athletes discuss their strategies for money management, Simmons revealed that he regretted spending $10,000 on two Savannah cats \u2014 a very large domesticated breed.\n\n\u201cI had two Savannah cats\u2026It was a bad purchase,\u201d he said on the episode, according to CNBC.\n\n\u201cThey were crazy,\u201d he added.\n\nBen Simmons/Instagram\n\nDetailing the experience, Simmons\u2019 half-brother Sean Tribe told The Undefeated the pair ended up saying goodbye to the felines after \u201cfour or five months.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told Ben, \u2018We can\u2019t have these cats anymore. This is crazy.\u2019\u201d Tribe remarked, after explaining how the two cats frequently scratched and clawed at the two boys. \u201cHe was going on a road trip while he was injured, and I told Ben, \u2018I am going to call the breeder and tell them we can\u2019t quite look out for the cats anymore and they can find them a better home.\u2019 He said, \u2018Cool.\u2019 \u201d", "images":
