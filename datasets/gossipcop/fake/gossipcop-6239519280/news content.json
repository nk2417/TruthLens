Mom of six Angelina Jolie revealed in a new interview with the Associated Press on Wednesday, February 17, that she never envisioned herself raising children.\n\nBut in 2000, she was shooting her blockbuster action flick Lara Croft: Tomb Raider in Cambodia, and something shifted. \u201cWhen I first came to Cambodia, it changed me,\u201d the superstar, 40, told the AP. \u201cIt changed my perspective. I realized there was so much about history that I had not been taught in school, and so much about life that I needed to understand, and I was very humbled by it.\u201d\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Angelina Jolie\u2019s Us Weekly Covers As the actress turns 38, look back at her life in headlines\n\nThe daughter of actor Jon Voight and late actress Marcheline Bertrand recalled how shooting in Cambodia was so different from L.A., where she felt \u201ca real emptiness\u201d growing up. \u201cThat trip triggered my realization of how little I knew and the beginning of my search for that knowledge,\u201d she disclosed.\n\nIt also awakened her desire to be a mom. \u201cIt\u2019s strange, I never wanted to have a baby,\u201d she reflected. \u201cI never wanted to be pregnant.

I never thought of myself as a mother.\u201d That changed when she was playing with kids at a local school in Cambodia. \u201cIt was suddenly very clear to me that my son was in the country, somewhere,\u201d she recalled.\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie: How Their Love Has Evolved Since 2005 From Mr. and Mrs. Smith to Mr. and Mrs. Pitt!
