A source told ET, meanwhile, that Younes and Jordan aren't romantically involved.\n\nInstagram\n\nKourtney, 39, and Younes, 25, started dating in 2016, but \"recently broke up after [they] decided it wasn't workout out,\" ET's source said. According to the source, Kourtney was the one to initiate the split.\n\n\"Near the end of the relationship, the two weren't getting along and the age difference ultimately played a part,\" the source added. \"Younes is young, and although mature for his age, he and Kourtney are at different stages in their lives.\"\n\nSee more on the pair in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-08/khloe_kourtney_kim_gettyimages-492410742_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-08/khloe_kourtney_kim_gettyimages-492410742_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-08/khloe_kourtney_kim_gettyimages-492410742_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-11/eto_news_daily_pete_ariana_110118.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-05/1280_kourtney_kardashian_gettyimages-954810962.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-08/khloe_kourtney_kim_gettyimages-492410742_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/kim-and-khloe-kardashian-come-for-younes-bendjima-after-kourtney-breakup-drama-107535", "title": "Kim and Khloe Kardashian Come For Younes Bendjima After Kourtney Breakup Drama", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-08/khloe_kourtney_kim_gettyimages-492410742_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "News broke of Kourtney and Younes' split on Tuesday -- and Kim and Khloe were quick to have their sister's back.", "title": "Kim & Khloe Kardashian Come For Younes Bendjima After Kourtney Breakup", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kim-and-khloe-kardashian-come-for-younes-bendjima-after-kourtney-breakup-drama-107535", "type": "Article"}, "description": "News broke of Kourtney and Younes' split on Tuesday -- and Kim and Khloe were quick to have their sister's back.", "twitter": {"description": "News broke of Kourtney and Younes' split on Tuesday -- and Kim and Khloe were quick to have their sister's back.", "title": "Kim & Khloe Kardashian Come For Younes Bendjima After Kourtney Breakup", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kim-and-khloe-kardashian-come-for-younes-bendjima-after-kourtney-breakup-drama-107535", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-08/khloe_kourtney_kim_gettyimages-492410742_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Kim and Khloe Kardashian Come For Younes Bendjima After Kourtney Breakup Drama | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Kourtney Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Younes Bendjima", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
