We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\u201d\n\nEven before publicly announcing her breakup, Aniston had been leaning on her closest girlfriends for support. The Friends star spent her 49th birthday on Feb. 11 at former costar Courteney Cox\u2019s house, a source previously told PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cShe has a huge group of girlfriends who make sure she isn\u2019t alone,\u201d an insider said at the time. \u201cJen truly has the best friends.
