The article, headlined: \u201cKim: \u2018Surprising Kanye With Triplet News Will Save Our Marriage,\u2019\u201d also indicated that their marriage was crumbling, though that too appears to be unfounded.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\nIn the piece, sources claimed that Kardashian is \u201ckeen to set the wheels in motion for her next surrogacy.\u201d Alleged insiders said that she intends to \u201ccomplete her family with triplets.\u201d They went on to frame it as a birthday gift, claiming that she is \u201cdetermined to surprise\u201d West \u201con his 41st birthday\u2026 with the news that their surrogate is ready to get pregnant again.\u201d\n\n\u201cKim\u2019s been racking her brains over what to give Kanye for his birthday, and she says that giving him more children would be the best present he could ever wish for,\u201d the source claimed. After his recent public meltdown, Kardashian reportedly believed that \u201cthe best thing for him is to focus on family, and what better way than celebrating baby news?\u201d\n\nThe source explained that the plan was for Kardashian\u2019s surrogate to \u201cbe implanted with three embryos to maximize their chances\u201d of conceiving a bigger family. They added that West \u201claughed when Kim suggested triplets, but she knows he\u2019s always wanted a big family\u2026 so she\u2019s sure he\u2019ll be ecstatic with her decision.\u201d\n\nThey even included the alleged reaction of Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian, saying the sisters \u201chave warned [Kim] that it could backfire, given that it\u2019s such a big step to take without discussing it properly with Kanye.\u201d\n\nIt turns out there\u2019s not much to back these strange claims, despite the tabloid\u2019s insistence. A report by Gossip Cop points out that Kardashian herself talked about children in March when she did an interview with Elle. The reality star specifically said she doesn\u2019t want more than four kids.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I could handle more than that. My time is spread really thin,\u201d she said at the time. In May, she talked about it again on Live with Kelly and Ryan.\n\n\u201cI would have maybe one more,\u201d she said.\n\nWhile the rumors about Kardashian seem to be false, it is true that surrogates have a high chance of gestating twins, triplets or more. According to a report on simplesurrogacy.com, several factors of the surrogacy process combined with advancements in in vitro fertilization technology make it likely for multiple embryos to mature.", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/boston-blue-faith-and-family-sonequa-martin-green-donnie-wahlberg-cbs.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "http://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/04/45511bc5-8791-4d0b-a2e9-34e9c9011b24.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/70afec6a-3143-4947-b047-428e525611d4.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Hein", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity-parents/news/rumor-kim-kardashian-wanting-triplets-kanye-west-debunked/", "title": "Rumor About Kim Kardashian Wanting Triplets With Kanye West Debunked", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Rumor About Kim Kardashian Wanting Triplets With Kanye West Debunked", "description": "Rumors that Kim Kardashian wants her surrogate to carry triplets for her have been proven false by comments she made herself.
