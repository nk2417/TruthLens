They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nNinaki says otherwise.\n\nView 7 Images (Image: Getty Images North America)\n\nView 7 Images The couple can't keep their eyes off each other (Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 7 Images Meghan aged 19 in Italy\n\n\"The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,\" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,\" she told Mail Online.\n\nPrior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\"Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There\u2019s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.\n\nView 7 Images Meghan and her mother Doria\n\nThe pair first met aged two at Hollywood\u2019s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls\u2019 high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nFollowing a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.\n\nShe explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.\n\nHow Meghan Markle became the nation's sweetheart on her very first official outing READ MORE :\n\nView 7 Images Baby Meghan with her mum (Image: Instagram)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nMeghan Markle is hailed as the new Princess Diana after first official engagement with Prince Harry READ MORE :\n\nElsewhere, Ninaki said her former best friend, who quit Suits to pursue a life with Harry, always wanted to be famous.\n\nMeghan Markle shakes hands with cheering audience\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 7 Images The happy couple (Image: PA)\n\n\"She just loved to be the centre of attention,\" she went on. \"We used to imagine her receiving an Oscar. She used to practise announcing herself.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nWhile talking about her relationship with Harry and her role as a future royal, Ninaki claims Meghan was always very aware of the Royal Family - despite the actress claiming she knew little about Harry when they met.\n\nView 7 Images Meghan paid tribte to her dad Thomas alongside this sweet picture\n\n\"I think it\u2019s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana\u2019s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.\"\n\nShe added: \"I wasn\u2019t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries \u2014 films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family. She was very taken with that idea.\"", "images": ["http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/trust-project.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11595785.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Anti-Defamation-League-Entertainment-Industry-Awards-Dinner.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11623853.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Prince-Harry-and-Meghan-Markle-visit-to-Nottingham.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11598672.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PROD-Screen-Shot-2017-11-27-at-133228JPG.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11598455.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Markle.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11603767.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PROD-Meghan-and-her-mother-Doria.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11598462.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/RLP_MDG_271117MARKLE_6866PNG.png", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/nav-web-static/release-v41-14493b7c888038a7d89b99cb3a7937c2b71eaebe/public/logo-reach.png", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11602667.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Prince-Harry-and-Meghan-Markle-engaged-London-United-Kingdom-27-Nov-2017.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11625093.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Meghan-Markle-and-Trevor-Engelson-attend-COACH-Legacy-Photo-Exhibit.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/ipso.svg", "https://bcsecure01-a.akamaihd.net/24/4221396001/201712/1891/4221396001_5664268743001_5664268877001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001&videoId=5664268877001", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/assets/mirror/logos/masthead-mirror-default.svg"], "top_img": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11625093.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Meghan-Markle-and-Trevor-Engelson-attend-COACH-Legacy-Photo-Exhibit.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zoe Shenton", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/meghan-markles-maid-honour-reveals-11625276", "title": "Meghan Markle's maid of honour reveals 'real reason' her first marriage broke up", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"page_id": 6149699161, "app_id": 123792601022133, "pages": 1814357575554395}, "description": "Ninaki Priddy gave a scathing interview where she confessed she is no longer speaking to Meghan but is still close to her ex husband", "author": "Zoe Shenton", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "Googlebot-News": "noarchive", "referrer": "unsafe-URL", "keywords": "Meghan Markle", "news_keywords": "Meghan Markle", "allowTaboolaDeepDive": "true", "vf": {"00000000-0000-4000-8000-67e599051dc3": "mirror-prod-11625276"}, "og": {"title": "Meghan Markle's maid of honour reveals real reason her first marriage broke up", "description": "Ninaki Priddy gave a scathing interview where she confessed she is no longer speaking to Meghan but is still close to her ex husband", "url": "http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/meghan-markles-maid-honour-reveals-11625276", "site_name": "Daily Mirror", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11625093.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Meghan-Markle-and-Trevor-Engelson-attend-COACH-Legacy-Photo-Exhibit.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-02T10:06:29Z", "modified_time": "2017-12-04T23:36:54Z", "author": "Zoe Shenton", "section": "Celebrity News", "tag": "Meghan Markle"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@DailyMirror", "creator": "@DailyMirror", "title": "Meghan Markle's maid of honour reveals 'real reason' her first marriage broke up - The Mirror", "description": "Ninaki Priddy gave a scathing interview where she confessed she is no longer speaking to Meghan but is still close to her ex husband", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11625093.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Meghan-Markle-and-Trevor-Engelson-attend-COACH-Legacy-Photo-Exhibit.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512209189.0, "source": "http://www.mirror.co.uk", "summary": ""}
