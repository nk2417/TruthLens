You heard that over and over \u2014 we heard that for decades. And nothing was done,\u201d the actor said.\n\nWhen asked why no one had come forward if they were aware of the alleged incident, Baldwin replied, \u201cRose McGowan took a payment of $100,000 and settled her case with him. And it was for Rose McGowan to prosecute that case.\u201d\n\nThe actor referenced a New York Times article on the subject of paying off sexual assault victims and posed the question, \u201cDo the settlement of these cases hurt the cause of exposing and bringing us to a place of real change?\u201d\n\nAdded Baldwin, \u201cWhen women take money, and are silenced by that money \u2014 even though they took the money and were silenced because they were told beyond the money it was the right thing for them to do, keep quiet, don\u2019t make too many waves, it\u2019s going to hurt your career \u2014 when they do it, nonetheless, does it set back the course of change? That\u2019s an issue, I think.\u201d\n\n.@AlecBaldwin on a culture of complicity in Hollywood after allegations of sexual harassment and assault by fmr movie mogul #HarveyWeinstein pic.twitter.com/jHeWAhEuOg \u2014 PBS NewsHour (@NewsHour) November 3, 2017\n\nOne of Weinstein\u2019s numerous accusers, Asia Argento, took to Twitter to slam Baldwin for his comments on victims who are silenced.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re either a complete moron or providing cover for your pals and saving your own rep,\u201d she wrote. In a follow-up tweet, Argento again took aim at the actor, writing, \u201cAlec Baldwin mansplaining \u2018the cause\u2019 for women everywhere.\u201d\n\nHey @AlecBaldwin you\u2019re either a complete moron or providing cover for your pals and saving your own rep. Maybe all three. https://t.co/sMERs2Y11y \u2014 Asia Argento (@AsiaArgento) November 4, 2017\n\nHours later, Baldwin clarified his interview remarks in a series of tweets, writing that he has chosen to step away from his personal account \u201cin the current climate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was never my intention, in my public statements, to \u2018blame the victim\u2019 in the many sexual assault cases that have emerged recently,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI simply posited that the settlement of such cases certainly delayed justice. \u2026 My heart goes out to all such victims. My goal is to do better in all things related to gender equality.\u201d\n\nBaldwin noted that his other Twitter account, @ABFalecbaldwin, will continue posting updates on his foundation\u2019s work with \u201cthe arts and environment.\u201d\n\n1- it is w some degree of sadness that I will suspend posting on this a TWITTER account for a period of and in the current climate. \u2014 AlecBaldwin (@AlecBaldwin) November 4, 2017\n\n2- It was never my intention, in my public statements, to \u201cblame the victim\u201d in the many sexual assault cases that have emerged recently \u2014 AlecBaldwin (@AlecBaldwin) November 4, 2017\n\n3- I simply posited that the settlement of such cases certainly delayed justice, though I am fully aware that those settlements were \u2026 \u2014 AlecBaldwin (@AlecBaldwin) November 4, 2017\n\n4- entered into w the understanding that settlement is wise, intimidated into believing so. \u2014 AlecBaldwin (@AlecBaldwin) November 4, 2017", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gettyimages-655851880_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gettyimages-655851880_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meena Jang", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/alec-baldwin-stepping-away-twitter-criticism-weinstein-payoff-comments-1055005/", "title": "Alec Baldwin Stepping Away From Twitter Following Criticism Over Weinstein Payoff Comments", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "&quot;It was never my intention, in my public statements, to 'blame the victim' in the many sexual assault cases that have emerged recently,&quot; he wrote.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Meena Jang", "tags": "Alec Baldwin, Harassment in Hollywood", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Alec Baldwin Stepping Away From Twitter Following Criticism Over Weinstein Payoff Comments", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/alec-baldwin-stepping-away-twitter-criticism-weinstein-payoff-comments-1055005/", "description": "\"It was never my intention, in my public statements, to 'blame the victim' in the many sexual assault cases that have emerged recently,\" he wrote.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gettyimages-655851880_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Alec Baldwin Stepping Away From Twitter Following Criticism Over Weinstein Payoff Comments"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-04T10:48:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-22T16:54:50+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"It was never my intention, in my public statements, to 'blame the victim' in the many sexual assault cases that have emerged recently,\" he wrote.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Alec Baldwin Stepping Away From Twitter Following Criticism Over Weinstein Payoff Comments", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gettyimages-655851880_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509792501.0, "source": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
