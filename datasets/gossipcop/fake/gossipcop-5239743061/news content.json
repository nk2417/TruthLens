Today\u2019s greatest threat is not climate change, not pollution, not flood or fire,\u201d Ford said during his acceptance speech of the Founders\u2019 Award. \u201cIt\u2019s that we\u2019ve got people in charge of important shit who don\u2019t believe in science.\u201d\n\nHe went on to criticize those politicians who let \u201cpolitical or economic self-interest denigrate or belittle sound scientific understanding of the causes and effects of human pressure on the environment.\u201d\n\nFord serves as executive vice chair of Conservation International, which celebrated its 30th anniversary at the event. The group aims to protect nature and specifically focused on a \u2018No Forests, No Future\u2019 theme at the gala, highlighting the Amazon rainforest and its importance in addressing climate change.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here tonight for one reason: I care deeply for the natural world. It\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s not about me at all, it\u2019s about this other world we\u2019re going to leave behind,\u201d the actor said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t stop the destruction of nature, nothing else will matter. Jobs won\u2019t matter, our economies won\u2019t matter, our freedoms and ethics won\u2019t matter, our children\u2019s education and potential won\u2019t matter, peace, prosperity. If we end the ability of a healthy natural world to sustain humanity nothing else will matter, simply said.\u201d\n\nFord has been deeply involved in the environmental cause for several decades, meeting with lawmakers, businesses and communities to discuss how to improve conservation policy and practices.\n\n\u201cOther than my family, doing this work has been the most important thing of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cNature doesn\u2019t need people, people need nature.\u201d\n\nMusic festival Rock in Rio and SC Johnson were also honored at the event, which drew Calista Flockhart, Sophia Bush and Arielle Kebbel, with a performance by Vanessa Carlton. Conservation International showed its virtual reality film Under the Canopy as well, giving guests a real-life look into the Amazon.\n\n\u201cIf you protect tropical forests, if you end tropical forest deforestation, it would be the equivalent of basically taking every car in the planet and making it into a Tesla overnight, that\u2019s how important it is. The epicenter of that is the Amazon,\u201d said M. Sanjayan, the group\u2019s CEO and an environmental news analyst.\n\nConservation International launched the largest tropical forest restoration project in the world this year as a result, and Ford will have continued involvement in these worldwide environmental projects.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to depend on governments alone, we\u2019ll help equip communities and businesses to lead,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a long road but I have hope.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gettyimages-854829202_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gettyimages-854829202_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kirsten Chuba", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/harrison-ford-goes-trump-administration-environmental-honor-1054597/", "title": "Harrison Ford Goes After Trump Team While Accepting Environmental Honor", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "&quot;We\u2019ve got people in charge of important shit who don\u2019t believe in science,&quot; the actor said Thursday night in Los Angeles.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Kirsten Chuba", "tags": "Events, Harrison Ford, Red Carpet", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Harrison Ford Goes After Trump Team While Accepting Environmental Honor", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/harrison-ford-goes-trump-administration-environmental-honor-1054597/", "description": "\"We\u2019ve got people in charge of important shit who don\u2019t believe in science,\" the actor said Thursday night in Los Angeles.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gettyimages-854829202_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Harrison Ford Goes After Trump Team While Accepting Environmental"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-03T11:04:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-05T14:41:09+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"We\u2019ve got people in charge of important shit who don\u2019t believe in science,\" the actor said Thursday night in Los Angeles.", "site": "@thr", "creator": "@kirstenchuba", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Harrison Ford Goes After Trump Team While Accepting Environmental Honor", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gettyimages-854829202_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509707096.0, "source": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
