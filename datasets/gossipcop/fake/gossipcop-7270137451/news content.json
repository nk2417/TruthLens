Fortunately, a 7 hour wait for the next flight to Houston won't affect me that much, but my heart sank for the elderly and parents with small children who did their best to walk all that way but had no chance of making their flights. I love witnessing people exercise their right to protest! But it saddened me to see the joy on their faces knowing that they were successful in disrupting so many people's travel plans. Yes, immigrants were affected by this as well. Brilliant. \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\n\nOn Instagram, in an effort to stand up for the immigrants and refugees affected by the ban, many commentors criticized her for what they believed wasn't seeing the bigger picture. Many also resorted to using slurs to describe the ESPN personality, which is really just a reminder that social media can be terrible all around.\n\nSteele defended herself -- and her post -- on Twitter:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sagesteele/status/825968091108564993\n\nhttps://twitter.com/sagesteele/status/825970692621377536\n\nMore NBA!\n\nLuka Donc\u030cic\u0301 stared down the Mavericks bench after draining a deep Lakers 3-pointer\n\nThe Lakers gave Anthony Davis a classy tribute in his return to Los Angeles with the Mavericks\n\nJordan Brand revs up Luka Doncic's game against Mavericks with a ruthless message", "images": ["http://ftw.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/images/smg/2025/03/06/SFTW/81752185007-90-643620.jpeg?width=660&height=359&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/images/smg/2025/03/06/SFTW/81752185007-90-643620.jpeg?crop=2056,1156,x71,y0&width=2056&height=1156&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/gciaf/prod/p?a=pageview&p=SFTW-TEALIUM-TANGENT&m=web&k=f14ebdd6-0569-4c64-af73-99937bc06379&s=noscript"], "top_img": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/images/smg/2025/03/06/SFTW/81752185007-90-643620.jpeg?crop=2056,1156,x71,y0&width=2056&height=1156&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/pop-culture/2017/01/30/sage-steele-instagram-airport-espn/81976215007/", "title": "Sage Steele slammed for Instagram post about protests at airport", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#EA2224", "og": {"title": "Sage Steele slammed for Instagram post about protests at airport", "description": "Sage Steele, like many sports figures, found herself in the middle of the\u00a0debate over Donald Trump's new immigration policy over the weekend -- and received a lot of backlash for her comments about the protests at airports.
