It's reported that the rumored couple was frolicking together in public, holding hands on a beach, and might be ready to reveal their romance.\n\nA REPORT claiming that super-secretive couple Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes were no longer an item was not true, a representative for Holmes said today.\n\nActress Katie, 39, was said to have called off their relationship after struggling with trust issues, according to reports circulating today.\n\nBut that report was shot down by her rep, in a rare acknowledgment that the pair are actually an item.\n\n\u201cThe Radar story is 100 percent untrue,\u201d Leslie Sloane, a representative for Holmes, told PEOPLE.\n\nThe couple only went public with their relationship in September last year but were first linked back in August 2013.\n\nRadar Online reported that Dawson\u2019s Creek star Katie called it quits with Jamie after reports he had been dating other women during their time together.\n\nA source is said to have told Radar Online: \u201cKatie just couldn\u2019t get over her trust issues.\u201d\n\nThe pair had insisted they were just good friends following Katie\u2019s divorce from Tom Cruise.\n\nTwo years ago, Jamie was forced to deny dating Katie when a picture emerged of the two of them holding hands in a recording studio.\n\nKatie was said to have been banned from having a public relationship under the strict terms of her quickie divorce from superstar Tom Cruise.\n\nAccording to Radar Online, Holmes agreed not to publicly date another man for five years in exchange for US$5.8 million in child support and US$6.2 million payment for herself.\n\nAn insider claimed: \u201cKatie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she\u2019s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri.\u201d\n\nShe was said to have had gone to extraordinary lengths to keep relationship with Jamie a secret.\n\nThe Sun has contacted Katie and Jamie\u2019s representatives for comment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Sun and has been republished with permission.", "images":
