You just have to respect - that's just part of our lives,\u201d he also said.\n\nBut in May 2015, Katie got sloppy and was busted making a seriously soppy phone call to Jamie as she stepped off a flight from New York to LA.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\"She called him the minute she got off her plane and said she loved him,\" an eyewitness told Us Weekly. \"She always gushes about how amazing he is. She says he brings joy into the world.\u201d\n\nView 10 Images Was Tom the reason Jamie kept denying it?

Jamie and Katie are friends and have been for a long time. They are two adults who are attractive and single, and so apparently conclusions will be drawn,\" the insider said.\n\nSadly, those declarations were trumped when yet another pal revealed that former ladies man Jamie \u201ccut his roster\u201d for Katie, and another confirmed things were even more serious, telling OK! magazine, \"They are using the L word.\u201d\n\nPerhaps getting braver, December 2015 saw Katie attend Jamie\u2019s surprise birthday party in NYC.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 10 Images Former ladies man Jamie reportedly 'cut his roster' for Katie (Image: Splash News and Pictures)\n\nBut the biggest slip-up came in June 2016, when Jamie\u2019s friend, Real Housewives of Atlanta star, Claudia Jordan, blabbed, \"He is very happy with her. I like that he seems very happy.\u201d\n\nShe quickly back-tracked though, telling Entertainment Tonight she had \"no knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all.\u201d\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"I've never seen them together.
