And how they\u2019ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed \u2013 with Jen\u2019s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s the latest chapter in the pair\u2019s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.\n\nIt\u2019s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Brad\u2019s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,\u2019 says a source close to Brad. \u2018They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\n\u2018And for Brad, seeing how much his children \u2013 especially Shiloh \u2013 love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re pretty sure they\u2019ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together. That\u2019s all that they want.\u2019\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea \u2013 out now!\n\nAdvertisement", "images": ["https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/25425/brad-pitts-parents.jpg?resize=1024%2C682", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/chrissie-swan-the-shortcut-queen-691e509abfe28.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-20t164344.876-691eaa9997406.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-18t103613.659-691bb21f4c9ec.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/71038/michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-hollywood.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/Logo-1.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/131095/untitled-design-2023-11-08t103411331.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/25426/e4898e42e58284bb19dc2b44503b15908a3f349c.jpg?resize=1024%2C683", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/icon-phosphor-circle.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-19t145321.000-691d3f406e345.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/07/NIFLOGO_Organge.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/gettyimages-2156373625-691bc2c3a0fcf-scaled.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/121578/untitled-design-4.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/ni2546pm1_marketing-cover_v0.1-691a9098143bf-scaled.jpg?resize=1955%2C2560", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/air-fryer-1-691eadfe53bed.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?d=mm&s=128", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-19t134714.374-691d2fbe0f750.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/07/wordpress-featured-image-template-11-6863926196e99.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-19t162531.737-691d54db7671a.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-18t112445.554-691bbcd84c0f3.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/25427/brad-jen-ni-cover.jpg?resize=1024%2C683"], "top_img": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Faye James", "Faye James Is A Regular Contributor At New Idea", "Who", "Practical Parenting", "Works Across Health", "Beauty", "Celebrity", "Royal Content.
