There were a lot of tears, nothing was left on the table,\" he said.\n\n\"They had it out, right there. In that moment they decided to make a fresh start - it was a 'come to Jesus meeting' that marked the beginning of a new phase in their relationship.\"\n\nBut a family friend exclusively told Mirror Online that the reports were rubbish.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\"They are both focused on putting their children's priorities first and are getting along, but this story is clearly an outsider trying to create a storyline that doesn't exist,\" said the insider.\n\nAngelina Jolie has spoken for the first time of the emotional toll of her split with Brad Pitt READ MORE :\n\nView 6 Images Ange is moving on after a tough year of divorce and health problems (Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nAngelina recently spoke for the first time of the emotional toll of her split with Brad.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThe star, 42, said the break-up last year was made worse by health problems \u2013 including a double mastectomy and Bell's Palsy.\n\nShe said: \"Sometimes it appears I'm pulling it all together but really I'm just trying to get through my days. Emotionally it\u2019s been a very difficult year.\n\n\"I don't enjoy being single. It's not something I wanted. There's nothing nice about it.
