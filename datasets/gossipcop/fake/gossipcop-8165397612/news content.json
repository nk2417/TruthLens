She is just having fun, seeing where things go.\"\n\nAniston and Theroux announced their split after two years of marriage in February. A week later, a source told ET that the actress was enjoying the single life for the time being. \"She won't fall in love anytime soon,\" the source revealed. \"All her friends are around her. That is the best supportive group.\"\n\nTheroux, meanwhile, cleared his head after the breakup by hitting the gym and traveling the world. He was spotted enjoying the company of friends, including Emma Stone and Sienna Miller, in Cannes, France, in May. He even sparked romance rumors with Spider-Man: Homecoming star Laura Harrier, though a source told ET at the time that he wasn't jumping into another romance.\n\n\u201cJustin is not in a relationship,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe\u2019s super social and loves meeting new people and collaborating on ideas with friends. These days he\u2019s been spending time with friends and family -- he\u2019s super close with his brother.\"\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/aniston_823131676.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-05/jen_aniston_friends.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-06/1280-gettyimages-969404602.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-06/950_justin_theroux.jpg?h=85388c76&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-11/eto_news_daily_pete_ariana_110118.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/aniston_823131676.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/jennifer-aniston-is-casually-dating-after-split-from-justin-theroux-105601", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Is 'Casually Dating' After Split From Justin Theroux", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/aniston_823131676.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "A source tells ET that the 49-year-old actress is having fun 'seeing where things go.'", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Is 'Casually Dating' After Split From Justin Theroux", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jennifer-aniston-is-casually-dating-after-split-from-justin-theroux-105601", "type": "Article"}, "description": "A source tells ET that the 49-year-old actress is having fun 'seeing where things go.'", "twitter": {"description": "A source tells ET that the 49-year-old actress is having fun 'seeing where things go.'", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Is 'Casually Dating' After Split From Justin Theroux", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jennifer-aniston-is-casually-dating-after-split-from-justin-theroux-105601", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/aniston_823131676.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Jennifer Aniston Is 'Casually Dating' After Split From Justin Theroux  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
