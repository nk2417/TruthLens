{"url": "www.glamour.com/story/chrissy-teigen-postpartum-depression", "text": "By December I had started my second cookbook. With the first, I was in the kitchen the whole time. I stirred every pot, tasted everything. Had genuine excitement for Every. Single. Recipe. This one came at the height of my losing my appetite, and the idea of having to test and taste recipes actually made me vomit. I was still on the couch a lot.\n\nBefore the holidays I went to my GP for a physical. John sat next to me. I looked at my doctor, and my eyes welled up because I was so tired of being in pain. Of sleeping on the couch. Of waking up throughout the night. Of throwing up. Of taking things out on the wrong people. Of not enjoying life. Of not seeing my friends. Of not having the energy to take my baby for a stroll. My doctor pulled out a book and started listing symptoms. And I was like, \u201cYep, yep, yep.\u201d I got my diagnosis: postpartum depression and anxiety. (The anxiety explains some of my physical symptoms.)\n\nI remember being so exhausted but happy to know that we could finally get on the path of getting better. John had that same excitement. I started taking an antidepressant, which helped. And I started sharing the news with friends and family\u2014I felt like everyone deserved an explanation, and I didn\u2019t know how else to say it other than the only way I know: just saying it. It got easier and easier to say it aloud every time. (I still don\u2019t really like to say, \u201cI have postpartum depression,\u201d because the word depression scares a lot of people. I often just call it \u201cpostpartum.\u201d Maybe I should say it, though. Maybe it will lessen the stigma a bit.)\n\nI wanted to write an open letter to friends and employers to explain why I had been so unhappy. The mental pain of knowing I let so many people down at once was worse than the physical pain. To have people that you respect, who are the best in the business, witness you at your worst is tough. Even though this was something I shouldn\u2019t have to apologize for, I did want to apologize. Because on a set, people depend on you. A lot of people are coming together and all you have to do, Christine, is put on a unicorn head and shoot a money gun. Editors are wondering what the f-ck happened to the girl they gave a book deal to. This shit was flying through my head and I felt horrible.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/58b73f7444ad5e14c23a03a9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/chrissy-teigen-april17-01.jpg",
