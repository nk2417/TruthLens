This royal couple is literally destined to be King and Queen of England and, as such, their relationship is extremely...polished.\n\nNo one knows what really goes on behind the gilded (I\u2019m assuming) doors of Adelaide Cottage, but Kate and William\u2019s love story has always been presented as a fairy tale. And it probably is! But like any couple who met in college, William and Kate\u2019s relationship hasn\u2019t been without its bumps. On that note, let\u2019s walk through a timeline of their romance\u2014including the ups and the downs.\n\nCirca 2001\n\nWilliam and Kate connect at University of Saint Andrews. Here\u2019s a picture of them at their graduation ceremony for proof, in case you live life by the motto \u201cpics or it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nCirca 2003\n\nWilliam and Kate begin dating after he\u2019s apparently mind-blown watching her model in a charity auction wearing this gem:\n\nMalcolm Clarke/Daily Mail/REX/Shutterstock // Shutterstock\n\nAccording to E! News, William was all, \u201cWow, Fergus, Kate\u2019s hot!\u201d to some dude named Fergus.\n\nAnd according to author Robert Jobson, their relationship was actually revealed during a game of \u201cNever Have I Ever\u201d with friends, when William\u2019s ex Carly exposed his \u201csecret love affair with Catherine, much to the Prince\u2019s chagrin.\u201d\n\nJanuary 2004\n\nWilliam and Kate are spotted on a ski holiday together! Here he is wearing some kewl glasses:\n\nGetty Images\n\nAnd here she is low-key matching her man:\n\nGetty Images\n\nMarch 18, 2006\n\nKate is seen kissing William at his polo match, and they seem relatively unbothered by the cameras:\n\nGetty Images\n\nJuly 15, 2006\n\nKate shows up at another one of William\u2019s polo matches, and he trots over to her smiling gleefully on this magnificent STEED. (She\u2019s the one in the halter dress, FYI.)\n\nGetty Images\n\nChristmas 2006\n\nWilliam reportedly cancels his plans to spend Christmas with Kate\u2019s family, causing her to second-guess everything. Per Vanity Fair royal reporter Katie Nicholl, \u201cat the last minute, William had a change of heart and decided to stay with his own family instead,\u201d deciding to inform a \u201ctearful\u201d Kate on Boxing Day. Wow. Cold.\n\nFebruary 10, 2007\n\nKate is seen attending some sort of ~sports game~ with William and his brother, Harry. Please note: This photo was taken mere months before William and Kate\u2019s breakup.\n\nGetty Images\n\nSpring 2007\n\nNews breaks that William and Kate have called it quits. \u201cWe were both very young,\u201d William later explained during his engagement interview with Kate. \u201cWe were both finding ourselves and such and being different characters and such.\u201d\n\nIt seems like William was the one to initiate the split (HOW DARE HE), and the internet circa 2007 had some insane theories about why, including:\n\nKate accidentally used the word \u201ctoilet\u201d in front of the queen, an alleged incident that was\u2014I kid you not\u2014known as Toiletgate. William moved to an army camp in Dorset, causing their relationship to endure a long-distance strain.\n\nEither way, royal expert Robert Jobson writes in his book about Kate (excerpted in the Daily Mail) that William dumped his future wife in an \u201cemotionally charged 30-minute conversation.\u201d\n\nAlso Spring 2007\n\nKate goes through it post-breakup, fleeing the country to visit Ireland and making it clear that her new motto is fully \u201cthank u, next.\u201d Behold, Kate not giving a fuck:\n\nGetty Images\n\nMeanwhile, William endures awkward interviews about his breakup, which you can read about right this way:\n\nRelated Story Watch Prince William Get Grilled on His Breakup\n\nJune 2007\n\nKate reportedly starts dating William\u2019s best friend, shipping heir Henry Ropner. If that\u2019s not the ultimate revenge, IDK what is.\n\nJuly 1, 2007\n\nKate attends a tribute concert for Princess Diana, sitting a few rows behind William and Harry. Rumors of a reunion begin to ~swirl~.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMarch 19, 2008\n\nKate and William are officially back together! The happy couple are seen shredding their way down some fresh powder on a ski trip. JK, they\u2019re just, like, standing there.\n\nGetty Images\n\nPer Robert Jobson\u2019s aforementioned biography, they reconciled at a friend\u2019s party where Kate was dressed as a nurse: \u201cShe\u2019d arrived dressed as a nurse and William had made a beeline for her. They then spent the first part of the evening deep in conversation before hitting the dance floor, where they ended up kissing. When friends joked they should get a room, they sloped off together.\u201d\n\nApril 2008\n\nKate accompanies William to his RAF graduation ceremony. Seems pretty official!\n\nGetty Images\n\nOctober 2010\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton get engaged in Kenya. \u201cWe had a little private time away together with some friends, and I just decided it was the right time, really,\u201d William said. \u201cWe\u2019d been talking about marriage for a while, so it wasn\u2019t a massively big surprise, but I took her up somewhere nice in Kenya.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nNovember 16, 2010\n\nWilliam and Kate announce said engagement, and the couple gives an ultra-cute engagement interview:\n\nApril 29, 2011\n\nWilliam and Kate get married! GLORY BE!\n\nJuly 9, 2011\n\nKate and William get their PDA on at a polo match:\n\nGetty Images\n\nJuly 22, 2013\n\nKate gives birth to the sassy icon known as Prince George:\n\nGetty Images\n\nMay 2, 2015\n\nKate gives birth to Princess Charlotte. Yay!\n\nGetty Images\n\nMarch 14, 2017\n\nWilliam causes a low-key scandal while dad-dancing on a ski trip in Switzerland sans Kate.\n\nFootage shows William putting his hand on a mystery woman\u2019s waist, and apparently, Kate isn\u2019t thrilled, with a source telling Vanity Fair, \u201cIt was William\u2019s choice to go away, but make no mistake, Kate wears the trousers in their marriage and she won\u2019t be happy with William\u2019s antics. She thought his partying days and larking around with the boys was a thing of the past. I imagine she\u2019ll find this humiliating and William will have come in for a pasting.\u201d\n\nWow, no quote has ever been more British!\n\nApril 23, 2018\n\nKate gives birth to Prince Louis! Yay!\n\nGetty Images\n\nApril 4, 2019\n\nInTouch publishes a report saying Kate confronted William about having an affair with their family friend and newly minted \u201crural rival\u201d Rose Hanbury. After the rumors spread, \u201cpressure was applied by the Palace,\u201d allegedly.\n\nFebruary 2, 2020\n\nKate and William attended the BAFTAs and sat through Brad Pitt making jokes about Prince Harry leaving the royal family and Rebel Wilson\u2019s about Prince Andrew. (Fast-forward to 00:42 if you want to see Will and Kate trying really hard not to cringe and look upset.)\n\nAccording to sources of Fox News\u2019s Neil Sean, Will and Kate were much more upset than the two-second clip let on. Sean said they were most upset by Rebel\u2019s joke and \u201cthis was not met with the smiling faces that you saw on the final edited version of the show. A mole also told me that to ensure that the royals are not embarrassed or made fun of again at such a prestigious event like this one\u2026.\u201d\n\nFebruary 6, 2020\n\nWelp, after a testy year filled with affair rumors and a major feud that consumed the entire family, Will and Kate are much closer, with their busy work schedules bringing them together.\n\nCirca August 2021\n\nNews breaks that William and Kate (who spent much of the pandemic in their country home) are considering a move to Windsor in order to be closer to the queen and Kate\u2019s family.\n\nJune 17, 2022\n\nAfter a chill year full of royal balcony appearances and fancy hats, a source tells the Daily Mail that \u201cscrutiny and gossip\u201d about Kate and Wills\u2019s relationship is false. \u201cIt\u2019s just b******s,\u201d says a friend from their circle. \u201cThey honestly couldn\u2019t be happier as a couple. You can\u2019t get a cigarette paper between them. They are so tight, just inseparable.\u201d\n\nSamir Hussein // Getty Images\n\nAnother source notes, \u201cThey spend all their time together. They lunch together every day, they sit and watch television together every evening. They do go out and see their own friends, of course, but they spend an inordinate amount of time together and live a very conventional married life. They aren\u2019t a flashy couple\u2014he likes his motorbikes but that\u2019s about it. They are both very outdoorsy people and spend every minute they aren\u2019t working with their children. That\u2019s what they really care about.\u201d\n\nJuly 6, 2022\n\nKate and Wills have a super-rare PDA moment, sharing a kiss at William\u2019s polo match!\n\nMax Mumby/Indigo // Getty Images\n\nCirca August, 2022\n\nKate and Wills move their family into Adelaide Cottage in order to be closer to their kids\u2019 schools and closer to their London base at Kensington Palace.\n\nSeptember 9, 2022\n\nKate and William officially become the Prince and Princess of Wales in the wake of the Queen\u2019s death and King Charles\u2019s ascension to the throne. In the coming weeks, there are talks about the couple moving into Windsor Castle because of the #promotion, which we now know winds up happening.\n\nAnd yep, they change their social handles to match!\n\nOctober 14, 2022\n\nA source tells Us Weekly that William and Kate are planning for a fourth child, saying, \u201cKate has been talking about wanting another baby for a while now. She has always wanted four children, and while William was originally happy with three, she has managed to twist his arm. [Their pals] wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we\u2019ll be hearing an announcement early next year.\u201d\n\nDecember 1, 2022\n\nWilliam and Kate head to Boston for the Earthshot Prize awards and are awkwardly booed at a basketball game:\n\nDecember 14, 2022\n\nThe couple drop their 2022 Christmas photo amid Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s Netflix docuseries:\n\nNaturally, a body language expert has a LOT to say.\n\nJanuary 17, 2023\n\nWills lauds his wife\u2019s skills in the kitchen during a visit to the charity Together as One, where he is a part of a cooking lesson. \u201cI do a bit of cooking, not much though,\u201d he says. \u201cCatherine\u2019s very good though.\u201d S\u2019cute!\n\nFebruary 9, 2023\n\nThe duo pay a visit to Cornwall, marking their first official joint visit there since becoming the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall. During the trip, Kate and William tour the National Maritime Museum Cornwall and take a look at the refurbishment progress on the Kiwi, a 14-foot sailing dinghy that actually served as a wedding present to Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip from the Royal New Zealand Navy. \u201cIf she sinks up here, we were never here, okay? You never saw us,\u201d the prince jokes. Lighthearted vibes all around!\n\nFebruary 19, 2023\n\nThe Prince and Princess of Wales arrive at the 76th EE BAFTA Film Awards, where Kate and William share a cheeky moment. Ahem, observe:\n\nMarch 12, 2023\n\nDuring an interview with Fox News Digital, royal author Tom Quinn spills all the goss on Kate and Williams\u2019s \u2019ship, from the different approaches they take when they argue and the deeper meanings of the nicknames they have for each other to how they want their parenting style to be different than the generations before them. But more on that here:\n\nApril 3, 2023\n\nA \u201csource\u201d reportedly tells a tabloid (so take this with several grains of salt) that Kate didn\u2019t think William defended her enough after the publication of Prince Harry\u2019s memoir Spare, saying, \u201cKate felt William should stick up for her more. Yet William and the Palace thought that saying nothing was best.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, royal author Tom Quinn writes in his new book, Gilded Youth: An Intimate History of Growing Up in the Royal Family, that \u201cit\u2019s not all sweetness\u201d for Wills and Kate, going on to say that \u201cthey have terrible rows\u201d and that \u201cKate might seem to be a very calm person, and William also. But it\u2019s not always true.\u201d\n\nApril 29, 2023\n\nThe couple celebrate their 12-year anniversary!\n\nWe later find out that William gifted Kate one his his later mother\u2019s heirloom diamond rings as well as a replica of the bouquet Kate carried at their wedding. Meanwhile, the Princess of Wales gave her husband a sketch of them at university, which he was \u201cblown away\u201d by.\n\nMay 5, 2023\n\nA source dishes to Us Weekly about Kate and William\u2019s relationship, saying, \u201cNo marriage is perfect, including Kate and William\u2019s and they\u2019ve certainly had their ups and downs over the years. They bicker like most couples and have recently been under pressure dealing with the drama surrounding Prince Harry.\u201d\n\nThe insider adds that Kate and William\u2019s \u201cmarital struggles have also been heightened\u201d by \u201cnonstop\u201d royal duties but that \u201cregardless of the obstacles, the couple always pulls through\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019re in a marvelous place in their lives and squeezed in some valuable time together to mark their 12th anniversary.\u201d\n\nMay 22, 2023\n\nRoyal author Tom Quinn speaks to a source who claims that Kate treats Wills \"like a fourth child\" thanks to his propensity for tantrums.\n\nPer the source (via The Mirror), \"Kate treats him like the fourth child because he\u2019s prone to tantrums. They do have rows. It\u2019s not a perfect marriage. They have terrific rows. But where some couples have a row and throw heavy vases at each other, William and Kate throw cushions at each other. It\u2019s always kept under control.\u201d\n\nJuly 6, 2023\n\nPrince William\u2019s team, the U.S. Polo Association, takes home a sweet victory at the Royal Charity Polo Day, and Kate happily congratulates her husband with a hug and a kiss on each cheek. \ud83e\udd7a\u2764\ufe0f\n\nCharlie Crowhurst // Getty Images\n\nCharlie Crowhurst // Getty Images\n\nAugust 20, 2023\n\nThe couple has a cover star moment and appears on the summer issue of Mountain Rescue magazine (aka the only official magazine for mountain rescue in England, Wales, Scotland, *and* Ireland).
