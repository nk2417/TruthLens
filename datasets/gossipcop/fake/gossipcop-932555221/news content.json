Selena has tried to convince her family that Justin has changed but her family just isn\u2019t budging right now.\u2019\n\nJustin looked in high spirits (Picture: Backgrid)\n\nOf course, nothing has been heard from the horse\u2019s mouth but Biebs and the 25-year-old singer have not been pictured together for some time now adding fuel to the break-up rumours \u2013 and now these images of Justin looking comfy with another woman have pretty much started a blaze of speculation.\n\nHowever, a source later told People magazine this could not be further from the truth.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re not on a break because of her relationship with her mum,\u2019 they explained. \u2018They have their own issues and are always on and off.\u2019\n\nJustin Bieber and Selena Gomez recently reunited (Picture: WireImage)\n\n\u2018She wouldn\u2019t base her relationship off of what her mum thinks,\u2019 they added.\n\nWell \u2013 it\u2019s good to see Justin in high spirits as he was pictured looking pretty emotional last week when he was out and about with dad, Jeremy.\n\nAt one point, the emotional star could be seen covering his face with his hands \u2013 in a possible bid to hide his tears \u2013 while waiting in the car for his dad.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
