Whoops!\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nIt gave a group of friends settling down for a round of Christmas trivia a good laugh though.\n\nPrince George wears SHORTS for chilly Christmas Day outing to church READ MORE :\n\nView 8 Images Trivia game blunder says Prince Harry and Kate Middleton had a baby\n\nView 8 Images William and Kate with their children George and Charlotte (Image: WENN.com)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nThe question reads: \"Prince Harry and Kate Middleton welcomed their second child in 2015, a girl named?\"\n\nIt gives the answer as \"Charlotte\", which would be right, if Harry were her father.\n\nOf course it's Kate's husband and Harry's big brother, Prince William, who welcomed his baby girl into the world last year.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nThe trivia fan who found the mistake said: \"It was just so random, I couldn't believe it when I saw it. It really made me laugh.\"\n\nView 8 Images The game is advertised by Tesco\n\nView 8 Images Kate Middleton with daughter Charlotte (Image: Ian Vogler/Daily Mirror)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nAnd as we all know, Harry is dating Suits actress Meghan Markle.\n\nThe 32-year-old prince spent a traditional Christmas Day at the Royals\u2019 Sandringham, before sources say he jetted off to Canada to be with Meghan, 35.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nA source said: \u201cHarry is desperate to be with her as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cNormally he\u2019d be with the rest of the family, but seeing as William is at the Middletons\u2019 for Christmas it looks like he\u2019s being allowed to break with tradition.\u201d\n\nThe trivia game, which is made in China, is listed on Tesco 's website, although it is not currently for sale.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nThe supermarket's website states that the game includes 90 question and answer cards, but makes yet another mistake when it gives examples of some of the questions, asking which \"US sitcome\" Zooey Deschanel stars in.\n\nView 8 Images The game was made in China\n\nView 8 Images Prince Harry is dating actress Meghan Markle (Image: REUTERS)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 8 Images Meghan stars in Suits (Image: WireImage)\n\nHarry and Meghan spent Christmas apart following a romantic week in London, during which they made a low-key appearance in the middle of one of the capital's busiest areas.\n\nThe two were spotted having a private joke as they strolled through Piccadilly Circus and up Shaftesbury Avenue towards the Gielgud Theatre, where the prince had bought them last-minute tickets to The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time -
