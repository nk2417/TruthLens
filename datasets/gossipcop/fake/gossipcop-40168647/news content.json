Meanwhile, Orlando has been with stars like Kate Bosworth, Selena Gomez, and ex-wife Miranda Kerr.\n\nPerry and Bloom started dating in early 2016 after meeting at a Golden Globes after party. And although there were reports that they were breaking up in early 2017, it seems the couple may have reconciled and are giving love another go \u2014 and according to some sources, may have already gotten eloped! Their relationship is not without its drama, though.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Bloom infamously went paddleboarding naked with Perry.\n\nWhile on a romantic getaway to Italy with Perry, Bloom left nothing to the imagination and stripped naked for a paddleboard ride and of course, the paps were there to snap some photos. Unsurprisingly, these photos spread over the internet like wildfire.\n\nIn an interview with Elle UK, Bloom admitted he had no idea there was paparazzi following them. \"I've been photographed a million times in a million ways. I have a good radar,\" he stated. \"We'd been completely alone for five days. Nothing around us. There was no way anyone could get anything. So I had a moment of feeling free.\"\n\nAfter seeing the photo, Bloom admitted to Elle that had he known he was being watched and photographed, \"I wouldn't have put myself in that position if I'd thought it would happen.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRELATED: Orlando Bloom Exposed His Penis And The Photos Are Really Something\n\n2.

Online, Perry admitted the split was difficult on her, stating, \"He's a very smart man, a magical man and I was in love with him when I married him. Let's just say I haven't heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011.\" Ouch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to E! News, in his 2015 documentary BRAND: The Second Coming, Brand allegedly mocks his relationship with Perry. \"I'm living this life of the very thing I detest,\" he says before the footage cuts to images of him and Perry. \"Vapid, vacuous celebrity.\"\n\n3. Bloom allegedly cheated on ex-wife Miranda Kerr.\n\nBloom was married to Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr for three years, whom he shares a son with. The couple shared a rough split in 2013 after reports surfaced of Bloom cheating on Kerr with a 21-year-old waitress in London.\n\nDespite the harsh accusations, the two now have a good friendship and co-parenting skills. Kerr opened up to Marie Clare UK about her relationship with Bloom, stating the divorce was the \"the right thing to do,\" explaining, \"we weren't bringing out the best in each other.\" She continued, saying, \"There\u2019s no hostility there, we\u2019ll always be friends.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4.

Photos taken of the two show they were all over each other.

Back in 2012, Bloom and Bieber reportedly got in a fight while in Ibiza due to the rumors about Bieber and Kerr. Bloom reportedly threw a punch at Bieber after some words were exchanged.
