The singer and her beau may have had their happily ever after in secret ceremony, according to OK! magazine, May 10!\n\n\u201cIt might seem crazy after such a sort time, but everyone in her life says they\u2019ve never seen her this happy,\u201d a source close to Brit told the mag. \u201cGetting married secretly is just the sort of stunt she\u2019d pull. Only now, she\u2019s in a stable place emotionally.\u201d Wow!\n\nIF Brit and Sam did tie the knot, there\u2019s some reported obstacles he had to go through first. \u201cShe would never marry Sam without asking her boys\u2019 permission first,\u201d the source said. Britney has two sons \u2014 Sean, 11, and Jayden James, Federline, 10 \u2014 with her ex-husband, Kevin Federline, 39. However, that wasn\u2019t an issue for the young model, as reported by the mag.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s great with her boys, which is always her number one priority before she can get serious about someone.\u201d And, get this \u2014 Friends of Brit\u2019s have claimed that they\u2019ve [the boys] suggested that she should\u2019ve proposed to Sam.\n\nThe last person Sam would reportedly have to win over is Brit\u2019s father, Jamie Spears. Ever since Spears gained conservatorship over his daughter \u2014 after her 2007 breakdown \u2014 he\u2019s super protective. Although he reportedly thinks Brit does well with a man on her arm, marriage, on the other hand, is a different story. \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t be happy if she\u2019s done it without a prenup,\u201d the mag reported. Not to mention, Brit\u2019s only known Sam for less than a year.\n\nBut when it comes down to it, \u201cBrit feels certain about her future with Sam,\u201d the mag said. In fact, \u201cShe\u2019s telling friends that she\u2019s never loved a man like she loves him.\u201d OMG!\n\nBrit and Sam met on the set of her music video for \u201cSlumber Party\u201d in Nov. 2016. Sam played her sexy love interest in the video. Then, during that same month, the two were spotted on multiple dates with each other. Soon after, Brit and Sam began posting adorable photos together. And, the rest is history!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Britney and Sam are seriously married?", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/britney-spears-sam-asghari-married-ftr.jpg?resize=384%2C216", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Britney-Spears-Date-Night-Sam-Asghari-BG-1.jpg?fit=440%2C293", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/britney-spears-sam-asghari-married-ftr.jpg?fit=600%2C798", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Britney-Spears-Date-Night-Sam-Asghari-BG-2.jpg?fit=293%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/britney-spears-and-sam-asghari-3.jpg?fit=375%2C440"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/britney-spears-sam-asghari-married-ftr.jpg?fit=600%2C798", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/05/10/britney-spears-married-sam-asghari-secret-wedding/", "title": "Britney Spears Marries Model BF Sam Asghari In Secret Ceremony \u2014 Report", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "A wedding and a baby?
