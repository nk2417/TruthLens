And, like most pop star-on-pop star feuds which appear to exist solely in the minds of fans, it\u2019s the type of thing that the two are constantly having to deny. Twice this week Jennifer Lopez has had to address it and, twice this week, Lopez has denied it.\n\nSo here\u2019s how the whole thing went down.\n\nThe Beginnings\n\nIn the early \u201800s, Mariah Carey was doing an interview with a foreign TV station in which she was asked her opinion about several pop stars. She called Beyonc\u00e9 \u201cnice\u201d and \u201ca good writer\u201d and then she was asked about Jennifer Lopez. \u201cI don\u2019t know her,\u201d Mariah Carey said. And, immediately, a meme was born.\n\nIf you\u2019ve not seen the GIF, you\u2019ve probably not spent a lot of time on the web.\n\nThe Aftermath\n\nIt is years later; \u201cI don\u2019t know her\u201d has become perhaps the most iconic words to come out of Mariah Carey\u2019s mouth since \u201call I want for Christmas is you.\u201d It was Andy Cohen, in 2014, who was the first to ask J.Lo directly about the shade of it all.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cI know from back in the day, I\u2019ve read things that she\u2019s said about me that were not the greatest, but we have never met,\u201d Lopez, who is no amateur at delivering a verbal knockout, said. \u201cLike, we don\u2019t know each other. I think it\u2019s kind of from word of mouth of things that have happened in the past that I\u2019m not really aware of.\u201d\n\n\n\nThen, last year, Carey was doing an interview with The Cut in which she was asked about gifts she receives from her army of fans, the \u201cLambs.\u201d\n\nRecently? I don\u2019t know. [yawns] I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m having a \u201csleep\u201d moment\u2026\n\n\n\nWell, there was a very interesting shirt that a fan made with a quote that I said years ago that, when I said it, I really wasn\u2019t trying to be funny. I was just being honest and everybody\u2019s kind of blowing it out of proportion but this guy had a shirt on and it was a picture of me that he made and the quote was underneath it \u2014 and I\u2019m going to leave you hanging as to what it was.\n\nTo recap: Carey yawns before she explains she was \u201cjust being honest.\u201d The word shade is thrown around hyperbolically these days, but true shade doesn\u2019t really sound like an insult. However, the recipient knows. Mariah Carey is one of the masters of the art.\n\nRound Two\n\nTalk of the feud picked up after last year\u2019s Billboard Music Awards, at which Lopez was caught checking Instagram during Carey\u2019s performance. Video of Lopez idly scrolling through her feed immediately became Lopez\u2019s visual response to Carey\u2019s \u201cI don\u2019t know her\u201d GIF.\n\nWhich Brings Us to This Week\u2026\n\nJennifer Lopez is currently on a media blitz promoting the staggering number of projects \u2014 Shades of Blue, American Idol, The Fosters, etc. \u2014 she\u2019s currently working on. Her first stop was Watch What Happens Live where, again, Andy Cohen asked about Mariah Carey.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cFirst of all, that was not fair with the texting thing because I watched a lot of it \u2014 it was a long performance,\u201c Lopez said, in what is not not shade. \u201cI watched most of it, I may have looked down for one second and people were like, \u2018Look at her! Look at her!\u2019\u201d\n\nLopez then booked it over to The Wendy Williams Show where she was talking about her Vegas residency, saying she saw all the shows currently on before she signed her deal, except for Mariah Carey because Carey\u2019s show didn\u2019t start until Lopez was already back in New York to film Shades of Blue. Williams saw her chance and took it with the gusto of a bird of prey.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d the talk show host joked of Carey. \u201cNo, I\u2019m playing because that\u2019s what Mariah said about Jennifer one time.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cShe does say that,\u201d Lopez responded, before delivering her magnum opus. \u201cShe\u2019s forgetful I guess.\u201d\n\n", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ydcw.VgnLruEG2vlBxkXGw--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yMjA7cT05NTt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mashed_slideshows_555/d80c8ae3ca16bf62f6d0e7c51c70def3.cf.webp", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/vh4FaQatIGbIyqgJP.qyqw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTQyMDtoPTI4MztjZj13ZWJw/http://33.media.tumblr.com/8fa2abc7b4cd76363619478ff22f3b2c/tumblr_inline_o3j4r5jfQQ1twign1_500.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Q6k5DocPQLSy7W3RMnvPhw--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yMjA7cT05NTt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/tasting_table_slideshows_592/7006cec84e355714d1739a3c0e8ee856.cf.webp", "https://s.yimg.com/cd/resizer/2.0/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w540/9513046fe37e03434f383db5fd2e314d225278b2.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_p_entertainmentv2_2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Jxa66X7vyI2f3rF30u7t_w--~B/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTQwO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT0xMDA7dz00MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/253f3af0-33ff-11eb-bb6f-d3badfe9f98e.cf.webp", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DTcQFCoiesNJutJBS8_Tfg--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD0yMjA7cT05NTt3PTIyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/slash_gear_slideshows_548/35df45e634ee5beeca57b79d3c642b9f.cf.webp", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0KcXmekO1lOQ4TRcmr1big--~B/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTQwO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT0xMDA7dz00MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/91316da0-7ec8-11f0-9a43-4f75b8096ad9.cf.webp", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9WdpuBXRnU6YZv8h1KIkhw--~B/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTQwO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT0xMDA7dz00MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-08/c4f779f0-7ec7-11f0-bfff-9c463c8b72c5.cf.webp", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DNcb1dzenld8ju38LLaPcw--~B/Zmk9ZmlsbDtoPTQwO3B5b2ZmPTA7cT0xMDA7dz00MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2025-09/383dc5e0-9dd6-11f0-abdf-53eb82bd188e.cf.webp", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/0KH3.1nXOuziySLSdfJMtA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04NDk7Y2Y9d2VicA--/http://40.media.tumblr.com/5769ab2f892079f6515b01d26340dc4c/tumblr_inline_o3j99bqCzh1twign1_1280.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/EMppPwTkMyY_YAtS5Dn0eg--~B/Zmk9c3RyaW07aD00MDA7cT05NTt3PTYyNDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/86086d178a5d1646e7cb26edddd97b76.cf.webp"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/cd/resizer/2.0/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w540/9513046fe37e03434f383db5fd2e314d225278b2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/heres-a-complete-history-of-jennifer-lopez-and-213047207.html", "title": "Here\u2019s a Complete History of Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey\u2019s Alleged Feud", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey (Photos: Getty Images)", "keywords": "Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, Andy Cohen", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "conf": {"cjs": {"consent-flow": "yguce", "locale": "en-US"}}, "oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Yahoo", "creator": "@Yahoo", "title": "Here\u2019s a Complete History of Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey\u2019s Alleged Feud", "description": "Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey (Photos: Getty Images)", "image": "https://s.yimg.com/cd/resizer/2.0/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w540/9513046fe37e03434f383db5fd2e314d225278b2.jpg"}, "og": {"title": "Here\u2019s a Complete History of Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey\u2019s Alleged Feud", "description": "Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey (Photos: Getty Images)", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/heres-a-complete-history-of-jennifer-lopez-and-213047207.html", "site_name": "Yahoo Entertainment", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/cd/resizer/2.0/FIT_TO_WIDTH-w540/9513046fe37e03434f383db5fd2e314d225278b2.jpg", "height": 369, "width": 540}, "type": "article"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=6b79cc81-7709-395c-a650-e26345a15004&src=web"}, "android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=6b79cc81-7709-395c-a650-e26345a15004&src=web"}}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQAEFc4tjb4?feature=oembed&enablejsapi=1&origin=https://safe.txmblr.com&wmode=opaque"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
