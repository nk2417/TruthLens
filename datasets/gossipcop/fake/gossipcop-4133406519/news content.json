Ex-lovers Robert Pattinson, 28, and Kristen Stewart, 32, attended Lily-Rose Depp\u2019s 19th birthday party on June 1. However, don\u2019t expect their love to rise from the grave. \u201cThere\u2019s no chance of any kind of romantic reconciliation for Rob and Kristen,\u201d a source close to Rob EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. \u201cThat ship has well and truly sailed, and way too much has passed between them to ever reunite in that way. Plus, Kristen is really happy with Stella [Maxwell], they have an amazing relationship.\u201d\n\nWhile there\u2019s no chance that RPatz and KStew will date again, it\u2019s not all bad, as the source tells HollywoodLife.com that Rob thinks it\u2019s \u201cgreat\u201d that they\u2019ve \u201cfinally got to a place where they can be friendly when they see each other in public. Rob would love to see more of Kristen, he still cares for her deep down, and probably always will\u2014she was his first real love.\u201d As for Kristen, she \u201cfeels a little awkward when she sees Rob,\u201d because she still \u201ccarries a lot of guilt\u201d from how their romance ended (you know, what with her cheating on him with Snow White and the Huntsman director Rupert Sanders.) However, the source says that Rob has repeatedly told her that \u201ceverything is good between them, and he doesn\u2019t harbor any bad feelings towards her.\u201d\n\nToo bad, Twilight fans. Bella\u2019s not getting back with Edward \u2013 or Jacob, for that matter. This should come as no surprises, as the two didn\u2019t really seem to be that enamored with each other at Lily-Rose\u2019s birthday party, as a source from the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles \u2013 where the bash was held \u2013 EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com that they had \u201cvery cordial conversations, but it was minimal at best.\u201d Oh, there was no drama \u2013 but there was no real chemistry either. Oh well.\n\nPrior to the birthday bash, Robert and Kristen had a \u201clow-key meet-up\u201d in February 2018. Both Twilight stars were at a bar/restaurant in Los Angeles\u2019 Silver Lake neighborhood. Eagle-eyed fans tweeted their excitement, hoping that they could \u201cmaybe start over again \u2026but this time it means forever.\u201d Sadly for these fans, the only way they can see Bella and Edward back together is in the pages of Stephenie Meyer\u2019s books.", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/kristen-stewart-robert-pattinson-reuniting-ftr.jpg?fit=330%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-over-and-done-bonnie-says-ftr.jpg?fit=330%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-talking-bonnie-says-ftr.jpg?fit=351%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-ftr.jpg?resize=384%2C216", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C349"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C349", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/06/are-robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-back-together/", "title": "Rob Pattinson Still \u2018Cares Deeply\u2019 For Kristen Stewart \u2014 Getting Back Together After Party Reunion?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart reunited at a birthday party -- so does this mean they're back together?
