Noa tried to sell a book about their relationship but Lopez sued and the manuscript was shut down. She walked away with $545,000 in compensatory damages too. In 2011, she also had to block the release of a private, intimate video that reportedly included 15 to 20 minutes of nudity from their 1997 honeymoon.\n\nLopez and Sean Combs were linked in 1999 before he was arrested in relation to a Manhattan night club shooting.\n\nSean Combs (1999): Pre-Diddy, Sean Combs began dating Lopez while she was working on her first album. But the rapper turned out to be too much of a bad boy, and they split soon after he was arrested in relation to a Manhattan night club shooting in December 1999 and charged with criminal possession of a weapon. Lopez was also charged in the incident but the charges were dropped soon after.\n\nCris Judd (2000-2002): The former backup dancer was hired to direct Lopez\u2019s \u201cLove Don\u2019t Cost a Thing\u201d in late 2000 and the couple were married by September 2001. They split less than a year later, but didn\u2019t finalize their divorce until 2003.\n\nBen Affleck (2002-2004): Bennifer began in 2002 when they filmed \u201cGigli\u201d together and peaked with a $1.2 million, 6.1-carat pink diamond ring. Hollywood\u2019s favorite couple heartbreakingly called it quits in early 2004, just before their wedding date.\n\nMarc Anthony (2004-2011): Anthony and Lopez had twins together during their seven-year marriage \u2014 which started just days after his divorce to Dayanara Torres was finalized. The salsa artist planted a kiss on Lopez at the Latin Grammys in November, but that wasn\u2019t enough to rekindle the romance.\n\nCasper Smart (2011-2016): A five-year on-and-off romance with the much younger dancer ended when Lopez reportedly caught Smart cheating.\n\nThe singer and Canadian rapper Drake were linked for a whirlwind two months.\n\nDrake (2016): The whirlwind romance that started with a cozy Instagram photo was over within two months.\n\nAlex Rodriguez\n\nRodriguez was married to Cynthia Scurtis for six years. The couple has two daughters.\n\nCynthia Scurtis (2002-2008): A-Rod\u2019s six-year marriage to Scurtis resulted in two daughters \u2014 Natasha and Ella \u2014 and ended in an ugly alimony battle.\n\nMadonna (2008): The Material Girl claimed they were just friends, but Rodriguez\u2019s wife blamed Madonna for their divorce. The third baseman was reportedly making late-night visits to Madonna\u2019s upper West Side home just weeks after his wife gave birth to their second child.\n\nBethenny Frankel (2009): The Yankees slugger spent time with the \u201cReal Housewives of New York City\u201d star in early 2009, but the hook-up was shortlived.\n\nKate Hudson (2009): Hudson was a regular guest at Yankee Stadium when the two were linked during the Bronx Bombers\u2019 World Series season.\n\nThe Yankees slugger was frequently spotted around town with Cameron Diaz during their romance.\n\nCameron Diaz (2010-2011): One of A-Rod\u2019s more public flings, he and Diaz were spotted out together frequently, most famously when she fed him popcorn at Super Bowl XLV.\n\nTorrie Wilson (2011-2015): The WWE star stuck by Rodriguez for more than three years, including during his MLB suspension in 2014.\n\nDemi Moore (2012): A-Rod and Moore were spotted on a dinner date in the West Village in July 2012 in what was considered a best friend faux pas; Madonna and Moore were longtime friends.\n\nA-Rod dated Silicon Valley tycoon Wojcicki for almost a year.\n\nAnne Wojcicki (2016-2017): The Silicon Valley tycoon settled for the retired slugger for almost a year before the two split. They made their public debut at the Met Gala in May.", "images": ["data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/03/09/AMIQF6LKST2ZXHTFJYF7GZOPDM.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/03/09/AMIQF6LKST2ZXHTFJYF7GZOPDM.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Feldman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/03/08/alex-rodriguez-and-jennifer-lopezs-dating-history-before-they-hooked-up/", "title": "Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez\u2019s dating history before they hooked up", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Kate Feldman", "canonical": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/03/08/alex-rodriguez-and-jennifer-lopezs-dating-history-before-they-hooked-up/"}, "description": "Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez\u2019s New York romance is still young but the singer and the slugger both have lengthy r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez\u2019s dating history before they hooked up", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/03/08/alex-rodriguez-and-jennifer-lopezs-dating-history-before-they-hooked-up/", "description": "Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez\u2019s New York romance is still young but the singer and the slugger both have lengthy r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.
