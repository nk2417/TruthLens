Here\u2019s everything you need to know.\n\nWhat has Miley said about their split?\n\nOn August 10, 2019, the couple announced their split, adding that they plan on carrying on as friends and nothing more.\n\nAccording to an official statement made by Miley\u2019s rep, they parted ways to \u201cfocus on themselves and careers\u201d.\n\nBut just days after the shock statement was made by a rep of the former couple, photos of Miley making out with Kaitlynn Jenner surfaced online, leading fans to believe she had cheated on Liam, which ultimately led to their split.\n\nThe allegations appeared to strike a nerve with the US pop star, who hit back on Twitter, where she said: \u201cI can admit to a lot of things but I refuse to admit that my marriage ended because of cheating.\n\n\u201cLiam and I have been together for a decade. I\u2019ve said it before & it remains true, I love Liam and always will.\u201d\n\nMiley also slammed the criticism she was getting by tweeting: \u201cI can accept that the life I\u2019ve chosen means I must live completely open and transparent with my fans who I love, and the public, 100% of the time.\n\n\u201cWhat I cannot accept is being told I\u2019m lying to cover up a crime I haven\u2019t committed. I have nothing to hide.\u201d\n\nWhy did Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth split?\n\nOn August 13, Liam posted on Instagram: \u201cJust a quick note to say that Miley and I have recently separated and I wish her nothing but health and happiness going forward.\n\n\u201cThis is a private matter and I have not made, nor will I be making, any comments to any journalists or media outlets.\n\n\u201cAny reported quotes attributed to me are false. Peace and Love.\u201d\n\nMiley\u2019s rep released a statement saying, \u201cEver evolving, changing as partners and individuals, they have decided this is what\u2019s best while they both focus on themselves and careers.\n\n\u201cThey still remain dedicated parents to all of their animals they share while lovingly taking this time apart.\u201d\n\nHow did Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth meet?\n\nMiley Cyrus, 26, had been in a relationship with Australian actor Liam Hemsworth, 28, since 2009.\n\nThe former star couple met on the set of their movie The Last Song.\n\nAt the time Liam was a virtual unknown, while Miley was a Disney pop princess.\n\nDid they call off their wedding?\n\nOn July 19, 2018, it was reported that Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth \u201ccalled off their wedding\u201d as she\u2019s \u201cnot ready to have a baby\u201d.\n\nAccording to OK!
