Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.\n\nAt such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.\n\nThe Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/17/10/screen-shot-2018-02-17-at-10.53.14.png?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/17/10/screen-shot-2018-02-17-at-10.53.14.png?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jamie-foxx-katie-holmes-dating-valentines-day-basketball-interview-walks-out-tom-cruise-divorce-a8215251.html", "title": "Jamie Foxx walks out of live interview after being asked about Katie Holmes", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/films/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "Hollywood actors have reportedly been dating since 2013", "og": {"updated_time": "2018-02-17T13:40:48.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Jamie Foxx walks out of live broadcast after being asked about Katie Holmes", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/news/jamie-foxx-katie-holmes-dating-valentines-day-basketball-interview-walks-out-tom-cruise-divorce-a8215251.html", "type": "article", "description": "Hollywood actors have reportedly been dating since 2013", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/17/10/screen-shot-2018-02-17-at-10.53.14.png?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/17/10/screen-shot-2018-02-17-at-10.53.14.png?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-17T13:40:48.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-02-17T13:40:48.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Film", "author_name": "Roisin O'Connor", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 250, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 2, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 0, "external_link_count": 1}, "date": "2018-02-17T13:40:48.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Jamie Foxx walks out of live broadcast after being asked about Katie Holmes", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Hollywood actors have reportedly been dating since 2013", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/17/10/screen-shot-2018-02-17-at-10.53.14.png?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Katie Holmes\",\"Jamie Foxx\",\"Basketball\",\"Justin Bieber\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518874848.0, "source": "http://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
