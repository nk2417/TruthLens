CNN's Don Lemon is \"perhaps the dumbest person is broadcasting\" and CBS Late Show host Stephen Colbert is a \"no-talent guy\" who talks \"filthy.\"\n\nThose were just some of the comments Trump offered when asked over dinner Monday night when asked about the media he consumes as President of the United States. But he did little to hide his frustration, explaining that he had been surprised that the journalistic criticism had gotten worse after the campaign. He also said he had been working on tuning out news that is critical of him.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been able to do something that I never thought I had the ability to do. I\u2019ve been able not to watch or read things that aren\u2019t pleasant,\" he said, maintaining that he no longer watches CNN or MSNBC. \"And it keeps you young.\"\n\nThere was little doubt, however, that he remained acutely aware of what reporters and correspondents were saying about him. He has large flat-screen televisions set up in the Treaty Room in the White House residence and in his private dining room in the West Wing. He continues to have stacks of newspapers and magazines delivered to his office suite in the West Wing.\n\n\"Washington Post , New York Times , they\u2019re really, really dishonest,\" he said, before directly addressing the TIME reporters he had invited for dinner. \"You people are quite dishonest in all fairness.\" He said he used to watch MSNBC's Joe Scarborough but no longer does. He also claimed to have helped CNN president Jeff Zucker, an old friend and business colleague, get his job at the network.\n\nThe one network he praised was Fox News, saying he watches their shows and is responsible for its ratings bump.\n\nSpokespeople for MSNBC and CBS said the networks had no comment on the president's criticism. A CNN spokesperson said, \"His comments are beneath the dignity of the office of the President.\u201d Trump's claims about CNN's Zucker have been repeatedly refuted by the executives involved.\n\nHere's an extended excerpt of his conversation with TIME:\n\nFor instance I don\u2019t watch CNN. I don\u2019t watch MSNBC. Scarborough used to treat me great. But because I don\u2019t do interviews and stuff and want to \u2026 He went the other way. Which is fine. He\u2019s got some problems. But I don\u2019t watch the show anymore. It drives him crazy. I don\u2019t watch the show. I do watch Fox in the morning, and their ratings have gone through the roof because everyone knows I\u2019m watching Fox. But they\u2019re pleasant. And if I do something wrong they report on it. I don\u2019t mean they \u2013 if I do something wrong. But it\u2019s really, honestly it\u2019s the most accurate. CNN in the morning, Chris Cuomo, he\u2019s sitting there like a chained lunatic. He\u2019s like a boiler ready to explode, the level of hatred. And the entire, you know the entire CNN platform is that way. This Don Lemon who\u2019s perhaps the dumbest person in broadcasting, Don Lemon at night it\u2019s like \u2013 sometimes they\u2019ll have a guest who by mistake will say something good. And they\u2019ll start screaming, we\u2019re going to commercial. They cut him off. Remember? I\u2019ve seen things where by mistake somebody they bring in a guest and it turns out to be a positive. And they go, I mean they get just killed. The level of hatred. And poor Jeffrey Lord. I love Jeffrey Lord. But sometimes he\u2019s sitting there with eight unknown killers that nobody ever heard of. And CNN actually is not doing nearly as well as others. They\u2019re all doing well because of me. But it\u2019s not doing as well as others that are doing better actually. But Fox treats me very fairly. MSNBC is ridiculous. It\u2019s just bad. It\u2019s an ability I never thought I\u2019d have. I never thought I\u2019d have the ability to say, they\u2019re doing a big story on me on CNN and I won\u2019t watch it. And it\u2019s amazing, it doesn\u2019t matter. But it really, the equilibrium is much better. As far as newspapers and things, I glance at them. They\u2019re really dishonest. I mean they\u2019re really dishonest.\n\nTrump also brought up The Late Show host Stephen Colbert's blistering and crude May 1 monologue , in which the comedian delivered an oral-sex joke about the president and Russian President Vladimir Putin:", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170511160201im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/170511_jefferson-davis-statue.jpg?h=52", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170511160201im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/gettyimages-681546394.jpg?h=52", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170511160201im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/donald-trump-after-hours-facebook.jpg?w=720", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170511160201im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/ginamiller.jpg?h=52", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170511160201im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/tove-styrke.jpg?h=52"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170511160201im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/donald-trump-after-hours-facebook.jpg?w=720", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170511160201/http://time.com/4775633/donald-trump-stephen-colbert-cnn-msnbc-chris-cuomo/", "title": "President Trump Attacks 'Lunatic,' 'No-Talent,' 'Dumbest Person' in TV", "meta_data": {"description": "President Trump thinks Chris Cuomo looks like a \"chained lunatic\" on television and CNN's Don Lemon is \"the dumbest person is broadcasting.\"", "keywords": "Donald Trump, Donald Trump media, Donald Trump Stephen Colbert, Donald Trump Chris Cuomo, Donald Trump Don Lemon, Donald Trump CNN, Donald Trump MSNBC", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump, Donald Trump media, Donald Trump Stephen Colbert, Donald Trump Chris Cuomo, Donald Trump Don Lemon, Donald Trump CNN, Donald Trump MSNBC", "og": {"site_name": "Time", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170511160201/http://time.com/4775633/donald-trump-stephen-colbert-cnn-msnbc-chris-cuomo/", "title": "President Trump Attacks 'Lunatic,' 'No-Talent,' 'Dumbest Person' in TV", "description": "\"He's sitting there like a chained lunatic.\"", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170511160201im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/donald-trump-after-hours-facebook.jpg?w=720"}, "author": "Zeke J Miller, Michael Scherer", "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193}, "twitter": {"site": "@TIME", "title": "President Trump Attacks 'Lunatic,' 'No-Talent,' 'Dumbest Person' in TV", "description": "\"He's sitting there like a chained lunatic.\"", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"author": "http://time.com/author/michael-scherer/"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
