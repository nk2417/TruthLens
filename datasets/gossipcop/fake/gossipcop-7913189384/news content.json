But this year, Justin Bieber, who\u2019s b-day is on March 1, is asking for a much more meaningful present. And for those of you wondering if that involves Selena Gomez, you\u2019re correct. \u201cJustin gets to be in love and with the girl he has always wanted to be with for his birthday. He doesn\u2019t need any lavish gifts from her, he just wants to spend some alone time with her. Granted if she has anything planned as a surprise for him he will love it because he loves spending any time he can with her. He really is totally invested in their relationship,\u201d a source close to JB tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVLEY. So sweet, right?\n\nJustin Bieber\u2019s 24th birthday will certainly be a special one. This is going to be the first birthday together as a couple since rekindling their romance in 2017. And although it\u2019s only been a few months, Jelena\u2019s relationship is completely different from what it was in the past. From Justin Bieber\u2019s rededication to religion, to Selena\u2019s decision to seek treatment for anxiety, it\u2019s clear they\u2019ve matured a lot. The couple have even started going to church together! But wait, their growth doesn\u2019t end there. The singers now have marriage on the agenda.\n\nAs we previously reported, after Selena and Justin attended his dad\u2019s wedding on Feb. 19, Justin started thinking about his future with the \u201cWolves\u201d singer. \u201cJustin\u2019s really inspired right now and that has not only sparked new music from Justin, but personal conversations with his loved ones as well. Justin and Selena can absolutely see a life where they are married and enjoying kids together,\u201d a source close to the couple shared with HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Can you believe it?! Dreams really do come true. Nevertheless, we\u2019re so excited to see what Selena and Justin do for his birthday.", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/justin-bieber-spending-alone-time-with-selena-gomez-is-the-only-gift-he-wants-on-his-birthday-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C350"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/justin-bieber-spending-alone-time-with-selena-gomez-is-the-only-gift-he-wants-on-his-birthday-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C350", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robyn Merrett", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/02/28/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-birthday-gift-alone-time/", "title": "Justin Bieber: Spending Alone Time With Selena Gomez Is The Only Gift He Wants On His Birthday", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Justin Bieber wants Selena Gomez for his birthday.
