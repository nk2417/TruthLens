She appeared on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 1998 and was the first German model to become a Victoria's Secret Angel.\n\nFollowing a successful modeling career, Klum became the host and a judge of the reality shows Project Runway (2004\u20132017, 2025\u2013present) and Germany's Next Topmodel (2006\u2013present). For her work on Project Runway, she earned an Emmy nomination in 2008 and a win in 2013 for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program (shared with co-host Tim Gunn). Klum has also served as a judge on the NBC reality show America's Got Talent (2013\u20132018, 2020\u20132024). She has been nominated for six Emmy Awards.\n\nAs an occasional actress, Klum has had supporting roles in movies including Blow Dry (2001) and Ella Enchanted (2004), and made cameo appearances in The Devil Wears Prada (2006), Perfect Stranger (2007) and Ocean's 8 (2018).

She was ranked second on Forbes' list of the \"World's Top-Earning Models\". Forbes noted that since ending her 13-year run as a Victoria's Secret Angel, Klum has become more of a businesswoman than a model. In 2008, she became an American citizen while maintaining her native German citizenship.[7][8][9][10] [check quotation syntax]\n\nEarly life and discovery\n\nKlum was born and raised in Bergisch Gladbach, a city near Cologne, West Germany. She is the daughter of Erna Klum, a hairdresser,[11] and G\u00fcnther Klum,[12] a cosmetics company executive. A friend convinced her to enroll in a national modeling contest called \"Model 92\".[13] Out of 25,000 contestants, Klum was voted the winner on 29 April 1992, and she was offered a modeling contract worth US$300,000 by Thomas Zeumer, CEO of Metropolitan Models New York.[14] After winning, she appeared on the Gottschalk Late Night Show, a German television show with host Thomas Gottschalk. She accepted the contract a few months later, after graduating from school, and decided not to try for an apprentice position at a fashion design school.[15]\n\nCareer\n\nModeling and acting\n\nHeidi Klum wearing The Very Sexy Fantasy Bra 2003\n\nKlum has been featured on the cover of French, German, Portuguese and Spanish Vogue magazines, as well as Elle, InStyle, Marie Claire, Glamour and Russian Harper's Bazaar magazines.

Her runway appearances include numerous Victoria's Secret Annual Fashion Shows, walking for various designers and brands of New York Fashion Week like Zac Posen (2004), Escada, Vera Wang, Structure, Victor Alfaro, Imitation Of Christ as well as working the catwalk for Philip Treacy at Brown Thomas International Fashion Show in Dublin.\n\nAs a photo model she worked for retail clothing brands such as H & M, Ann Taylor and Peek & Cloppenburg and since 2007, she has been a celebrity spokesmodel for Jordache.[18] International tech, food and internet brands up to the automotive industry asked for Klum as their celebrity spokesperson and produced ad campaigns and TV commercials for Braun epilizer, McDonald's salad, Dannon, Carl's Jr./Hardee's (Jim Beam Bourbon Burger), the Wix website building program and, together with then-husband Seal for the Volkswagen SUV Tiguan. In addition to modeling, she has appeared in several TV shows, including Spin City, Sex and the City, Yes, Dear, and How I Met Your Mother. She had a role as an ill-tempered hair model in the movie Blow Dry, played a giantess in the movie Ella Enchanted and was cast as Ursula Andress in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. She had cameo appearances in the films The Devil Wears Prada and Perfect Stranger.\n\nHer other projects include dance and video games. She is featured in the 2003 video game James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing, where she plays the villain Dr. Katya Nadanova.[19] She has appeared in several music videos, including Jamiroquai's video \"Love Foolosophy\" from their album A Funk Odyssey, Kelis's \"Young, Fresh n' New\", off her second 2001 album Wanderland and, most recently, the second video for her then husband Seal's song \"Secret\" off his 2010 album Seal 6: Commitment. The latter video depicts the married couple sharing intimate moments while naked in bed; the concept was Klum's idea.[20] In July 2007, having earned US$8 million in the previous 16 months, Klum was named by Forbes as third on the list of the World's 15 Top-Earning Supermodels.[21]\n\nKlum at The Heart Truth Fashion Show in February 2008\n\nIn 2008, Forbes estimated her income at US$16 million, putting Klum in first place. For 2007, Forbes estimated her income at US$14 million.[22] Klum is signed to IMG Models in New York City.[23] In 2008, Klum was a featured guest on an American Volkswagen commercial, where she was interviewed by a black Beetle. When she commented that German engineering is so sexy, she caused the Beetle to blush and turn red. She has been a part of several commercials for Volkswagen and McDonald's on German television.[24] In November 2008, Klum appeared in two versions of a Guitar Hero World Tour commercial, wherein she did a take on Tom Cruise's iconic underwear dancing scene in Risky Business. In both versions, she lip-synced to Bob Seger's \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" while dancing around the living room with the wireless guitar controller.[citation needed]\n\nIn October 2009, Klum was the often-nude one-woman subject of Heidilicious,[25] a photo book by photographer Rankin. Klum ventured into web-based videos, starring in \"SPIKED HEEL: Supermodels Battle the Forces of Evil\". The web-series starred model Coco Rocha and was directed by fashion documentarian Doug Keeve. In the story, Klum aka 'The Kluminator,'[26] and her stylish sidekick Coco \"The Sassy Superhero\" Rocha battle the evil Dr. Faux Pas who is plotting to destroy Fashion Week. The heroines employ everything from blow-dryer guns to fist fights, to thwart Dr. Faux Pas' dastardly plans. The Kluminator and Girl Wonder avoid a chain of fashion disasters to neutralize a death ray that threatens to vaporize the community of fashionistas gathered in Bryant Park.[27] In 2010, Klum became the new face and creative advisor for European cosmetics brand Astor, for which she sets artistic direction and designs new products and fashion forward color collections.[28] In October 2010, Klum parted ways with Victoria's Secret after 13 years of working with the brand. She provided a simple explanation in her official statement, stating: \"All good things have to come to an end. I will always love Victoria and never tell her secret. It's been an absolute amazing time!\"[29]\n\nIt was reported in May 2011 that Klum ranked second with estimated earnings of US$20 million on Forbes' list of the World's Top-Earning Models (2010\u20132011). Forbes noted that since ending her 13-year run as a Victoria's Secret Angel, Klum has become more of a businesswoman than a model. She partnered with New Balance and Amazon.com to launch a clothing line and signed a 20-episode deal to host a new show on Lifetime, called Seriously Funny Kids.[30]\n\nSome noted fashion designers have long commented on Klum's limited role as a fashion model. Karl Lagerfeld, for example, in 2009 agreed with German designer Wolfgang Joop, who said after Klum had posed naked on the cover of the German edition of GQ magazine,[31] that she was \"no runway model. She is simply too heavy and has too big a bust\".[32] Lagerfeld observed that neither he nor Claudia Schiffer knew Klum, as she has never worked in Paris and was insignificant in the world of fashion, being \"more bling bling and glamorous than current fashion.\"[33]\n\nProducing\n\nIn December 2004, Klum became the host, judge and executive producer of the reality show Project Runway on the U.S. cable television channel Bravo (airing on Lifetime television beginning in 2009), in which fashion designers compete for the opportunity to show their line at New York Fashion Week and receive money to launch their own fashion line. She received an Emmy Award nomination for the show for each of the first four seasons.[34][35] In 2008, Klum and Project Runway received a Peabody Award, the first time a reality show won the award.[36] Klum was nominated for an Emmy in 2008 for \"outstanding host of a reality or reality-competition show\" for Project Runway, the first year that category was recognized by the Emmys.[35] Klum has been the host, judge and co-producer of Germany's Next Topmodel, the German version of the internationally successful reality television show, since 2006.

She designed shoes for Birkenstock,[44] jewelry for Mouawad, a clothing line for Jordache, and swimsuits \u2013 featured in the 2002 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue.[45] She was one of the designers of the Victoria's Secret lingerie line \"The Body\", named after the nickname she received following her first Victoria's Secret Fashion Show appearance.[46] Her Mouawad jewelry collection debuted on the cable shopping network QVC on 14 September 2006, and 14 of the 16 styles sold out after 36 minutes.[47] Klum's clothing line for Jordache launched on 30 April 2008.[48]\n\nKlum in September 2010\n\nKlum has two fragrances, called \"Heidi Klum\" and \"Me\".

As much as I love wearing beautiful lingerie and clothes, I also love not wearing too much. It's a free feeling that I've had since being a small child growing up in Germany. I had parents that never hid from me when they changed clothing or when I walked into the room. When we would go to the beach, my mom would sunbathe topless.\"[97]\n\nBesides German, Klum is fluent in English, French and Italian.[98]\n\nBomb threat during GNTM live finale\n\nDuring the live finale of the 10th season of Germany's Next Top Model in the SAP Arena on 14 May 2015, a telephone call by a woman came in at 9:07 pm, threatening that a bomb would go off during the live show. The organizer decided to have the hall evacuated and then to call the police. In the meantime, the live broadcast had been canceled and a note was shown to the television viewers, stating that the show had been interrupted due to technical issues. Later on, a man was arrested after he came near Klum, issuing another bomb threat. Thereupon, she was evacuated along with her daughter Leni and the two other judges.
