Therefore, when Justin caught wind of The Weeknd\u2019s new track, he thought it was distasteful that Abel, 28, had the nerve to hash up Selena\u2019s traumatic experience. \u201cHe was disgusted,\u201d the source admits. Although he\u2019s not with Selena, for now, we hear JB will always has her back, and this time, The Weeknd didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cCall Out My Name\u201d features more cryptic lyrics, which fans obviously decoded, claiming they too are about Selena. \u201cWe found each other / I helped you out of a broken place,\u201d part of the lyrics read, which fans believe is The Weeknd implying that he helped Selena finally get over Justin. The Weeknd goes on to sing about a relationship, and then seems to point out that he still has feelings for this person.\n\n\u201cYou gave me comfort / But falling for you was my mistake / I put you on top, I put you on top / I claimed you so proud and openly / And when times were rough, when times were rough / I made sure I held you close to me\u2026 I said I didn\u2019t feel nothing, baby, but I lied,\u201d the lyrics say.\n\nSelena and The Weeknd split in October 2017, after they first got together around January of that year. She then got back together with Bieber following the breakup. However, Jelena then ended things in early March 2018.", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jelena-vs-abelena-2.jpg?fit=440%2C367", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/justin-bieber-would-give-his-kidney-hates-the-weeknd-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C349", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jelena-vs-abelena-3.jpg?fit=440%2C367", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jelena-vs-abelena-1.jpg?fit=440%2C367"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/justin-bieber-would-give-his-kidney-hates-the-weeknd-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C349", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/02/justin-bieber-response-the-weeknd-song-selena-gomez-kidney-donor/", "title": "Justin Bieber Would Gladly Give A Kidney To Selena: He Think\u2019s The Weeknd\u2019s Song Is Petty", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Justin Bieber's got a few thoughts about The Weeknd's new song, 'Call Out My Name' which seems to suggest that he almost gave up a kidney to save Selena Gomez's life!
