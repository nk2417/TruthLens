As a matter of fact. I hadn\u2019t actually seen him in, like, four years.\u201d\n\nRelated: Unlikely Celebrity Couples They dated?! From Tom Cruise and Cher to Taylor Kinney and Lady Gaga, some celebrity couples don't always make sense to the untrained eye. Check out these unexpected celebrity romances.\n\nHowever, the actress, who is currently dating Danny Fujikawa, wasn\u2019t exactly bothered by the false reports. \u201cIt was kind of an awesome rumor,\u201d she said. \u201cI kind of liked it. I was like, \u2018OK, fine. We\u2019re having twins!\u2019\u201d\n\nAmid the rumors circulating in January, Hudson\u2019s brother Oliver took to Instagram to joke about the faux romance. \u201cYeah and it\u2019s been hell!! He\u2019s messy as s\u2013t!\u201d the Dawson\u2019s Creek alum captioned his post at the time. \u201cHe drinks out of the f\u2013king carton and leaves the door open when he\u2019s taking a dump!! And this is when he\u2019s at MY house!!! He\u2019s already calling me brother and has driven a wedge between myself and my real brother Wyatt who now won\u2019t speak to me. He insists my kids call him uncle B and lost my youngest at the Santa Monica pier for 2 days.. thank god for amber alert.\u201d\n\nRelated: Kate Hudson\u2019s Red Carpet Style Evolution Kate Hudson is a master of balancing sexy and elegant on the red carpet, while flattering her fit physique.

But ALL DAY!! Like at 3pm! And Pa [Kurt Russell] just keeps saying \u2018All right!! It\u2019s Brad Pitt!!\u2019 Anyway not going well.. so BP.. it\u2019s time to move out man.. I need my life back dog.. I\u2019ll smoke one more bowl and then get the f\u2013k out.. we thank you.. oh and I found your medical bracelet so I\u2019ll get that back to you.. ok..\u201d\n\nAlthough they never actually dated, Hudson revealed in December 2016 that she was looking for someone similar to Pitt to casually date. \u201cYou know what I really want right now? Honestly \u2014 I\u2019m just gonna be honest \u2014 I want [a] funny [guy]. Funny makes me happy. But I just want someone really hot!\u201d the Deepwater Horizon star said on Howard Stern\u2019s SiriusXM radio show at the time. \u201cLike, I just want, like, a hot guy right now. Not quite for life, you know.\u201d\n\nWhen the host asked if she\u2019d like to hook up with someone as genetically blessed as the Fight Club actor, Hudson enthusiastically responded: \u201cYes! I think Brad is very, very handsome.\u201d", "images": ["http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg",
