But pals reckon it\u2019s only a matter of time before they decide to give things another go, as they have always remained close.\u2019\n\nJen must be pretty busy at the moment as this \u2018rekindling\u2019 with Nick comes just as she\u2019s also been romantically linked to her Red Sparrow co-star, Joel Edgerton.\n\nJoel, who plays her lover in the spy thriller, apparently even introduced Jennifer to his parents during her recent stay in London with a family dinner that was a \u2018roaring success\u2019.\n\nIf there is anything going on with either of the guys then J-Law is playing it uncharacteristically cool for once. She recently declared that she was in full on \u2018single mode\u2019 and had no problems with it.\n\nTalking to The Mirror: Jen said: \u2018I am in the single mode where I am like, \u201cCool, I can do whatever I want and I can be alone and watch terrible TV\u201d.\n\n\u2018And then, of course, in a few months I will be devastatingly lonely and feel like I\u2019m on some long waiting list. But I am not there yet.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
