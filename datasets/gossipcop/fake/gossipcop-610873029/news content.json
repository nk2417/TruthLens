Anna Wintour has reigned as one of fashion's most influential figures since becoming Editor-in-Chief of American Vogue in 1988, a position she held until June 2025 when she announced she was stepping down. In September 2025, Anna revealed that she would be succeeded by Chloe Malle, the daughter of Candice Bergen.\n\nKnown for her signature bob haircut and sunglasses, she transformed Vogue into fashion's most authoritative voice while becoming a cultural icon in her own right. Beginning her career in London's fashion journalism scene, Wintour worked at Harper's & Queen and later moved to New York, where she held positions at Harper's Bazaar and New York Magazine. After a brief stint as Editor of British Vogue, she returned to New York to lead House & Garden before taking the helm at American Vogue.\n\nUnder Wintour's leadership, Vogue revolutionized fashion publishing by mixing high-end and high-street fashion, featuring celebrities on covers instead of just models, and embracing digital transformation. She was promoted to Cond\u00e9 Nast's Artistic Director in 2013 and Global Chief Content Officer in 2020, expanding her influence across the company's global brands.\n\nBeyond publishing, Wintour co-chairs the annual Met Gala, fashion's most prestigious event, and has nurtured countless fashion designers' careers through initiatives like the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund. Her formidable reputation inspired the novel and film \"The Devil Wears Prada,\" cementing her status as fashion's most powerful editor.\n\nSalary\n\nAt the peak of her time as editor-in-chief of Vogue, Anna Wintour's salary was $4 million per year.\n\nEarly Life\n\nAnna Wintour was born on November 3, 1949, in Hampstead, London. Her career began in the world of fashion before moving into journalism, largely at the behest of her parents. Her father, Charles Wintour, was the editor of the \"London Evening Standard\" for nearly two decades. Her parents were married for close to forty years and had four children together before divorcing in 1979. Sadly, Anna's older brother, Gerald, died in a car accident when they were children. Wintour attended North London Collegiate School and started dating older, well-connected men in her teens. Anna's father arranged her first job at Bib boutique when she was 15.\n\nEarly Career\n\nAnna left North London Collegiate and began a training program at Harrods while taking fashion classes at a nearby school. In 1970, Wintour was hired as an editorial assistant for the new \"Harper's & Queen\" fashion magazine. Even at this early stage of her career, she divulged to coworkers that she had the desire to edit \"Vogue\" (a desire that would grow to be fulfilled nearly 20 years later). After many disagreements with her rival, Min Hogg, Anna quit the magazine and moved to New York with her boyfriend, Jon Bradshaw.\n\nAt home in her new country, Anna started working as a junior fashion editor at \"Harper's Bazaar\" in 1975. However, she was fired after just nine months for trying to put forth daring, risque, and innovative shoots. A few months later, she got her first position at \"Viva\" as a fashion editor. However, the magazine shut down due to being unprofitable in 1978. Wintour took time off work and broke up with Bradshaw, starting a new relationship with French record producer Michel Estaban. For two years, she would divide her time between Paris and New York. Wintour returned to work in 1980 and became the fashion editor for New York. Anna finally got her chance to work for \"Vogue\" when Alex Liberman, editorial director for Conde Nast (the publisher of \"Vogue\"), clued Anna in about a position there in 1983. Wintour got the position and immediately doubled her salary when she became the magazine's first creative director. In 1985, Anna obtained her first editorship when she took over the UK edition of \"Vogue\" after Beatrix Miller retired. She replaced much of the staff and exerted more control over the magazine than previous editors had, which earned her the nickname \"Nuclear Wintour.\"\n\nIn 1987, Conde Nast requested that Wintour take over \"House & Garden,\" whose readership was flailing and lagging behind Architectural Digest. She did indeed make sweeping changes: canceling $2 million worth of photo spreads and articles in her first week and packing so much fashion onto the pages that it earned the nickname \"House & Garment.\" Ten months later, Anna Wintour became the editor of U.S. Vogue.\n\nVogue\n\nWintour again introduced sweeping changes to Vogue from her first issue forward. Many of these changes could be seen right on the cover. Anna favored more naturalistic photography of lesser-known models outside, as opposed to the tight headshots the magazine had previously favored. Additionally, Wintour's first Vogue cover was also the first to feature a model wearing jeans, with the added bonus of wearing a bejeweled T-shirt valued at around $10,000.\n\nBy the 2000s, Anna had solidified her grasp on Vogue's artistic direction and had become a household name. The September 2004 issue was the largest issue of a monthly magazine ever published at that time, sitting at a whopping 832 pages. Wintour oversaw the introduction of three magazine spinoffs: Teen Vogue, Vogue Living, and Men's Vogue. Teen Vogue has gone on to become an extremely popular entity, earning more advertiser revenue than either Elle Girl or Cosmo Girl.\n\nIn 2003, Lauren Weisberger, Anna's former assistant, published the book \"The Devil Wears Prada.\" The book's main character, Miranda Priestly, was believed by many to have been based on Wintour. A film adaptation was released in 2006 starring Meryl Streep as Miranda and Anne Hathaway as \"Andrea Sachs,\" the fictional assistant. Perhaps unintentionally, the movie transformed Anna's image into a cultural icon versus just a public figure.\n\nRumors began to fly in 2008 that Wintour had lost her touch and was set to retire, but she disputed that rumor during a \"60 Minutes\" profile. In 2013, Cond\u00e9 Nast announced that Anna would be taking the position of artistic director while still remaining at Vogue. In 2014, the Metropolitan Museum of Art named its Costume Institute complex after Wintour, with First Lady Michelle Obama presiding over the opening. In May 2017, Wintour was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace for her contributions to fashion journalism.\n\nIn June 2025, after 37 years at the helm of American Vogue, Wintour stepped down from the editor-in-chief role. However, she retained her positions as Cond\u00e9 Nast's global chief content officer and global editorial director of Vogue, continuing to influence the company's broader editorial vision. The move marked a transition away from daily editorial operations, allowing her to focus on Cond\u00e9 Nast's wider portfolio, including titles like Vanity Fair, Glamour, Allure, and GQ.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nAnna Wintour was married to renowned child psychiatrist Dr. David Shaffer from 1984 until their divorce in 1999. The couple had two children together: Charles, born in 1985, and Katherine, born in 1987. Katherine\u2014who goes by \"Bee\"\u2014briefly entered the media world, writing columns for The Daily Telegraph in 2006, but has publicly stated she has no interest in pursuing a career in fashion. Instead, she attended Columbia University and later worked in political communications.\n\nIn 2004, Wintour began a relationship with telecommunications executive Shelby Bryan, a high-profile investor and one-time Democratic fundraiser. Their relationship became the subject of media scrutiny due to its overlap with Bryan's divorce from his former wife, but Wintour remained typically private about her personal affairs. As of the mid-2020s, it has been reported that the couple has separated, though neither party has commented publicly.\n\nWintour is famously disciplined and reserved in her personal habits, maintaining a rigid routine that includes waking up before 6 a.m., playing tennis daily, and attending high-profile fashion events in the evenings. Despite her reputation for being icy or aloof\u2014a persona popularized by The Devil Wears Prada\u2014many who know her describe her as deeply loyal and fiercely supportive of her inner circle.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nAnna Wintour has long leveraged her influence in the fashion world to support a wide range of philanthropic causes. She serves as a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where she has played a central role in organizing the museum's annual Costume Institute Gala\u2014commonly known as the Met Gala. Under her stewardship, the event has become one of the most high-profile fundraisers in the world, raising more than $50 million for the museum's Costume Institute.\n\nIn 2003, Wintour spearheaded the creation of the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund, a joint initiative between Vogue and the Council of Fashion Designers of America. The fund provides financial support and mentorship to emerging American designers and has helped launch the careers of now-prominent names like Alexander Wang, Joseph Altuzarra, and Proenza Schouler.\n\nWintour has also been a significant force in the fight against HIV/AIDS. Since the early 1990s, she has helped raise more than $10 million for AIDS-related charities, including amfAR (The Foundation for AIDS Research) and the New York AIDS Film Festival. In addition to her fundraising work, she has used the pages of Vogue to promote awareness and reduce stigma, commissioning fashion editorials and features that spotlight the issue.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 1992, Anna paid $1.4 million for a townhouse in NYC's Greenwich Village neighborhood. This landmarked 5-bed, 4-bath home in the MacDougal\u2011Sullivan Gardens district is now valued at approximately $10 million.\n\nIn 1998, she bought an estate in the Long Island town of Mastic. She subsequently bought several neighboring properties to bring her footprint to 42 acres. Today, this property is likely worth $10-15 million.", "images": ["https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/1JoH3482haSLevnlEMdqhrz36y0=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/11/George-Clooney.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/I4dSiTJhq0kprSuO--deoPCEAmQ=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/06/taylor.png", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/uRsxoLs7Ymmit5ATgRtN2utad40=/221x5:381x236/132x132/filters:format(webp):strip_exif()/2009/09/P-Diddy.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/OQuNA2qznl5cjbDT-T05q1LsSWA=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2017/09/Graydon-Carter.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/281qjnyUi0N9uax1bkJONcA5LvI=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/11/shelby-bryan.png", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/themes/cnw_2023/svg/logo.svg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/0dOqT2nlNQM7u_J-5xWrCsf2nAw=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/02/Angelina-Jolie.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/_hOmdPz8Ht24ZxIeZM7m4mGRouk=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/11/GettyImages-1094653148.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/Y14fttV9jls9mxFLuNAHJTnNWTE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/10/denzel-washington-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/yboGsO77E1kQwELLmrwRZv_4RmE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2017/02/GettyImages-528215436.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/tckl6bYSVHJii6SRP4LQ8iQrOec=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2014/01/nat.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/GCy_CmtQ6D3cffhE_NV5apzux8s=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2018/07/pat2.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/kJurcAlYxhfwPm06Laezkf6NLGM=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2011/06/Karl-Lagerfeld.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/aw2.jpg?x46379", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/IoWqGPmFDjvC6iTqcDsspXBuxqo=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2018/03/GettyImages-821622848.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/IvmzAUIORjuMmegjTR-B80Ds9l8=/600x300/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2010/03/aw2.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/lY3-oCS-xIdiqDaOi1qHd6UaTjg=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/09/Cristiano-Ronaldo.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/95i5RI1LWkjHyyoolMeto-z_WeU=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/01/lopez3.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/KFAqJ9F4o80l6an2fe78-0jw28s=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/04/rr.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript"], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/aw2.jpg?x46379", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/richest-designers/anna-wintour-net-worth/", "title": "Anna Wintour Net Worth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Anna Wintour is an American magazine editor and fashion news icon who has a net worth of $50 million.
