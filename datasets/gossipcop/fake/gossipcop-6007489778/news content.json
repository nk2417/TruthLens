Scott (real name Jacques Webster) pleaded guilty to the lowest charge and was required to pay $640 in court-associated costs, in addition to $6,825.31 to two people who said they were injured at the concert. The other two misdemeanor charges \u2014 inciting a riot and endangering the welfare of a child \u2014 were dismissed.\n\n\u201cObviously, [Scott] would not in any way want a riot to break out at his concert. That would not be good for him as an entertainer,\u201d Nelson says. \u201cTo think that he incited one is ridiculous. We think the police way overcharged him. The prosecutor\u2019s office finally did the right thing \u2014 they made an offer that he agreed to. \u2026 If anyone was hurt, Travis expressed concern from the beginning. He wanted to make sure those people were taken care of.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars at Court Chris Brown isn't the only celeb who has faced a judge. See more stars in court such as Taylor Swift, Lindsay Lohan and more.\n\nThe attorney added that he believes the disorderly conduct charge could eventually be expunged from Scott\u2019s record.\n\nThe Rogers Police Department told Us at the time of the arrest that the \u201cGoosebumps\u201d rapper \u201cencouraged people to rush the stage and bypass the security protocols to ensure concertgoer safety.\u201d He was taken into custody at the Benton County Jail and released later in the evening.\n\nRelated: Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott: A Timeline of Their Relationship See a timeline of Kylie Jenner's relationship with boyfriend Travis Scott, with whom she\u2019s expecting her first child \u2014 see the pics\n\nThe news of Scott\u2019s guilty plea comes just a few days after he became a father with girlfriend Kylie Jenner, who gave birth to the couple\u2019s daughter, Stormi, on Thursday, February 1. A source exclusively told Us that the 20-year-old reality star is \u201cloving starting a family\u201d with Scott, whom she began dating in April 2017.", "images":
