In an announcement on Twitter she posted, \u201cI\u2019m so bummed I won\u2019t be able to make it to China this year. Love my VS family, and will be with all my girls in spirit!! Can't wait to tune in with everyone to see the beautiful show I know it will be, and already can't wait for next year!\u201d\n\nUp until Thursday, it was understood that Gigi would be joining her sister and walking the show for the third year in a row. The abrupt announcement has many fans speculating as to why she will not be there. While some have cited other models having issues with Visa\u2019s, the majority feel that it might have something to do with a viral video of her that was posted to Snapchat a few months ago. In the video, Gigi is shown squinting her eyes while holding a Buddha, which was seen as extremely offensive. With the show taking place in Shanghai, commenters called for the model to drop out almost immediately after news broke that she was joining the 2017 model cast. Despite a written apology several months after the incident, it appears several fans were still held a grudge.", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68fba7f7daf24cf1ce68ee50/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo.svg", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a0f058eb4343143899d749f/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-499470100.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a0e003411600633d888ecaf/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-626763560.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68fceec7daf24cf1ce68ee66/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68f66ac930197853ea8fa94a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68fcecb5a946b8405aff653c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/635aa80d834ef77a3d05ce8e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a0a475f1d555b48d196927d/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-873804114.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/654d226748d5b8e1df8fa204/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6904c171934452742846a6d4/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a0f081cb4343143899d74a1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gigi-hadid-vs-fb.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/67dd51619d07f017918d6063/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6894890bb0414fdff135dbc0/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68fa3921d42a2cf2f237c104/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a0cac60fd22840b1b29406a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-874564648.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a0f081cb4343143899d74a1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gigi-hadid-vs-fb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Hardy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/gigi-hadid-victorias-secret-fashion-show-quit-china-ban-internet-reactions", "title": "Gigi Hadid Pulled Out of the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, and the Internet Has Opinions", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Alyssa Hardy", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Gigi Hadid announced she will not be walking in the 2017 VS Fashion Show, and reactions have been varied with people celebrating, demanding an explanation, and even threatening to boycott Victoria's Secret.", "id": "5a0ee106112b434d3af5ac58", "keywords": "gigi hadid,victoria's secret,vs fashion show,victoria's secret fashion show", "news_keywords": "gigi hadid,victoria's secret,vs fashion show,victoria's secret fashion show", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a0ee106112b434d3af5ac58", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Gigi Hadid announced she will not be walking in the 2017 VS Fashion Show, and reactions have been varied with people celebrating, demanding an explanation, and even threatening to boycott Victoria's Secret.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a0f0588b4343143899d749d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-496562196.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a0f0588b4343143899d749d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-496562196.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\"May this be a lesson for her.\"", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a0f081cb4343143899d74a1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gigi-hadid-vs-fb.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Why Some People Are Celebrating Gigi Hadid Missing the 2017 VS Fashion Show", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/gigi-hadid-victorias-secret-fashion-show-quit-china-ban-internet-reactions"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-11-17T16:04:46.858Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-17T16:04:46.858Z", "author": "Alyssa Hardy"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "\"May this be a lesson for her.\"", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a0f081cb4343143899d74a1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gigi-hadid-vs-fb.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Why Some People Are Celebrating Gigi Hadid Missing the 2017 VS Fashion Show"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a0f081cb4343143899d74a1/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/gigi-hadid-vs-fb.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510934686.858, "source": "http://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
