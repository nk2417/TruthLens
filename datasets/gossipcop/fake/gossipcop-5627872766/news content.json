During a panel at last month\u2019s San Diego Comic-Con, Theron addressed the possibility of reuniting with Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins \u2013 who previously teamed up with the actress in Monster.\n\n\u201cLook I would love to work with her again.\u201d Theron revealed. \u201cI had such an incredible time. I trusted her from the first time I met her. That\u2019s a big thing for an actor, to be able to trust your director that way and she just never disappointed. She\u2019s incredible so to see her have this moment, I just feel incredibly happy for her.\u201d\n\nConsidering the success of 2003\u2019s Monster \u2013 which earned Theron a Best Actress Oscar \u2013 a reunion between the two in Wonder Woman 2 feels like a no-brainer. While nothing is currently confirmed, Jenkins appears to agree, judging by a letter Theron was given at the SDCC panel.\n\n\u201cGetting to work with Charlize and what we did together will always be remembered as a great high point of my life.\u201d Jenkins explained. \u201cShe\u2019s a tremendous person, talent, artist, and actor, but also a wonderful and incredibly unique spirit who brings that dynamism to every part she plays. She\u2019s hard, yet soft, tough, yet yielding. It was a wonderful and rare gift and I can\u2019t wait to work with my friend again one day.\u201d\n\nUltimately, time will tell if Theron is officially cast in Wonder Woman 2. But it\u2019s definitely worth noting that both she and Jenkins are on board with the idea.\n\nWonder Woman has an 86.52 ComicBook.com Composite Score and a 4.33 out of 5 ComicBook.com User Rating, making it the fourth-highest ranked comic book movie of all time among ComicBook.com readers.
