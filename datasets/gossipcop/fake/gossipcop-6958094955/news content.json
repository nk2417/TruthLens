The suit resulted from a Nov. 8 article that quoted former actor Dominick Brascia as saying Haim told him that Sheen and Haim \u201csmoked pot and had sex. He said they had anal sex. Haim said after it happened Sheen became very cold and rejected him. When Corey wanted to fool around again, Charlie was not interested.\u201d\n\nIn a statement released by his attorney, Shane Bernard, after the complaint was filed, Sheen said, \u201cIn my nearly 35 years as a celebrated entertainer, I have been nothing shy of a forthright, noble and valiant courier of the truth.\u201d\n\nSheen continued, \u201cConsistently admitting and owning a laundry list of shortcomings, wrongdoings and indiscretions this traveler hath traveled \u2014 however, every man has a breaking point. These radically groundless and unfounded allegations end now. I now take a passionate stand against those who wish to even entertain the sick and twisted lies against me. GAME OVER.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sheen.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5x4_082025_COVER.jpg?fit=240%2C300&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sheen.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tim Kenneally", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid", "Border-Radius Box-Shadow Rgba", "Rgba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/charlie-sheen-settles-lawsuit-against-national-enquirer-over-corey-haim-rape-report/", "title": "Charlie Sheen Settles Lawsuit Against National Enquirer Over Corey Haim Rape Report", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Charlie Sheen Settles Lawsuit Against National Enquirer Over Corey Haim Rape Report", "description": "A spokesman for the publisher says that the matter has been \"amicably resolved\"", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/charlie-sheen-settles-lawsuit-against-national-enquirer-over-corey-haim-rape-report/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Sheen.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "http://facebook.com/thewrap", "published_time": "2018-03-19T17:28:30+00:00"}, "author": "Tim Kenneally", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Tim Kenneally", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "charlie_sheen, charlie_sheen_lawsuit, corey_haim, dominick-brascia, national_enquirer", "article-section": "media", "article-categories": "culture, lawsuits-2, media, movies", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521480510.0, "source": "http://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
