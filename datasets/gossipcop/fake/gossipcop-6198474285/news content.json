This is our responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump continues to dominate the s\u2014\u2014- president ever competition,\u201d Legend, 38, wrote.\n\nTrump\u2019s loudest critic was Pulitzer Prize winner and Hamilton creator Miranda \u2014 whose father, Luis A. Miranda, Jr., moved to New York as a teenager from Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going straight to hell, @realDonaldTrump. No long lines for you. Someone will say, \u2018Right this way, sir.\u2019 They\u2019ll clear a path,\u201d Miranda, 37, wrote, standing up for Cruz. \u201cShe has been working 24/7. You have been GOLFING. You\u2019re going straight to hell. Fastest golf cart you ever took.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you tweet this one from the first hole, 18th hole, or the club?\u201d he added. \u201cAnyway, it\u2019s a lie. You\u2019re a congenital liar.\u201d\n\nHurricane Maria pummeled Puerto Rico on Sept. 20 with ferocious 155-mph winds that ripped trees from the ground, tore roofs from buildings, and caused flooding that made many streets look like raging rivers. The most powerful storm of its kind to hit the island since 1932, it ravaged the island and left millions homeless.\n\nElectricity has been knocked out completely, with residents in need of electricity having to rely on backup generators. Experts estimate it could take half a year to restore power to the 3.5 million people who live there. Cell phone service has also been completely shut down.\n\nThe storm has claimed at least 16 lives in Puerto Rico so far, the Associated Press reports. Experts estimate that without electricity and supplies, that number could increase to thousands.\n\nRIO GRANDE, PUERTO RICO - SEPTEMBER 27, 2017: Heydee Perez, age 29, and her son, Yenel Calera, age 4 have not received any aid one week after Hurricane Maria.

During a speech on his tax plan in Washington, D.C. on Friday, the president said the disaster relief effort has been complicated because the island is \u201csurrounded by water.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is an island, surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz, who is a member of the island\u2019s Popular Democratic party and has been on the ground helping citizens, blasted FEMA in a press conference Friday, after receiving only \u201c4 palates of water, 3 palates of meals, and 12 palates of infant food\u201d from them.\n\n\u201cWe are dying here. And I cannot fathom the thought that the greatest nation of the world cannot figure out logistics for a small island of 100 miles by 35 miles long,\u201d she said in a press conference, The Washington Post reported. \u201cI am begging anyone that can hear us to save us from dying. If anybody out there is listening to us, we are dying and you are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nTHAIS LLORCA/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cI am done being polite, I am done being politically correct. I am mad as hell because my people\u2019s lives are at stake. And we are but one nation,\u201d she added. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get the food into people\u2019s hands, what we are going to see is something close to a genocide.\u201d\n\nShe also specifically criticized Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke for referring to U.S. response to the struggling Puerto Rico as a \u201cgood news story.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe from where she\u2019s standing it\u2019s a good news story,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re drinking from a creek, it\u2019s not a good news story. When you don\u2019t have food for a baby, it\u2019s not a good news story.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Watch: Natasha Stoynoff Breaks Silence, Accuses Donald Trump of Sexual Attack\n\nIn response, Trump said Cruz\u2019s critiques were politically driven.\n\n\u201cThe Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,\u201d he tweeted, before once again taking aim at the media.\n\n\u201cThe Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first Rs!\u201d he wrote. \u201cShame!\u201d\n\nDaniel Scavino, Jr., the White House Director of Social Media, also started slamming Cruz, calling her a \u201cTrump hater.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Mayor of San Juan is the perfect example of an opportunistic politician. Go ask PR Gov about responsiveness,\u201d Scavino, Jr. wrote \u2014 digging up a pre-election tweet of Cruz\u2019s in which she said, in Spanish, that she doesn\u2019t think Trump deserves to be president. \u201cSan Juan, PR Mayor has been hating on @realDonaldTrump long before he was our President. I\u2019m not surprised by the show she is putting on\u2026\u201d\n\nAt least one user shot back at Scavino, Jr.\u2019s claims. \u201cSo the average American can expect mockery from our government during a crisis if our mayor doesn\u2019t like Trump?\u201d she asked.", "images":
