And it\u2019s fair to say they certainly may not view Meghan\u2019s as ideal.\u201d\n\nThe couple look really happy to us! Go Meghan!", "images": ["https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/15394/17-09-14-meghan-markle-prince-harry-prev-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/chrissie-swan-the-shortcut-queen-691e509abfe28.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-20t164344.876-691eaa9997406.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-13t111849.371-691523f39f6e6.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/131299/kate-middleton-style-1.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/04/New-Header-2.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/Logo-1.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/untitled-design-2025-11-13t155101.395-691563c9075e3.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/131095/untitled-design-2023-11-08t103411331.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/icon-phosphor-circle.svg", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/07/NIFLOGO_Organge.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-18t171832.263-691c0fd21ad3d.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/ni2546pm1_marketing-cover_v0.1-691a9098143bf-scaled.jpg?resize=1955%2C2560", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/air-fryer-1-691eadfe53bed.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920-x-1080-11-6916b87c8e3c7.png?resize=380%2C200", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?d=mm&s=128", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/15394/17-09-14-meghan-markle-prince-harry-prev-scaled.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-20t100612.179-691e4d7618296.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-14t092603.688-69165b0bdf11b.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/untitled-design-43-691557d7aea0d.jpg?resize=380%2C285"], "top_img": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/15394/17-09-14-meghan-markle-prince-harry-prev-scaled.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patricia Smails"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newidea.com.au/royals/meghan-markle-has-a-secret-boyfriend-that-prince-harry-doesnt-know-about/", "title": "US report: Meghan Markle has a \u2018secret boyfriend\u2019 that Prince Harry doesn\u2019t know about", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "taboola-author": "Patricia Smails", "taboola-category": "ROYALS", "taboola-section": "royals", "taboola-pub-date": "2017-08-18T10:10:38+10:00", "taboola-updated-date": "2024-05-11T11:05:45+10:00", "taboola-title": "US report: Meghan Markle has a \u2018secret boyfriend\u2019 that Prince Harry doesn\u2019t know about", "taboola-description": "<p>The royal-to-be is the subject of a sensational report our of the US</p>", "taboola-image-url": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/15394/17-09-14-meghan-markle-prince-harry-prev-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1365", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The royal-to-be is the subject of a sensational report out of the United States today -
