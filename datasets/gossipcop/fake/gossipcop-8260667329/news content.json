And I am happy. And I say that so plainly because, well\u2026it takes time. To be happy. To figure out how to be kind to yourself. To not just choose that happiness, but to feel it.\n\n\"My 20s were brutal \u2013 a constant battle with myself, judging my weight, my style, my desire to be as cool/as hip/as smart/as \"whatever\" as everyone else. My teens were even worse \u2013 grappling with how to fit in, and what that even meant.\n\nView 6 Images Happy birthday Meghan!

We\u2019re in love.\n\n\"I\u2019m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It\u2019s part of what makes it so special, that it\u2019s just ours. But we\u2019re happy. Personally, I love a great love story.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nOn the proposal\n\nView 6 Images The pair got married earlier this year (Image: Getty)\n\nIn Meghan and Harry's first interview post-engagement, she told the BBC about how the proposal happened.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\"Just a cosy night. What were we doing? We were trying to roast a chicken. It was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got down on one knee. . . As a matter of fact, I could barely let [him] finish proposing, like, 'Can I say yes now?!'\"\n\nOn feminism\n\nIn her speech at the UN in 2015, Meghan told the story of her 11-year-old self who was angry at a sexist TV ad - and how she felt compelled to do something about it:\n\n\"I had been in school watching a TV show in elementary school and this commercial came on with the tag line for this dish washing liquid and the tag line said, \u2018Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans\u2019.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\"Two boys from my class said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s where women belong, in the kitchen\u2019.\n\n\"I remember feeling shocked and angry and also just feeling so hurt; it just wasn't right, and something needed to be done. So I went home and told my dad what had happened, and he encouraged me to write letters, so I did, to the most powerful people I could think of.\"\n\n\"It is said that girls with dreams become women with vision. May we empower each other to carry out such vision \u2014 because it isn't enough to simply talk about equality. One must believe it. And it isn't enough to simply believe in it. One must work at it. Let us work at it. Together.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nOn her humanitarian work\n\nView 6 Images Meghan visited Rwanda as part of her outreach work (Image: PA)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nIn 2016, Meghan wrote on The Tig about how she feels she can't not do humanitarian work - particularly with the responsibility of someone in the entertainment industry who is looked up to.\n\n\"I\u2019ve never wanted to be a lady who lunches \u2013 I\u2019ve always wanted to be a woman who works. And this type of work is what feeds my soul, and fuels my purpose.\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\nOn the Queen\n\nView 6 Images It seems as if they get on like a house on fire (Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\nIn the royal couple's engagement interview on the BBC in November 2017, Meghan spoke about how she has the utmost respect for Harry's grandmother.\n\n\"To be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honor and respect for her as the monarch, but the love that he has for her as his grandmother\u2026 all of those layers have been so important for me so that when I met her, I had such a deep understanding and of course incredible respect for being able to have that time with her \u2026 She's an incredible woman.\"", "images": ["http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/trust-project.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12567040.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/xMAIN-Prince-Harry-Marries-Ms-Meghan-Markle-Procession.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12489805.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/MAIN-Prince-Harry-visit-to-Cardiff-Castle11.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12704731.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/The-Duchess-Of-Sussex-Undertakes-Her-First-Official-Engagement-With-Queen-Elizabeth-II.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11619786.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Prince-Harry-Meghan-Markle-Visit-Nottingham.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12707136.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/2_The-Duchess-Of-Sussex-Undertakes-Her-First-Official-Engagement-With-Queen-Elizabeth-II.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11975385.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Prince-Harry-engagement.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13701121.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/0_THP_CHP_071218SLUG_0158JPG.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/nav-web-static/release-v41-14493b7c888038a7d89b99cb3a7937c2b71eaebe/public/logo-reach.png", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12769318.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/MAIN-Why-Meghan-always-wears-shoes.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12707136.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_The-Duchess-Of-Sussex-Undertakes-Her-First-Official-Engagement-With-Queen-Elizabeth-II.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13740607.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/0_MAIN-Prince-Harry-Meghan-Markle.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/ipso.svg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/assets/mirror/logos/masthead-mirror-default.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13019990.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Meghan-Markle-Insta-6.png"], "top_img": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12707136.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_The-Duchess-Of-Sussex-Undertakes-Her-First-Official-Engagement-With-Queen-Elizabeth-II.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robyn Darbyshire", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/meghan-markle-words-what-duchess-13021814", "title": "what the Duchess thinks about love, work and happiness", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"page_id": 6149699161, "app_id": 123792601022133, "pages": 1814357575554395}, "description": "These quotes from Meghan Markle throughout her career show that she was born to be a princess", "author": "Robyn Darbyshire", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "Googlebot-News": "noarchive", "referrer": "unsafe-URL", "keywords": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, Royal Family", "news_keywords": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, Royal Family", "allowTaboolaDeepDive": "true", "vf": {"00000000-0000-4000-8000-67e599051dc3": "mirror-prod-13021814"}, "og": {"title": "Meghan Markle in her own words - what she thinks about love, work and happiness", "description": "These quotes from Meghan Markle throughout her career show that she was born to be a princess", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/meghan-markle-words-what-duchess-13021814", "site_name": "Daily Mirror", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12707136.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_The-Duchess-Of-Sussex-Undertakes-Her-First-Official-Engagement-With-Queen-Elizabeth-II.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-08-03T11:55:44Z", "modified_time": "2018-08-04T14:22:39Z", "author": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/robyn-darbyshire/", "section": "UK News", "tag": "Royal Family"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@DailyMirror", "creator": "@DailyMirror", "title": "Meghan Markle in her own words - what the Duchess thinks about love, work and happiness - The Mirror", "description": "These quotes from Meghan Markle throughout her career show that she was born to be a princess", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12707136.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_The-Duchess-Of-Sussex-Undertakes-Her-First-Official-Engagement-With-Queen-Elizabeth-II.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533297344.0, "source": "http://www.mirror.co.uk", "summary": ""}
