At the time of 10:09am the royal purification ceremony begins. Wearing a white robe, the king will enter a pavilion at the Grand Palace, where he will be doused in sacred water from five rivers and four ponds in Thailand. In the distant past water was collected from specific rivers in India, reflecting the influential blend of Hindu and Buddhist cosmology on the coronation. Hindu Brahmins and the country's most senior Buddhist monks will be present. Coronation practices can be traced back thousands of years to ancient India.\n\nThe crown\n\nNot long after royal purification rites, the king proceeds to the Baisal Daksin Throne Hall where he receives sacred water from eight directions. Symbolically that means he has received legitimacy from all directions of the kingdom. He ascends the Bhadrapitha Throne, where in regal robes he sits under a Nine-Tiered Umbrella of State. Brahmins will hand the monarch the royal regalia, including a wooden sceptre inlaid with gold, a precious stone-encrusted sword believed to have been found in a lake in northern Cambodia, slippers, and a whisk made from yak's hair.\n\nThe Great Crown of Victory is the centrepiece. Tiered, gold and weighing 7.3 kilograms, it has a diamond from India at the top. Vajiralongkorn will personally place the crown on his own head and then issues his first royal command.\n\nThe audience\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the newly-crowned king is set to grant a \"grand audience\" to members of the royal family, the privy council, the cabinet and senior officials. Two hours later the king will visit the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, the most sacred space in Thailand, which on normal days is thronged with tourists. He then symbolically moves into the Royal Residence.\n\nThe procession\n\nThe main element of Sunday's ceremonies, streets across Bangkok's historic heart have been blocked off in preparation for this moment. The king will sit on a royal palanquin carried by soldiers dressed in colourful traditional garb. A 21-gun salute will start the procession. Some 200,000 people are expected to line the seven-kilometre route around the city.\n\nMeet the people\n\nOn the last day of the ceremony Rama X will appear on the balcony of Suddhaisavarya Prasad Hall in the Grand Palace at 4:30pm \"to receive the good wishes of the people\". An hour later, diplomats will be given an audience at the Grand Palace. This is the only time during the ceremony that representatives of foreign governments will greet the king.", "images": ["https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/S5CPOYBKNVXVBJQUFXM5SXGCJM.jpg?smart=true&auth=233c8be49b3b349949f109107908985d594736a9a0865cfa4689e4a908bef06f&width=1200&height=630", "https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/S5CPOYBKNVXVBJQUFXM5SXGCJM.jpg?smart=true&auth=233c8be49b3b349949f109107908985d594736a9a0865cfa4689e4a908bef06f&width=400&height=225", "https://www.thenationalnews.com/pf/resources/images/ipso_black.svg?d=1057", "http://www.thenational.ae/pf/resources/images/logo.webp?d=1057"], "top_img": "https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/S5CPOYBKNVXVBJQUFXM5SXGCJM.jpg?smart=true&auth=233c8be49b3b349949f109107908985d594736a9a0865cfa4689e4a908bef06f&width=1200&height=630", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thenationalnews.com/arts-culture/film/speculation-that-jennifer-lawrence-to-blame-for-faris-pratt-split-1.617843", "title": "Speculation that Jennifer Lawrence to blame for Faris Pratt split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover, user-scalable=no", "description": "Despite there being no suggestion that Lawrence had any involvement in the split social media users have taken against her", "og": {"description": "Despite there being no suggestion that Lawrence had any involvement in the split social media users have taken against her", "site_name": "The National", "title": "Speculation that Jennifer Lawrence to blame for Faris Pratt split | The National", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thenationalnews.com/resizer/v2/S5CPOYBKNVXVBJQUFXM5SXGCJM.jpg?smart=true&auth=233c8be49b3b349949f109107908985d594736a9a0865cfa4689e4a908bef06f&width=1200&height=630", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Chris Pratt's co-star in Passengers, Jennifer Lawrence, is bearing the brunt of the blame for the actor's marriage split on social media.
