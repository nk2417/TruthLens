{"url": "people.com/pets/amanda-seyfried-introducing-dog-finn-to-baby-girl/", "text": "Long before she became a mom to her baby girl with husband Thomas Sadoski, Amanda Seyfried was a pet parent.\n\nThe Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again star adopted her beloved dog Finn from Best Friends Animal Society. The pair have been an \u201cit couple\u201d in the pet world, working to raise awareness about all the shelter animals in need of loving homes.\n\nThe 8-year-old rescue pooch and his famous mom, 32, have done so much good for animals in need that Seyfried was recently recognized at the Best Friends Animal Society\u2019s 3rd Annual New York City Gala to Save Them All. The actress received the save them all spotlight award at the Gala on Tuesday in recognition of her work toward making America no-kill across all its animal shelters by 2025.\n\nBen Gabbe/Getty\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s sad he couldn\u2019t be here tonight but I didn\u2019t think it was a good idea to drag him across the country just for one evening,\u201d Seyfried told PEOPLE at the event about why her canine companion wasn\u2019t by her side to accept award.\n\nFinn was back at home on the west coast for the big night hanging out with his new baby sister. Seyfried, who welcomed her first child in March 2017, said that her daughter and Finn get along great now, but that \u201cit\u2019s definitely a little stressful introducing a baby into this relationship, this dynamic, that I have with him.\u201d\n\nTo make this transition as easy as possible for the entire family, the actress followed some \u201creally good advice\u201d she got from a friend.\n\n\u201cYou just take the hat home from the hospital, the one that they put on the baby after it\u2019s born, and then you bring the hat home for like a day or two before the baby comes home and you just leave it by the dog and let him sniff it,\u201d Seyfried said of the tip. \u201cIt was the best we could do. It was hard. It\u2019s an interesting transition for everybody but it worked.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Amanda Seyfried and Thomas Sadoski Welcome First Child\n\nNow, over a year after Seyfried brought that hat, and the little girl who wore it, home, the entire Sadoski-Seyfried family is comfortable with one another and getting closer every day.\n\n\u201cHe still won\u2019t play with her, which is absolutely fine because he\u2019s big and she\u2019s tiny,\u201d Seyfried said of Finn and her daughter\u2019s relationship. \u201cWe taught her \u2018gentle\u2019 since she was born and she always goes over and pats him, and she looks over at us, and pats him more. And he lets her and sometimes he rolls over.\u201d\n\nPaul Zimmerman/WireImage\n\nIt\u2019s these literal baby steps toward forming a bond that Seyfried is working towards teaching her child.\n\nCan\u2019t get enough of cats, dogs and other furry friends? Click here to get the cutest pet news and photos delivered directly to your inbox.\n\n\u201cIf you teach children to be gentle with these animals, they\u2019re not going to feel so protective and intimidated. Because it\u2019s something that is unpredictable, so it\u2019s a good way to have a safe give and take.\u201d\n\nSeyfried\u2019s little girl will likely be around plenty of animals as she grows up, since here mom, who was \u201chumbled\u201d by the recent honor, said she spends a lot of time advocating for pets in need.", "images":
