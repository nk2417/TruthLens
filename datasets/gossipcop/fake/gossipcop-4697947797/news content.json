Eric Swalwell\u2019s town hall at Livermore high school\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell (D-Dublin) (Jazmine Ulloa / Los Angeles Times)\n\nOver the shouts of a lone heckler at a packed Livermore town hall, Northern California Rep. Eric Swalwell on Saturday once more called for the creation of an independent commission to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cIf we do anything, we should make sure that the 2018 election is more secure than the 2016 election,\u201d Swalwell said, drawing a round of applause from the audience.\n\nRoughly 500 people filled the seats at a Granada High School gym, many of whom were attending a town hall for the first time amid concerns over what they said they view as a tense and divisive political climate in Washington. The event was organized to address questions from constituents about jobs, healthcare and what Swalwell called efforts to protect democracy.\n\nQuite the crowd at Granada High in Livermore for @RepSwalwell's town hall. Lots of hands went up when asked who's here for the first time. pic.twitter.com/8gyfX6RHWi \u2014 Jazmine Ulloa (@jazmineulloa) August 5, 2017\n\nIt came days after special counsel Robert S. Mueller III convened a criminal grand jury to investigate the presidential election, focusing on Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s meeting with a Russian lawyer who promised damaging information about Hillary Clinton.\n\nQuestions over the Russia probe and GOP efforts to kill the Affordable Care Act dominated the discussion.\n\nSwalwell, a Democrat from Dublin who serves on the House Intelligence Committee, has started a web page detailing the alleged Russian ties of Trump administration officials. He said Mueller\u2019s investigation did not eliminate the need for an independent commission.\n\nThe congressman said there was no evidence Russian actors had changed votes. But intelligence reports had shown President Vladimir Putin influenced the election through \u201ca multifaceted attack\u201d that he said included hacked emails and the spread of fake news through social media trolls.\n\n\u201cWhat we know the Russians did do is that they went into a number of state election voter databases,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know why. You could speculate that they wanted to show that they could at least get in, and that it would sow discord or sow doubt when the result came out.\u201d\n\nThe event was largely free of the protests and rambunctious tactics that have overtaken recent town halls in California. One man in the audience shouted questions at Swalwell as he spoke about Russian interference, yelling, \u201cGet over it. He won.\u201d But he was soon silenced by the audience.\n\nSwalwell also fielded questions about his efforts to ease college debt and build the Future Forum, a group of young Democratic members of Congress focused on student loan debt and homeownership.\n\nOn healthcare, Swalwell called for a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system, saying lawmakers needed to continue to expand access and reduce costs. Constituents quizzed him on who would pay for such a plan.", "images":
