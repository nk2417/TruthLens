The two \u201capparently had an argument of some sort while they were sitting in their seats.\u201d And while it\u2019s unclear what they disagreed on, it didn\u2019t seem to blow over, as \u201cshe got up and left and Nick went over to her manager and grabbed his kids,\u201d continued the insider. And Mariah didn\u2019t return to her seat!\n\nWhat the hell could Nick and Mariah POSSIBLY be beefing about, in front of their children, at the Kids\u2019 Choice Awards???\n\nThe obvious answer might seem to be the fugly orange outfits that Nick had Morrocan were rockin\u2019, but chances are it was something much deeper.\n\nBut was it really THAT bad that Nick had to take the kids away from a show that was for them?
