I have become a big audiobook person lately because real life is crazy and I desperately need my romance fixes!! This audiobook and narrator were spectacular, her voice totally nailed all the crazy personalities...it was SO MUCH FUN!! The story already is one of my favorites, then add the voice of the narrator and it makes the colorful characters and story even more enjoyable.\n\n\n\n5+++ STARS -- A non-stop, wild ride! Mystery Man was the land of BADASSES and the testosterone was overflowing everywhere, I would be surprised after reading this that I don't have hair on my chest. The story had an explosive romance and tons of action plus MAJOR BONUS! another gentle and perfect epilogue. I could see this one on the big screen - heck I could see many of KA books as movies.\n\n\n\nHawk, the hero, was Gwen's mystery man and she had been his booty call for a year and a half. He had said like 3 words to her at a restaurant, I think they were\"Are you coming?\" After that he would just show up in her bed give her lots of \"O's\" coupled with wild romps and then be gone in the morning. Gwen struggled with her conscience and this pattern, but in the end gave in to it even though this submissive behavior was so far from Gwen's spunky personality. Then Gwen is threatened and dragged into a big mess because of her trashy sister's illegal actions. Gwen marches into a biker shop that houses a very dangerous biker gang to find out where her sister is. She catches the eye of the gang leader who is HOT! then is interrogated by a police detective who is HOT! and then her midnight mystery man shows up (who is HOT!) to scold her. Once Hawk opens his mouth to tell her she has just created a big mess she decides she doesn't like his high handedness and they are over...he shouldn't have opened his mouth. Hawk laughs at her, loves the attitude that she gives him and realizes how much he has missed out of over the pass year and a half with not getting to know her. Such parody, it was hysterical.\n\n\n\nHawk was killer, beyond arrogant, I mean if there was a scale from 1 to 10 he would be like 100 and I mean arrogant not just confident. Enter Gwen, Hawk's perfect match, she didn't take his crap (except for the the first year and a half when he didn't open his mouth, at least for talking) At the beginning because Gwen had many other potential leading men, I wasn't even sure I wanted her with Hawk, but as the story progressed there was no questions. I actually think of all of KA alpha men that I have met so far Hawk would be their leader. Mystery Man also had so many other lovable characters from family to friends, a couple a different climaxes, some heart pounders, some heartbreakers--loved them all. I can't wait to read my next Kristen Ashley book!", "images":
