Honestly, she couldn\u2019t really care less what people think.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\"She believes that everyone is just jealous that she is able to get so skinny so fast and they are not!\"\n\nKylie Jenner sparks row over 'dangerous' waist trainers just WEEKS after giving birth READ MORE :\n\nView 3 Images Kylie sparked debate after promoting the waist trainer (Image: Instagram/kyliejenner)\n\nKylie has been inundated with comments from fans who believe she\u2019s risking her health by using a waist trainer to reclaim her shape.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nDismayed, one fan said: \"My God. Is Kylie still advertising waist trainers to teenage girls?\n\n\"How can u [sic] be so filthy rich and still sell out for something that is so dumb and could potentially perpetuate negative body image in young girls.\"\n\nAnother said: \"Find it so weird that the Kardashians/Jenners are multi millionaire uber cool influencers but still jam up their Instas with basic, basic ads.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\"Kylie, I\u2019m looking @ you with today's waist trainer.\"\n\nView 3 Images Kylie gave birth to Stormi less than two months ago (Image: Instagram/stormireacts)\n\nA fourth then quipped: \"Dear Kylie, your body is SUPPOSED to look like it does after giving birth.

Once you take the garment off, your body will return to its usual shape.\n\n\"It's also uncomfortable, restricts your movements, and if you wear it really tight, it can even make it difficult to breathe and theoretically could cause rib damage.\"", "images": ["http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/trust-project.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12217373.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Kylie-Jenner-reveals-her-slim-post-baby-figure-is-down-to-a-waist-trainer.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12217373.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Kylie-Jenner-reveals-her-slim-post-baby-figure-is-down-to-a-waist-trainer.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/nav-web-static/release-v41-14493b7c888038a7d89b99cb3a7937c2b71eaebe/public/logo-reach.png", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/ipso.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12232515.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Kylie-Jenner.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12190525.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/JFP_CHP_140318stormi_6265-JPG.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/assets/mirror/logos/masthead-mirror-default.svg"], "top_img": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12217373.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Kylie-Jenner-reveals-her-slim-post-baby-figure-is-down-to-a-waist-trainer.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kat Romero", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/kylie-jenner-says-everyone-jealous-12232494", "title": "Kylie Jenner sneers that 'everyone is jealous' of her post baby body after being slammed for promoting 'dangerous' waist trainers", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"page_id": 6149699161, "app_id": 123792601022133, "pages": 1814357575554395}, "description": "The new mum has slammed her critics", "author": "Kat Romero", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "Googlebot-News": "noarchive", "referrer": "unsafe-URL", "keywords": "Kylie Jenner", "news_keywords": "Kylie Jenner", "allowTaboolaDeepDive": "true", "vf": {"00000000-0000-4000-8000-67e599051dc3": "mirror-prod-12232494"}, "og": {"title": "Kylie Jenner says \u2018everyone is jealous\u2019 of her post baby body", "description": "The new mum has slammed her critics", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/kylie-jenner-says-everyone-jealous-12232494", "site_name": "Daily Mirror", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12217373.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Kylie-Jenner-reveals-her-slim-post-baby-figure-is-down-to-a-waist-trainer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-22T13:17:41Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-22T13:23:05Z", "author": "Kat Romero", "section": "Celebrity News", "tag": "Kylie Jenner"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@DailyMirror", "creator": "@KatMayRomero", "title": "Kylie Jenner sneers that 'everyone is jealous' of her post baby body after being slammed for promoting 'dangerous' waist trainers - The Mirror", "description": "The new mum has slammed her critics", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12217373.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Kylie-Jenner-reveals-her-slim-post-baby-figure-is-down-to-a-waist-trainer.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521724661.0, "source": "http://www.mirror.co.uk", "summary": ""}
