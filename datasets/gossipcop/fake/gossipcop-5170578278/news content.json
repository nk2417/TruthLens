John Shearer/ACMA2018/Getty\n\nShelton went on to say that neither of them were sure things would become serious, because they were both \u201ccoming out of a pretty low spot in our lives\u201d and were \u201ckind of clinging to each other to get through this.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut now here we are, going on three years later and every day that goes by it just feels like a stronger bond between the two of us and it constantly feels like it\u2019s going to the next level,\u201d he remarked.\n\nThe country singer previously hinted at their not-so-serious origins in September 2017, when he was joined by Stefani for an intimate concert at his Ole Red Tishomingo venue in Oklahoma.\n\nWhile jokingly discussing their relationship, Shelton explained they \u201cstarted hanging out together and messing around.\u201d\n\nAfter Stefani \u2014 who had brought along her three sons \u2014 appeared surprised by his admission, he added, \u201cyou know, texting each other.\u201d\n\nREX/Shutterstock\n\nThe former No Doubt frontwoman also addressed the beginning of their romance on her 2016 album This Is What the Truth Feels Like.\n\nOn \u201cTruth,\u201d she sings, \u201cAnd they\u2019re all gonna say I\u2019m rebounding, so rebound all over me.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Gwen Stefani and Her Kids Spend Spring Break in Blake Shelton\u2019s Native State of Oklahoma\n\nWhile discussing what the future holds for the pair, Shelton admitted to CMT\u2019s Cody Alan that while he is contemplating marriage, fans shouldn\u2019t be waiting on pins and needles for an engagement announcement.\n\n\u201cI think about it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anytime soon or anything,\u201d Shelton said when asked about walking down the aisle. \u201cThe more time that goes by, I guess, the closer you\u2019d be getting to that.\u201d\n\nSee Shelton\u2019s full interview Sunday, June 24th on Sunday TODAY.", "images":
