'I think ultimately we always want her to be happy, but it gets all clouded when there's a baby and, you know? Her motherly instincts kicked in and she has to do what makes her happy so we'll support that.'\n\nThe reality star also recalled the 'moment' her younger sister went into labour when they were filming KUWTK.\n\n'There was a moment where we were all flying to Cleveland when she went into labour and we were filming and [Kris] didn't want anyone to know she was in labour,' Kim continued.\n\n'So my mum just left and got on a plane and then Khlo\u00e9 called us. We were with a bunch of other people in this live interview that she didn't want to know. So she goes and gets on a plane and then me and my other sisters get on another plane and we were like, \"This is so stupid! We all need to be together and go through this!\" And it was like so much drama getting there.'\n\nKim first spoke out about allegations of Tristan's infidelity on The Ellen DeGeneres Show short after rumours hit the headlines, calling it 'so f*cked up'. As a result, the 27-year-old basketball player blocked Kim on Instagram but followed her again on Khlo\u00e9's birthday in June.\n\nIf you mess with one Kardashian, you mess with them all.", "images":
