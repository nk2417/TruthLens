The I Am Cait star, 68, has no plans to join season 26 of the show, despite reports saying otherwise.\n\nRelated: Caitlyn Jenner Through the Years Caitlyn Jenner, formerly Bruce Jenner, reintroduced herself with a gorgeous Vanity Fair July cover in June 2015 -- see photos of the reality star and former Olympic athlete through the years!\n\n\u201cThe current reports are not true,\u201d a rep for the reality star tells Us Weekly of the rumors. Although fans have been speculating for years that Jenner will join ABC\u2019s dancing competition series, it won\u2019t be happening in the near future.\n\nCheryl Burke, a former pro on the show, previously expressed interest in the Secrets of My Life author joining the cast. \u201cI think Caitlyn would be amazing on DWTS,\u201d Burke, 33, told Entertainment Tonight in June 2015. \u201cThe whole family has basically done it. I danced with Rob [Kardashian]. Kim [Kardashian] did it a few seasons ago.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019 Season 25 Cast: See Nick Lachey, Sasha Pieterse and More Celebs With Their Partners in Costume 'Dancing With the Stars' season 25 includes Nick Lachey, 'Pretty Little Liars' alum Sasha Pieterse and more \u2014 see the celebs with their partners in these costume pics!\n\nThe Dance Moms star added that Jenner should partner up with Val Chmerkovskiy, should she choose to do the show in the future. If she signed onto the series, Jenner would join a long list of Olympians who\u2019ve competed for the highly-coveted Mirrorball trophy, including Apolo Ohno, Simone Biles, Laurie Hernandez, Kristi Yamaguchi, Shawn Johnson, Charlie White, Evan Lysacek, Meryl Davis, Lolo Jones, Nastia Liukin and more!\n\nHowever, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star may soon be busy with other projects. Jenner revealed that she may run for office while speaking exclusively to Us Weekly in July 2017. \u201cYou never know, baby,\u201d she teased at the time. \u201cWound\u2019t be surprised.\u201d\n\nRelated: Dancing With the Stars Winners Through the Years: Mirrorball Champs From 2005 to Now See pictures of every Dancing With the Stars winner through the years, from Kelly Monaco in season one to Meryl Davis in season 18\n\nJenner first revealed her interest in a senatorial run during an interview with NYC\u2019s AM 970 earlier that month. \u201cThe political side of it has always been very intriguing to me,\u201d the lifelong Republican said. \u201cOver the next six months or so, I gotta find out where I can do a better job. Can I do a better job from the outside? \u2026 Or are you better from the inside? And we are in the process of determining that.\u201d", "images":
