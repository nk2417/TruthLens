Heading to Indio, California to take in Coachella this weekend, she left the flower crowns and body paint at home, showing up in looks direct from the catwalk. While the star has always had fun pushing the limits of festival dressing\u2014who can forget last year\u2019s epic Gucci bodysuit or the Matthew Adams Dolan deconstructed denim?\u2014this go round proved her most daring. Pulling out transparent Y/Project, custom Chrome Hearts, and a face-covering balaclava that rendered her almost incognito, she took style risks few others would attempt\u2014exactly what she and Fenty creative director Jahleel Weaver were going for. \u201cCoachella should always be fun and disruptive,\u201d shared Weaver via email. \u201cWe had such a moment last year with the Gucci crystal bodysuit and mask, so how do we top that?\u201d\n\nInstagram content\n\nUpping the ante meant entering the planning stage early. Though they started to officially brainstorm a month in advance, when Weaver and Rihanna saw a great piece during February\u2019s fashion month, they made a mental note. Case in point: the moment the balaclava turned up at Alessandro Michele\u2019s autumn/winter 2018 Gucci show, it was destined to be worn. \u201cRi and I both instantly loved it when it came down the runway,\u201d says Weaver. \u201cSo we started to think of what\u2019s the next opportunity to wear this? The Gucci team is so great to us and such a pleasure to work with and they made it happen.\u201d The love at first sight rule also applied to the gauzy Y/Project creation, which came with extreme UGGs that made it an outside the box choice: \u201cIt was just so NOT Coachella that it made us love the idea even more.\u201d", "images": ["http://www.vogue.co.uk/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/uk/logo.svg", "http://www.vogue.co.uk/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/uk/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d5485eee598280008780b78/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/original", "http://www.vogue.co.uk/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d5485eee598280008780b78/2:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/original"], "top_img": "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d5485eee598280008780b78/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/original", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Janelle Okwodu"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/rihanna-coachella-2018-wardrobe-interview", "title": "The Story Behind Rihanna\u2019s Epic Coachella Wardrobe", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Janelle Okwodu", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "See all of Rihanna's eye-catching fashion moments from Coachella 2018", "id": "5d5485eef2348600081450a2", "keywords": "news,rihanna,coachella", "news_keywords": "news,rihanna,coachella", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5d5485eef2348600081450a2", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"See all of Rihanna's eye-catching fashion moments from Coachella 2018\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d5485eee598280008780b78/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/original\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d5485eee598280008780b78/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/original\"}", "og": {"description": "When it comes to fashion, no one competes with Rihanna", "image": "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d5485eee598280008780b78/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/original", "site_name": "British Vogue", "title": "The Story Behind Rihanna\u2019s Epic Coachella Wardrobe", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/rihanna-coachella-2018-wardrobe-interview"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-04-17T13:56:34.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-04-17T13:56:34.000Z", "author": "Janelle Okwodu"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@BritishVogue", "description": "When it comes to fashion, no one competes with Rihanna", "domain": "https://www.vogue.co.uk", "image": "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d5485eee598280008780b78/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/original?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@BritishVogue", "title": "The Story Behind Rihanna\u2019s Epic Coachella Wardrobe"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d5485eee598280008780b78/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/original"}, "fb": {"app_id": 449870811704655, "pages": 104958196201736}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523973394.0, "source": "http://www.vogue.co.uk", "summary": ""}
