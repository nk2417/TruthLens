They\u2019ll join big sister Blue Ivy Carter, born in January 2012.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 announced her pregnancy via Instagram on February 1. The post \u2014 showing the singer embracing her baby bump in a garden scene \u2014 broke records on the social media platform. The post currently has nearly 11 million likes.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nShe performed at the Grammys later that month in a visual spectacle that included holographic technology. During the show, she took home trophies for Best Urban Contemporary Album (for \u201cLemonade\u201d) and Best Music Video (for \u201cFormation\u201d). Despite having the most nominations, she got shut out in the top four categories to Adele.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has kept a low profile in recent months, dropping out of Coachella (she was replaced by Lady Gaga) in April and skipping the Met Gala in May.\n\nThe Carter family is reportedly looking at properties in Los Angeles, having made a $120 million offer on a brand new Bel-Air property designed by architect Paul McClean.\n\nReps for the couple have not responded to requests for comment.\n\nUpdate: Mathew Knowles, Beyonce Knowles\u2019 father, tweeted an announcement of the twins\u2019 arrival on June 18 (Father\u2019s Day).", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/beyonce-twins.png?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/beyonce-twins.png?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Variety Staff", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/beyonce-twins-jay-z-report-1202408104/", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z Welcome Twins", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Beyonce and husband Jay Z welcome twins, according to reports.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Variety Staff", "tags": "Beyonc\u00e9, Jay-Z", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z Welcome Twins", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/beyonce-twins-jay-z-report-1202408104/", "description": "Beyonce and husband Jay Z welcome twins, according to reports.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/beyonce-twins.png?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Beyonce Twins"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-18T02:53:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-18T22:02:56+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Beyonce and husband Jay Z welcome twins, according to reports.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@Variety", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z Welcome Twins", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/beyonce-twins.png?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497754432.0, "source": "http://variety.com", "summary": ""}
