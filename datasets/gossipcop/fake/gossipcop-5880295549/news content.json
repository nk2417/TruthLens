Your favorite Calabasas power couple is still really, really in love. Having just welcomed their daughter into the world, the two sat down to talk love, crying, custom Stormi chains, and more in their GQ cover story. The most shocking detail they revealed? Kylie and Travis never had a first date.\n\n\u201cWe don't go on dates,\u201d Kylie confessed. According to the story, the two met at Coachella, although neither remembered where. It was more of a hang-out than a date, but clearly, it went well. After the festival, there wasn\u2019t time to plan an official first date, or even an unofficial second date. Travis was headed to the next stop on his \u201cBirds Eye View\u201d tour, so Kylie left Calabasas to follow him.\n\n\u201cCoachella was one of the stops on his tour,\u201d she explained. \u201cSo he said, \u2018I'm going back on tour\u2014what do we want to do about this?\u2019 Because we obviously liked each other. And I was like, \u2018I guess I'm going with you.\u201d Which is such an epic love risk that even Kylie admitted the move was \u201ccrazy romantic.\u201d She continued, \u201cI really jumped on the bus ... And then we rode off into the sunset. I did the whole tour with him.\u201d\n\nAs for the Kar-Jenner clan\u2019s thoughts on the whole thing? They apparently respected her decision. As we know, Kylie has always been fiercely independent. \u201cMy whole family knows that I do whatever I'm going to do,\u201d Kylie said. \u201cI've been that way my whole life. I don't really answer to anybody. I live on my own, and so I just rode off into the sunset.\u201d\n\nWhile traveling across the country with your new maybe-boyfriend for three months might sound like a lot of commitment early on, Kylie said touring with Travis not only strengthened their relationship, but protected their privacy.\n\n\u201cWe had a lot of downtime,\u201d she recalled. \u201cIt was organic. And we would just go to these random cities. We got to not be who we really were. Like, if we were in L.A., I feel like it would've been way different. Everything happened for a reason. We weren't going out as \u201cKylie and Trav.\u201d We would just be in Cleveland, walking the street for hours. We would go on walks, and no one would bother us.\u201d", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6904cb0189b8f8cb8d24de9c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b4df7389755cd1681a2f7f8/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/lede.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/690361f2d823e0864c4190b6/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6915ab5cf123d4b2f5690bc6/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6855545f9550c207fb02e715/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68fceec7daf24cf1ce68ee66/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/691264c344b56dadab2b775d/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68fb64776dd0af23895099d2/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b4df73fde9cf67dcdabaad1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68f8df38ca7f0ee7c7506f40/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/69138d7bbc6eeda96f4c6446/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/67dd51619d07f017918d6063/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6894890bb0414fdff135dbc0/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6915dfa80af7af3c9ac600c3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b4df73fde9cf67dcdabaad1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hanna Lustig"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kylie-jenner-says-she-travis-scott-dont-go-on-dates", "title": "Kylie Jenner Says She and Travis Scott \"Don't Go on Dates\"", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Hanna Lustig", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "In a new interview with \"GQ,\" Kylie Jenner opened up about her relationship with Travis Scott and how they first got together.", "id": "5b4df64106a31e53f19913c8", "keywords": "kylie jenner,travis scott", "news_keywords": "kylie jenner,travis scott", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b4df64106a31e53f19913c8", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In a new interview with \\\"GQ,\\\" Kylie Jenner opened up about her relationship with Travis Scott and how they first got together.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b4df73aac39084f512059f8/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/tout.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b4df73aac39084f512059f8/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/tout.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\u201cWe don't go on dates.\"", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b4df73fde9cf67dcdabaad1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott Never Had an Official \"First Date\"", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kylie-jenner-says-she-travis-scott-dont-go-on-dates"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-07-17T15:29:44.706Z", "modified_time": "2018-07-17T15:29:44.706Z", "author": "Hanna Lustig"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "\u201cWe don't go on dates.\"", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b4df73fde9cf67dcdabaad1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott Never Had an Official \"First Date\""}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b4df73fde9cf67dcdabaad1/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/FB.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531841384.706, "source": "http://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
