Some women pronounced the Duchess superhuman. Others offered blunt comparisons to their own postpartum conditions. Mercifully, most seemed to realize Kate\u2019s seemingly supernatural ability to bounce back is not normal. But by focusing so much on her flawless appearance, we are distracted from the real trauma, physical and emotional, that is the childbirth experience.\n\nI have three kids: twins the first time (one born vaginally, the second, four hours later, by Cesarean section) and a singleton (also by Cesarean section) after 16 hours of labor and two hours of unsuccessful pushing.\n\nMy pregnancies, apart from the unplanned C-sections, were normal and uneventful. And I went through all the things the vast majority of postpartum women experience (Kate too, probably): vaginal bleeding, uterine cramps, engorged breasts, raging hormones, soreness, exhaustion, constipation and the general condition of feeling as if you\u2019ve been run over by a truck.\n\n...a significant number of women, more than half by some counts, experience pelvic injury or dysfunction as a result of childbirth.\n\nBut we don\u2019t like to talk about these things. And we definitely don\u2019t like to talk about the longer term physical struggles many postpartum women endure: urinary and fecal incontinence, acute pelvic pain, back pain, muscle tears, hairline fractures, prolapsed bladder, pain during sex (if one can even summon the desire: low sex drive is another unpleasant side effect) and the \u201cmummy tummy\u201d (medically known as diastasis recti), what happens when a woman\u2019s abdomen stretches and separates to accommodate a growing fetus, but fails to knit itself back together. Many of these symptoms don\u2019t appear immediately, and because these topics are not often talked about, women often assume symptoms are just the new normal.\n\nWomen\u2019s health is the most popular of political footballs (to some people, it\u2019s still a pre-existing condition to be a woman), and it\u2019s also the most stigmatized. The female genitalia, in particular, is a gray area, a taboo even, something referred to as \u201cdown there\u201d or \u201cprivate parts\u201d or, if you\u2019re Oprah, \u201cvajayjay.\u201d The pelvic floor \u2014 the hammock of muscles that hold a woman\u2019s bladder, bowel and uterus where they belong \u2014 isn\u2019t visible, like a quad muscle, and it can be hard for women to pinpoint areas of discomfort. Most people don\u2019t even know what a pelvis looks like, apart from a skeleton they\u2019ve seen during Halloween.\n\nDonna Chiao, DPT, an orthopedic and pelvic health physical therapist, holds a model pelvis. (Courtesy of the author)\n\nBut a significant number of women, more than half by some counts, experience pelvic injury or dysfunction as a result of childbirth.\n\nThink about the women you know who joke about wetting their pants just a little bit when they laugh (one in three report urinary incontinence after childbirth), or resign themselves to pain during sex (that\u2019s about one-third of all women too), or just assume a lumpy tummy \u2014 as my kids so lovingly called mine \u2014 is part of motherhood.\n\nNot enough women know they can resolve some, if not all, of these issues with physical therapy.\n\nAfter the birth of my third child, I was eager to get back to my regular running routine. When my OBGYN gave me the \u2018all clear\u2019 at my postpartum appointment, I vowed to start back slowly, running for a minute, then walking for a minute, to regain my strength and stamina.\n\nAfter a few jogs, I was hobbling around, worried that my insides might fall out and splatter against the pavement.\n\nI called my doctor, the very one who gave me the green light. She recommended a couple of places for women\u2019s specific physical therapy, but the waitlist at Mt. Auburn Hospital, where I delivered, was 45 names long \u2014 so long they weren\u2019t even willing to add my name to the queue. I was eventually able to get an appointment with an outstanding women\u2019s health therapist at Marathon Sports in Newton, but I had to wait six weeks for my first appointment.\n\nMy experience isn\u2019t uncommon. There are more women who need help than specialists who can provide care. (At Marathon, the average wait is four to six months.) Part of the scarcity of care has to do with the extensive clinical training pelvic floor specialists need to do internal pelvic exams. My PT, Donna Chiao, completed seven years of education beyond high school, not including all the continuing education courses she had to take after receiving her doctorate. She told me that anything regarding the pelvic floor is rarely taught as part of the standard physical therapy curriculum, even in doctoral degree programs.\n\nMaybe frank conversations in popular culture can help to change the way women\u2019s bodies are perceived and treated medically.\n\nIn the end, I was lucky. My complication \u2014 pain in the cartilage joint that connects my pubic bones, known as pubic symphysis pain -- was resolved with strength training and lots of foam rolling. But I was incensed that my OBGYN gave me the go-ahead to start exercising without a thorough evaluation. She saw me through my pregnancy, but bore no responsibility to treat me in its aftermath.\n\nIn France, all postpartum women are prescribed 10 visits with a pelvic floor physical therapist as a standard of care. And have been since 1985.\n\nThe good news is there are inklings that the way our culture talks about women\u2019s health \u2014 and childbirth \u2014 may be changing. Samantha Bee did a hilarious bit on the history of women\u2019s pain. Gwen Jorgensen, the Olympic triathlon champion- turned-marathoner, talks openly about her postpartum pelvic floor rehabilitation. Abby Norman and Lena Dunham have written about their harrowing experiences with endometriosis. Meghan O\u2019Connell\u2019s new book, \u201cAnd Now We Have Everything\u201d talks about early motherhood with a compelling rawness: \u201cMy entire middle section \u2026 looked like a balloon that had been deflated but also, somehow, was full of wet dough.\u201d\n\nLoad YouTube video\n\nMaybe frank conversations in popular culture can help to change the way women\u2019s bodies are perceived and treated medically.\n\nFor now, though, I hope the Duchess of Cambridge is home, resting, in giant mesh underwear and support leggings, sipping tea in between appointments with her women\u2019s health specialist.", "images": ["https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_18113621489949-1000x699.jpg", "https://img.youtube.com/vi/DwVfdX56gL8/hqdefault.jpg", "https://media.wbur.org/wp/2018/04/image1-1000x1333.jpeg", "https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cloe-axelson_headshot-600x600.jpg"], "top_img": "https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_18113621489949-1000x699.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cloe Axelson", "More"], "canonical_link": "https://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2018/04/30/kate-middleton-postpartum-cloe-axelson", "title": "Sure, Kate Middleton Looks Great \u2014 But Let\u2019s Talk About What Giving Birth Really Does To Women\u2019s Bodies", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "By focusing so much on the Duchess's flawless appearance, writes Cloe Axelson, we are distracted from the real trauma that is childbirth.", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Sure, Kate Middleton Looks Great \u2014 But Let\u2019s Talk About What Giving Birth Really Does To Women\u2019s Bodies", "description": "By focusing so much on the Duchess's flawless appearance, writes Cloe Axelson, we are distracted from the real trauma that is childbirth.", "url": "https://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2018/04/30/kate-middleton-postpartum-cloe-axelson", "image": {"identifier": "https://wordpress.wbur.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/AP_18113621489949-1000x699.jpg", "alt": "In this Monday, April 23, 2018 photo, Britain's Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, pose for a photo with their newborn baby son as they leave the Lindo wing at St Mary's Hospital in London.
