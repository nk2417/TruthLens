The march comes on the heels of Friday's announcement that the Environmental Protection Agency will remove a page on the science of climate change from its website while it is \"under review.\"\n\nSaturday's demonstration comes just one week after Earth Day and a global March for Science, but organizers and participants stress their overlapping yet different aims. The Climate March focuses specifically on climate change and urging the world to take climate justice seriously. While the March for Science was dominated by scientists and researchers, the Climate March features labor activists, indigenous peoples affected by climate change, and more.\n\nEnvironmental activist and former vice president Al Gore was among marching in Washington Saturday. He tweeted a call to action, referencing his climate change documentary An Inconvenient Truth (and its follow-up, An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power, in theaters July 28) with the hashtag #BeInconvenient and encouraging his followers to stream the march live.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio and Lee Pace were among other celebrities showing their support for the cause. DiCaprio joined indigenous leaders to speak out against the devastating effects climate change is already having on native lands.\n\nWhile tens of thousands of demonstrators joined marches around the world, activists, politicians, and actors expressed their support of today's march on Twitter. Politically vocal actors Mark Ruffalo and Jane Fonda sent messages of love and unity to protestors, while the likes of the Jane Goodall Institute, Bernie Sanders, Alyssa Milano, and Kerry Washington shared calls to action and messages of gratitude.\n\nView a sampling of tweets below.", "images":
