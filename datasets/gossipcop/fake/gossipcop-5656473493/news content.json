Recent reports have claimed that the two are getting married, while others claim they're not ready yet, which Stefani briefly addressed.\n\n\"It's weird because, I get nervous when you talk to me about him,\" she admitted. \"I don't know why, but for some reason, the cameras are rolling and I shouldn't say something. So if I say, 'We are [getting married],' then we are, and if I say, 'No, we're not,' then that would be sad, too.\"\n\nStefani then asked DeGeneres -- who tied the knot with Portia de Rossi in 2008 -- for her advice on marriage, and what she thinks she \"should do about it.\"\n\n\"I love being married,\" DeGeneres marveled. \"I think you should get married.\"\n\nThat's when Stefani began to open up a bit more, saying, \"You know what? I love weddings, the kids love him.\"\n\n\"We love him,\" she continued, speaking on behalf of the three kids, sons Kingston, Zuma and Apollo, that she shares with her ex-husband, Gavin Rossadale. \"Everybody loves him. He's lovable. I think about [marriage] all the time.\"\n\nLater in the show, Stefani also talked about her just-announced Las Vegas residency, Gwen Stefani: Just a Girl, coming to the Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino this summer. The platinum blond beauty is scheduled to play 25 live shows between June 2018 and March 2019.\n\n\"I feel really nervous about it, but really excited,\" she admitted. \"I know I'm doing it, but it doesn't feel real.\"\n\nStefani, along with residency promoter Live Nation Las Vegas and Caesars Entertainment, will also be using the exciting show to do some good. They've teamed up in partnership with Cure 4 The Kids Foundation, meaning $1 of every ticket sold will be donated to the Las Vegas-based non-profit charity.\n\n\"Every ticket I sell for the show, $1 is going to Cure for Kids, which is a local Vegas charity,\" she explained to DeGeneres. \"It just feels good, you know?\"\n\nAdditionally, DeGeneres and Stefani announced that they are giving fans of The Ellen DeGeneres Show exclusive access to presale tickets by using code ELLENGWEN on Ticketmaster.
