But then my second reaction ended up being like, hey, that\u2019s actually a really interesting character they\u2019re writing about. \u2018She jetsets around the world collecting men and she can get any of them but she\u2019s so clingy that they leave and she cries and she gets another one in her web and she traps them and locks them in her mansion and she\u2019s crying in her marble bathtub surrounded by pearls.\u2019 So I was like, I could use this\u2026\u201d\n\n(Credit: Vevo) (Credit: Vevo)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo in summary: have a seat Kanye.", "images":
