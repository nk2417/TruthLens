After recently getting flak for letting her 5-year-old daughter, Maxwell, wear lipstick during a mommy-daughter afternoon at a MAC store, keyboard warriors are now going after her for posting a sexy photo to her Instagram account. The singer uploaded a picture of herself sitting in a makeup chair sporting a green silk robe, and people are finding ways to call her out for it.\n\nJessica posted the photo to her account on Dec. 9, and since then there have been hundreds of comments on the post, many of which are supportive, but as unfortunately expected, there were a few sour grapes in the bunch. One woman took a sarcastic approach by commenting: \"Great example for your daughter!\" Another added: \"Is this how a mother of two little children really wants to act? Get it together Jessica, those days should be behind you.\" Some also suggested that she shouldn't be taking sexy pictures simply because she's a wife and mom. \"Posing for playboy?\" a commenter wrote. \" . . . Isn't she married w kids? [What the hell]?\"\n\nAlthough we hate that Jessica has to see those types of comments on her photos, all we can hope is one day people will finally realize that being kind is a heck of a lot easier than being nasty, especially on social media. After all, celebrities have feelings, too.", "images": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/0jWZ6_MbQQaY7LW4b1l9pi30Q0I=/fit-in/2100x1097/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2017/12/11/694/n/24155406/b3fb1ff35a2ea6e886e574.55480281_edit_img_facebook_post_image_file_44352237_1513005132.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/0jWZ6_MbQQaY7LW4b1l9pi30Q0I=/fit-in/2100x1097/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2017/12/11/694/n/24155406/b3fb1ff35a2ea6e886e574.55480281_edit_img_facebook_post_image_file_44352237_1513005132.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Murphy Moroney", "Published On Dec", "At Pm"], "canonical_link": "https://www.popsugar.com/family/jessica-simpson-mom-shamed-sexy-photo-44352237", "title": "Jessica Simpson Got Mom-Shamed Again, and This Time It Has Nothing to Do With Parenting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "keywords": "popsugar, murphy moroney, family, jessica simpson, parenting, celebrity families, parenting news, parent shaming", "robots": "max-image-preview:large, follow, index", "bingbot": "nocache", "google-site-verification": "-ULnbgnS51gqvbNlz7JAhFDpYe74n2hhzpfc4KXeONA", "description": "PS makes wellness more accessible through real-life stories, first-person perspectives, and expert-backed information.
