She had been traveling with him on his tour and he was off during her surgery and right after during her recovery,\u201d the insider says.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been very caring and it\u2019s meant a lot to her to have him by her side.\u201d The pair were seen out and about on Friday in New York City.\n\nBACKGRID\n\nGomez revealed the transplant news in an Instagram post on Thursday, sharing a photo of herself and her friend, Francia Raisa \u2014 who donated a kidney \u2014 next to each other in hospital beds.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very aware some of my fans had noticed I was laying low for part of the summer and questioning why I wasn\u2019t promoting my new music, which I was extremely proud of,\u201d Gomez wrote in the post. \u201cSo I found out I needed to get a kidney transplant due to my Lupus and was recovering. It was what I needed to do for my overall health.\u201d\n\nThe insider says that Gomez is \u201cfeeling much better\u201d in the wake of the operation.\n\nSelena Gomez Instagram\n\n\u201cShe was feeling really lethargic and worn out before the surgery,\u201d the insider tells PEOPLE. \u201cThe surgery was a couple months ago so she\u2019s been recovering and is in a much healthier place now. Her close group of girlfriends have all been there for her\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, another source told PEOPLE that The Weeknd scheduled performances around Gomez\u2019s medical emergency.\n\nMeet Francia Raisa, Selena Gomez\u2019s Actress BFF Who Gave Her a Kidney\n\nThe Weeknd was in between dates of his Starboy: Legend of the Fall Tour from July 22 through Aug. 6, then again until Sept. 6.\n\nThe Grammy winner\u2019s Grey Goose-sponsored show was canceled last-minute on Aug. 26 \u2014 and though he was initially announced as a performer for the 2017 MTV VMAs, he was a no-show Aug. 27 at The Forum in Inglewood, California.", "images":
