No huge controversies, sure, but not even Katy\u2019s terrible opening monologue was especially memorable.\n\nThat\u2019s a problem for Katy, but it might be an even bigger problem for American Idol producers, who are reportedly very concerned that they\u2019re paying $25 million to Katy Perry to be a judge only for her to flop.\n\nOn Sunday, I had friends over, and they mentioned that traffic was especially slow near my home.\n\nWhy? Because American Idol auditions were in town.\n\nYes, in case you\u2019ve managed to forget, American Idol is coming back, like some archetypal horde that people thought had been defeated.\n\nThe biggest stir of publicity about it is Katy Perry\u2019s salary of $25 million.\n\nDon\u2019t get us wrong, she\u2019s a big-time celebrity who\u2019s hosted the Superbowl, which is probably what the American Idol producers and the network were thinking when they hired her.\n\nWhat they clearly weren\u2019t thinking about:\n\nOne, that Katy Perry was singing for her Superbowl Halftime show, which is very different from sitting at a table and talking and judging.\n\nTwo, that Katy Perry was pretty famously upstaged at that show by Left Shark. You didn\u2019t forget Left Shark, did you?\n\n(Getty)\n\nWell now, RadarOnline is reporting that ABC higher ups and American Idol showrunners are worried that they made a mistake by hiring Katy Perry to be a judge.\n\nIt sounds like they\u2019re panicking, actually.\n\nRadarOnline\u2018s source reports that her lackluster hosting over the weekend is what has them so concerned.\n\n\"They are paying her $25 million and she was a total dud [on the VMAs].\"\n\nYou might be wondering how they didn\u2019t catch it earlier, right?\n\nHere\u2019s how:\n\n\"No one ever auditioned her for the new Idol job and they are freaking out that they hired someone who is terrible on live television.\"\n\nOh dear!\n\n(MTV)\n\nUsually, if you get a job without applying for it (or auditioning, in this case), it\u2019s because someone who\u2019s seen your work up close before (maybe a coworker or a former boss) is either doing the hiring or has vouched for you.\n\nIt sounds like Katy was just offered the gig, sight unseen.\n\nABC had already had concerns, RadarOnline had previously reported, that Katy Perry might upstage contestants.\n\n(Like Mariah Carey)\n\nOr that she might just need to tone down \u2026 not her look, but her very attention-grabbing personality.\n\n(As far as we can tell, that\u2019s not a euphemism for her boobs)\n\nJudges are supposed to evaluate contestants, not overshadow them.\n\n(Getty)\n\nNow, though, it sounds like ABC and American Idol are afraid that Katy\u2019s just going to fall flat like she did at the VMAs.\n\nJust because someone is good at singing and performing doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re good at talking on camera.\n\nSimilarly, like, just because someone\u2019s great at giving interview or interviewing people doesn\u2019t mean that they have a dazzling singing voice or would make an amazing performer.\n\nThis should be a lesson to us all, we suppose: make sure that you hire the best and most highly recommended babysitter or dog-walker or whatever. Not just the one who happens to be hot.", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/2552_D085_00216R-H-2025-80x80.webp", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/demi-lovato-wears-black-scaled.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1154615733-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1119_whitneyleavitt_04-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2159895990-6-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/katy-perry-2017-mtv-vmas-683x1024.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/kp-876x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/joel-osteen-in-2011-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_annaduggar_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1119_janellebrown_angelamoody_header-80x80.png", "http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/katy-perry-crying-1024x682.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/69023040a27d084abe99b818-80x80.webp", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1119_tekashi6ix9ine_header-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/jon-snow-in-kings-landing-320x240.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/katy-perry-host-pic-1024x996.png"], "top_img": "http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/katy-perry-crying-1024x682.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Simon Delott"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/08/katy-perry-disastrous-vmas-hosting-has-american-idol-producers-i/", "title": "Katy Perry: Disastrous VMAs Hosting Has American Idol Producers in a PANIC!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Katy Perry: Disastrous VMAs Hosting Has American Idol Producers in a PANIC!", "description": "Folks who didn't watch the VMAs on Sunday because they were too busy watching relatives bone on Game of Thrones or escaping rising floodwaters, answer this: Wha", "url": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/08/katy-perry-disastrous-vmas-hosting-has-american-idol-producers-i/", "site_name": "The Hollywood Gossip", "updated_time": "2022-04-25T07:11:10+00:00", "image": "http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/katy-perry-crying-1024x682.jpg", "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-29 18:14:33", "modified_time": "2022-04-25 07:11:10"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-29T18:14:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-04-25T07:11:10+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Katy Perry: Disastrous VMAs Hosting Has American Idol Producers in a PANIC!", "description": "Folks who didn't watch the VMAs on Sunday because they were too busy watching relatives bone on Game of Thrones or escaping rising floodwaters, answer this: Wha", "image": "http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/katy-perry-crying-1024x682.jpg", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Simon Delott", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "author": "Simon Delott", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "theme-color": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/07/cropped-THG-LOGO-270x270.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504030473.0, "source": "http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com", "summary": ""}
