But Cara wants to do what makes her happy and fulfils her. She knows that's not modelling in the long term.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nAll of the actress's projects will now be dealt with by American agency William Morris and it seems Storm have been quick to cut ties by deleting her from the main board of models they represent on their website.\n\nBrit Cara is taking control of her career and is currently filming Suicide Squad, based on the DC Comics, in Toronto, in which she plays the character Enchantress.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nHowever, she is believed to have not fully quit her modelling career yet with major fashion houses now having to go through William Morris instead of Storm Models as she fronts a number of campaigns.\n\nView 3 Images Cara Delevingne on cover of Vogue\n\nTaking a swipe at the modelling industry, she recently told Vogue magazine : \"The thrill of acting is making a character real. Modeling is the opposite of real. It's being fake in front of the camera.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nThe Paper Towns actress also admitted she is still working on her craft but insists acting is her passion and she's determined to make it in the movie world.\n\nCara said: \"I probably should learn how to act. I've charmed my way through it so far. Maybe I'll 'suck' but maybe I won't.\" She seems to be brilliant at everything so we don't think she needs to worry.\n\nMirror Celeb has contacted Storm Models for a comment.", "images": ["http://www.irishmirror.ie/assets/irishmirror/logos/masthead-irishmirror-default.svg", "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/article5949863.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Cara-Delevingne-on-cover-of-Vogue.jpg", "http://www.irishmirror.ie/nav-web-static/release-v41-14493b7c888038a7d89b99cb3a7937c2b71eaebe/public/logo-reach.png", "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/article5986708.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Cara-new-main.jpg", "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/article5986709.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Storm-models.jpg", "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/article5986708.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Cara-new-main.jpg", "http://www.irishmirror.ie/footer/trust-project.svg"], "top_img": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/article5986708.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Cara-new-main.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katy Forrester", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.irishmirror.ie/showbiz/celebrity-news/cara-delevingne-deleted-storm-models-5986712", "title": "Cara Delevingne DELETED from Storm Models website after 'ditching the agency to focus on acting'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 158655517639984, "page_id": 191236384249467, "pages": 1809191346075207}, "description": "The supermodel and actress has set her sights on making it in Hollywood and has reportedly dropped the agency who signed her at 15", "author": "Katy Forrester", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "Googlebot-News": "noarchive", "referrer": "unsafe-URL", "keywords": "Cara Delevingne, William Morris, Suicide Squad, Celebrity style, Kate Moss, Fashion", "news_keywords": "Cara Delevingne, William Morris, Suicide Squad, Celebrity style, Kate Moss, Fashion", "allowTaboolaDeepDive": "true", "og": {"title": "Cara Delevingne is DELETED from Storm Models website after 'ditching the agency'", "description": "The supermodel and actress has set her sights on making it in Hollywood and has reportedly dropped the agency who signed her at 15", "url": "http://www.irishmirror.ie/showbiz/celebrity-news/cara-delevingne-deleted-storm-models-5986712", "site_name": "Irish Mirror", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/article5986708.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Cara-new-main.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-07-02T08:46:07Z", "modified_time": "2015-07-02T08:57:49Z", "author": "Katy Forrester", "section": "Celebrity News", "tag": "Fashion"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@irishmirror", "creator": "@mirrorkaty", "title": "Cara Delevingne DELETED from Storm Models website after 'ditching the agency to focus on acting' - Irish Mirror", "description": "The supermodel and actress has set her sights on making it in Hollywood and has reportedly dropped the agency who signed her at 15", "image": "https://i2-prod.irishmirror.ie/article5986708.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Cara-new-main.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1435826767.0, "source": "http://www.irishmirror.ie", "summary": ""}
