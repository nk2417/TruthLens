And though it only gives us a tiny glimpse of Roberts in character as caseworker Heidi Bergman (she literally just scribbles down some notes, says the above line to someone off camera and then clicks on a tape recorder) we\u2019re already entranced by her calm, collected mannerisms. Luckily, Amazon also revealed that you won\u2019t have to wait much longer, as \u201cHomecoming\u201d will premiere this November on the streaming service.\n\nThe rest of the one-minute clip promoting the mind-bending drama directed by \u201cMr. Robot\u201d creator Sam Esmail, explores the abandoned halls of what we can safely assume is the titular Homecoming Transitional Support Center where Heidi workers, a Geist Group facility helping soldiers transition back to civilian life.\n\nWalter Cruz (Stephan James) is one of these soldiers, eager to begin the next phase of his life. Overseeing Heidi and the facility is Colin Belfast (Bobby Cannavale), an ambitious company man whose manic demands point to questionable motives.\n\nFour years later, Heidi has started a new life, living with her mother (Sissy Spacek) and working as a small-town waitress, when a Department of Defense auditor (Shea Whigham) comes to her with questions about why she left the Homecoming facility. Heidi begins to realize that there\u2019s a whole other story behind the story she\u2019s been telling herself.\n\nBased on the popular podcast of the same name, \u201cHomecoming\u201d is created by Eli Horowitz and Micah Bloomberg. Along with Roberts, the cast includes Jeremy Allen White, Alex Karpovsky and Dermot Mulroney, among others.\n\nMulroney is set for a recurring guest star role as Anthony, Heidi\u2019s (Roberts) boyfriend, who is eager to please, but a bit needy and grows increasingly frustrated with Heidi\u2019s lack of attention to him and their relationship.\n\n\u201cHomecoming\u201d is produced by Esmail through his production company Esmail Corp; as well as \u201cMr. Robot\u201d executive producer Chad Hamilton of Anonymous Content; the podcast\u2019s Horowitz and Bloomberg; and Chris Giliberti, Alex Blumberg, and Matt Lieber of Gimlet Media. Roberts will also serve as executive producer through her production company Red Om Films; her partners Lisa Gillan and Marisa Yeres Gill will co-executive produce.\n\nWatch the trailer above.\n\n\u201cHomecoming\u201d will debut Friday, Nov. 2 on Prime Video.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?fit=53%2C58&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Julia-Roberts-Homecoming-Amazon.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/5x4_082025_COVER_B.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Julia-Roberts-Homecoming-Amazon.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Maas", "Tv Reporter", "Jennifer.Maas Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/homecoming-teaser-julia-roberts-amazon-video/", "title": "\u2018Homecoming\u2019: Julia Roberts Is Ready to \u2018Get Started\u2019 in First Teaser for Amazon Series (Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Homecoming': Julia Roberts Is Ready to 'Get Started' in First Teaser for Amazon Series (Video)", "description": "San Diego Comic-Con 2018: Streaming service reveals drama's fall premiere date", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/homecoming-teaser-julia-roberts-amazon-video/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Julia-Roberts-Homecoming-Amazon.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2018-07-20T23:45:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-20T23:45:48+00:00"}, "author": "Jennifer Maas", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Jennifer Maas", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "amazon, comic-con, comic-con-2018, homecoming, julia_roberts, san-diego-comic-con", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "dailies, report-comic-con, tv, videos", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532130303.0, "source": "http://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
