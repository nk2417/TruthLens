And to achieve this, he will keep releasing interviews, despite his daughter and her husband, Prince Harry being said to have grown \u201cfrustrated\u201d with his continued appearance on the media. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT The former lightning and photography director told TMZ: \"I was silent for a full year and the press beat me up every day saying I was a hermit hiding in Mexico, so I gave my story. \"Apparently that interview put the Royal Family in their silence mode... so, I gave another interview to break the silence. \u201cAll they have to do is speak to me.\u201d Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nMr Markle believes he forced the Windsors into a media blackout. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT He added: \"Tomorrow [Wednesday] is my birthday, 74 years old, and I\u2019m enjoying the fact that I can make the entire Royal Family not speak and maybe I can get a laugh out of the Duchess.\u201d But the royals never directly addressed any of the issues raised by Mr Markle, who in the past months has given numerous interviews, including one where he revealed Meghan hasn\u2019t returned his calls for more than two months. The only time Kensington Palace replied to Mr Markle was to ask the media for \u201cunderstanding and respect\u201d for him after he revealed he would not attend his daughter Royal Wedding.\n\nThomas Markle hit out at the royals asking them to break their silence\n\nThe Duchess\u2019 father also vowed to fly to Britain. He said: \u201cIf I chose in a month, or couple of months, to go to England, I want to see my daughter. I'm thinking about it. \u201cI don't care whether she is p***** off at me or not. \u201cI'm not going to wave flags and make a fool of myself.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
