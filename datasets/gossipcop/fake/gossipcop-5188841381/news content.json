It\u2019s not a good look for Scott, at all.\u2019\n\nKendall, 21, replied by saying Scott thought he was making Kourtney \u2013 with whom he has Mason, seven, Penelope, five, and Reign, two \u2013 \u2018mad\u2019 by going on a vacation with Bella.\n\nScott arriving in Nice in May (Picture: Alex Huckle/SilverHub/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nBut Kim considered Scott\u2019s behaviour to be \u2018malicious\u2019 as he was also seen partying with a number of other women, including Sofia Richie and Ella Ross, while Kourtney was on holiday with her new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.\n\nShe explained: \u2018I think it\u2019s clear to everyone that Scott is doing this just to try to one-up Kourtney, and that seems super malicious.\n\n\u2018Kourtney is genuinely trying to go away and have a good time and he\u2019s trying to like, freak her out and make Kourtney think that there\u2019s gonna be some crazy drama running. It\u2019s just so ridiculous.\u2019\n\nAt the height of the drama, Kourtney claims Scott messaged her saying: \u2018Anyone who gets in the middle [between us] will not be pleased with the outcome.\u2019\n\nAfter learning of Kourtney\u2019s accusation, her sister Khloe also blasted the way Scott behaved, calling him \u2018childish\u2019.\n\nShe said: \u2018I just can\u2019t believe that he would stoop this low and speak to her like this.\n\n\u2018At the end of the day, she\u2019s still the mother of his children. So to say that he\u2019s gonna have people get beat up? That\u2019s disgusting. So I really hope he was out of his right mind \u2026 It\u2019s just so childish.\u2019", "images":
