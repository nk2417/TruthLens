What are you planning on doing now?\u2019 And you say, \u2018Uh, I\u2019m just going to take a second and like do something other than that,\u2019\u201d she told HuffPost Live. \u201c[But suddenly the headline reads] Kristen Stewart Quits Hollywood!\u201d\u201d\n\nStewart was interviewed alongside her \u201cStill Alice\u201d co-star Julianne Moore, so much of the conversation touched upon their critically acclaimed film that focuses on Moore\u2019s struggle with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which is slowly corrupting her mind and threatens to tear apart her family.\n\nThe conversation also hit on other topics, including Stewart\u2019s broodiness as a 12-year-old and how the world flocks to tabloid gossip stories that she\u2019s featured in.\n\n\u201cThere is like, you know, a whole other form of entertainment that is just voraciously consumed,\u201d she said. Luckily, she believes people know the difference between fact and fiction and is banking on her fans taking the media with \u201ca whole big boulder of salt.\u201d\n\nThe actress, who got her big break as Jodie Foster\u2018s daughter in the 2002 David Fincher film \u201cPanic Room,\u201d didn\u2019t become a household name until starring as Bella opposite Taylor Lautner and Robert Pattinson in the film adaptations of Stephenie Meyer\u2019s \u201cTwilight\u201d novels.\n\nHer real life love affair with co-star Pattinson captured the heart of \u201cTwilight\u2019s\u201d legion of passionate fans. But after an alleged romantic indiscretion with her \u201cSnow White and the Huntsman\u201d director Rupert Sanders was caught on camera and Stewart and Pattinson broke up, the actress suddenly found herself at the heart of a media frenzy.\n\nSince then, she has starred in projects with smaller fan bases, including \u201cStill Alice\u201d and Guantanamo Bay drama, \u201cCamp X-Ray.\u201d\n\n\u201cMovies can be important,\u201d Stewart said of \u201cStill Alice,\u201d which netted Moore a Golden Globe on Sunday. \u201cThis one is.\u201d\n\nWatch the first clip above and additional clips below:\n\nJulianne Moore Describes Meeting A Brooding 12-Year-Old Kristen Stewart\n\nKristen Stewart\u2019s Advice For Picking Roles: Don\u2019t Be \u2018So Fame Obsessed\u2019", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325_COVER-_IR_5x4.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/julianne-moore-kristen-stewart-still-alice-huffington-post.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/julianne-moore-kristen-stewart-still-alice-huffington-post.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Travis Reilly", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid", "Border-Radius Box-Shadow Rgba", "Rgba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/kristen-stewart-laughs-off-tabloid-rumors-that-shes-quitting-acting-video/", "title": "Kristen Stewart Laughs Off Tabloid Reports That She\u2019s Quitting Acting (Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kristen Stewart Laughs Off Tabloid Reports That She's Quitting Acting (Video)", "description": "The \"Still Alice\" actress says she hopes people take stories about her \"with a whole big boulder of salt\"", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/kristen-stewart-laughs-off-tabloid-rumors-that-shes-quitting-acting-video/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/julianne-moore-kristen-stewart-still-alice-huffington-post.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-13T23:41:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-14T02:25:21+00:00"}, "author": "Travis Reilly", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mmmtravis", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Travis Reilly", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "camp-x-ray, golden_globe, jodie_foster, julianne_moore, kristen_stewart, robert-pattinson, rupert_sanders, snow_white_and_the_huntsman, stephenie_meyer, twilight", "article-categories": "dailies, movies, videos", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1421192476.0, "source": "http://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
