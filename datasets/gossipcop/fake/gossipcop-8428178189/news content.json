In a year that has seen so many surprise engagements, it seems Blake Shelton, 42, and Gwen Stefani, 49, one-upped everyone by having a surprise wedding! The two got married in March, insiders tell Star magazine, and for the past six months, the two have kept their marriage a secret! The alleged wedding took place at Blake\u2019s Tishomingo, Oklahoma ranch, at a \u201csmall gazebo by the lake,\u201d where 45 friends and family members watched. \u201cIt was super intimate. Not even locals in Tish knew it was happening,\u201d an insider tells Star.\n\n\u201cIt was the most perfect day,\u201d the source says. \u201cSimple and full of love. You could tell these two are soulmates. Blake shed a few tears during the ceremony \u2013 he\u2019s a big softy at heart.\u201d Gwent\u2019s dress was \u201ca gorgeous fitted pure white\u201d number \u201cIt was nothing over the top, just like the ceremony itself.\u201d Among the witnessed seeing these two reportedly get wed were Gwen\u2019s parents \u2013 Dennis and Patti \u2013 and her three kids, Kingston, 12, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4. Supposedly, Blake had Gwen\u2019s family fly into Oklahoma\u2019s Durant airport, before they were ferried to his 2,000-acre hunting ranch.\n\nGuests for this secret ceremony, according to Star, enjoyed a few days of hunting, fishing, and dirt bike riding in the lead-up to the nuptials. \u201cThere were cookouts and campfires, and Blake showed off his own herds of deer, antelope and wildebeests,\u201d the source says. \u201cAside from the custom-made gazebo and glamping facilities, everything else was done in house.\u201d The wedding \u201cwouldn\u2019t have cost them much more than $20,000,\u201d the source says, \u201cwhich is surprising, but that\u2019s the kind of low-key life they enjoy together.\u201d What\u2019s really a surprise is that Star reports Blake\u2019s ex, Miranda Lambert, 34, \u201ceven sent a congratulatory text when she heard the rumors! There\u2019s no hard feelings.\u201d\n\nWhile the idea that 45 people have been able to keep Gwen and Blake\u2019s marriage a secret for half a year seems crazy, 2018 is the year where that kind of madness happens all the time. After all, Cardi B and Offset pulled of the same stunt. The couple was married in September 2017, one month before he \u201cproposed\u201d to her. The two were secretly married for nine months before Offset inadvertently let the cat out of the bad at the BET Awards by calling Cardi \u201cmy wife.\u201d So, along with that and all the surprise engagements \u2013 Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin, Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas \u2013 could Blake and Gwen really be married?", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Gwen-Stefani-Blake-Shelton-Matrix-Awards-1.jpg?fit=394%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C349", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Blake-Shelton-Gwen-Stefani-gallery-2.jpg?fit=293%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-ftr.jpg?resize=384%2C216", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-rex-5.jpg?fit=293%2C440"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C349", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/08/22/are-gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-married-secret-wedding/", "title": "Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton Secretly Married For 6 Mos.?
