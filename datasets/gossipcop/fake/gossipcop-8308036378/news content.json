They will both be at the birth.\n\n\u2018Kim can\u2019t wait to hold her baby girl\u2026[she] is definitely nervous and anxious about the birth.\u2019\n\nKim Kardashian\u2019s surrogate grabs lunch in Los Angeles (Picture: Coleman-Rayner)\n\nMum-to-be Kim recently revealed that she might let her \u2018creative genius\u2019 daughter North name the baby.\n\nAccording to HollywoodLife, \u2018Kim has called on a parenting expert to get advice on what to do to avoid sibling rivalry this time around and one of the suggestions was to let North help name the baby so she feels more invested.\u2019\n\nThey continued: \u2018They\u2019re considering it, Kim\u2019s kind of on the fence about the idea but Kanye loves it. He thinks North is a creative genius and he\u2019s happy to let her name their third child.\u2019\n\nKim has previously spoken about the fact that North is already not a fan of her little brother Saint.\n\n\u2018Obviously North loves Saint, she just is still jealous,\u2019 Kim said in a video on her website Kimkardashianwest.com.\n\n\u2018She needs to still get it together and warm up and like be a little bit nicer, but I think she is getting there.
