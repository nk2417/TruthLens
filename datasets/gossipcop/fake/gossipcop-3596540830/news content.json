He said their accounts let him to believe that the North Korean leader was actually quite unassuming in person.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re in a room with him, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re always aware of where he is,\u201d Rogen explained. \u201cWe honestly tried to make him \u2014 for lack of a better word \u2014 adorable.\u201d\n\nColbert did not ask Rogen about the crippling Sony hacks which have plagued the backing studio in recent weeks, which have lead to leaks of private information and threat against the families of Sony employees. But he did imply Rogen\u2019s own safety could be in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cYou know you can\u2019t go to North Korea now,\u201d Colbert told him.\n\n\u201cI do know that, yes,\u201d Rogen replied, before adding he was going to also avoid Korean BBQ just to be safe.\n\nWatch \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d clip here.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5x4_082025_COVER.jpg?fit=240%2C300&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/seth-rogen-colbert-report.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/seth-rogen-colbert-report.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Travis Reilly", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid", "Border-Radius Box-Shadow Rgba", "Rgba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/seth-rogen-tried-to-make-kim-jong-un-adorable-in-the-interview/", "title": "Seth Rogen Tried to Make Kim Jong-un \u2018Adorable\u2019 in \u2018The Interview\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Seth Rogen Tried to Make Kim Jong-un 'Adorable' in 'The Interview'", "description": "Star and cowriter of the controversial film also admits he considered changing the North Korean dictator's name", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/seth-rogen-tried-to-make-kim-jong-un-adorable-in-the-interview/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/seth-rogen-colbert-report.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-12-16T20:07:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2014-12-16T20:09:32+00:00"}, "author": "Travis Reilly", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mmmtravis", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Travis Reilly", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "comedy_central, seth_rogen, sony-hack, sony-hack-attack, stephen-colbert, the_colbert_report", "article-categories": "dailies, movies, tv, videos", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1418760445.0, "source": "http://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
