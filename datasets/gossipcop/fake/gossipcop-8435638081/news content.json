Fergie was overcome with emotion while talking about her split from husband Josh Duhamel during an appearance on The Wendy Williams Show. The \u201cHungry\u201d singer opened up about how she and the Transformers actor are dealing with their divorce while raising their 4-year-old son, Axl.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Splits of 2017 From Kylie Jenner and Tyga to Janet Jackson and Wissam Al Mana, take a look back at the biggest and most shocking celebrity splits of 2017 \u2014 see the photos\n\n\u201cYeah. It wasn\u2019t my plan, I wanted to stay married forever,\u201d she admitted during the Thursday, October 26 episode. \u201cHe is [good looking], always will be. I love Josh, he\u2019s the father of my child. We forever have that project together, and we\u2019re doing the best we can,\u201d she said. Fergie, 42, added: \u201cYou made me cry! Gosh, two minutes in and you\u2019re getting me tearing up.\u201d\n\nFergie and Duhamel, 44, began dating in 2004 and later tied the knot in 2009. They announced the end of their eight-year marriage in September, but it was later revealed that they separated in February and decided to keep things private for a few months.\n\nRelated: Check Out Hollywood\u2019s Friendliest Exes See how Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake and many more A-listers remain pals post-breakup\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no right time. It\u2019s such a weird thing having to announce to the public because when you\u2019re in show business you have to do an announcement,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to be sure, and really just find our footing and get all the crazy hurt stuff privately before the whole barrage of media.\u201d\n\nAlthough they are now living in separate homes, the singer revealed that they are continuing to coparent their son together. \u201cDaddy has, we called it a \u2018workhouse\u2019 for a while, and now it\u2019s just his house. We\u2019re kind of transitioning into that, so he has really not felt a difference,\u201d she revealed. \u201cWe\u2019re with him all the time, we\u2019re not with him together all the time. We try to do a once a week thing where we\u2019re all three together.\u201d\n\nRelated: Fergie and Josh Duhamel\u2019s Cutest Moments With Their Son Axl Relive the most adorable moments Fergie and Josh Duhamel shared with their son Axl before ending their eight-year marriage \u2014 see the pics\n\nFergie said they will all most likely celebrate Halloween together as a family, but didn\u2019t give the host any details about her ex\u2019s dating life, adding: \u201cI have no idea, you have to ask him!\u201d The songstress, who was born Stacy Ann Ferguson, also revealed that she legally took her ex-husband\u2019s last name prior to their split and that the future of her name remains unclear.
