She thinks Kourtney is an amazing hands-on mom, and that's how she wants to be. She also reads a lot online and wants to learn as much as possible. Kourtney is encouraging her to learn about natural and organic living. Kylie is doing organic diapers and ointment.\"\n\nAnd the 20-year-old television personality - who is expecting her first child with her partner Travis Scott - is excited that Khloe is pregnant at the same time too.\n\nThe insider added to People magazine: \"It's also helped having Khlo\u00e9 go through everything with [Kylie] at the same time. She thinks it's really special that they're pregnant together.\"\n\nAnd ahead of the baby's arrival, Kylie has already baby-proofed her house.\n\nA source shared: \"The nursery is done. She's a go-getter like her mother [Kris Jenner]. No way she waited long to set that up! ... Anything sharp has already been taken out.\n\n\"She's very happy about the pregnancy but she doesn't want to share this with the world. Her not being out is strictly personal preference. She wants to keep this one aspect of her life private. She spent her adolescent life on television and has been famous for over 10 years now. If this is the first thing she wants to keep to herself, she should be allowed that. She's worked hard enough to do whatever she wants.\"", "images": ["http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/s/sarah-ferguson-is-overjoyed-her-daughter-princess-beatrice-g.jpg", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/land/250/t/travis-barker-appears-to-have-had-a-tattoo-in-honour-of-his-.jpg", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/250/s/sofa-vergara-is-sharing-a-string-of-sexy-snaps-online-in-the.jpg", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/c/cover-ultra-marine-roxhillmedia-9f0499855b471075e33613ad4a426eace801295b.jpg", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/land/250/k/kylie-jenner-is-learning-to-keep-her-personal-life-private-a.jpg", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/land/1000/k/kylie-jenner-db4d885fd99d08fe5e82f364fc6fae1482acf2db.jpg", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/t/tptgw-female-first-new.jpg", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/land/250/b/britney-spears-kardashians-catch-up-aW1hZ2VzMS8yMDI1LzExLzE1.jpg", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/p/potted-panto-1000x666-1.jpg", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/c/cover-heroes-and-traitors-roxhillmedia.jpg", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/assets/gfx/ff/logos/femalefirst.png", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/n/new-scientist-live-hospital-of-the-future.jpg", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/assets/gfx/ff/logos/femalefirst_new.png", "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/land/500/k/kylie-jenner-db4d885fd99d08fe5e82f364fc6fae1482acf2db.jpg", "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/square/250/y/yakult-xnue-groundj.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/land/500/k/kylie-jenner-db4d885fd99d08fe5e82f364fc6fae1482acf2db.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity/kylie-jenners-pregnancy-brought-closer-kourtney-kardashian-1126062.html", "title": "Kylie Jenner's pregnancy brought her closer to Kourtney Kardashian", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 107289632667069}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-adsense-account": "ca-pub-5866512050559500", "verification": "f8db4dfdc26e3eedc0900f6c4bd58b49", "google-site-verification": "ehkbOySbYjsiYiMnXAIlTNWvdkdoxl66Vcvh9JnZbBQ", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "keywords": "Kylie Jenner, Kourtney Kardashian, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, Travis Scott", "description": "Kylie Jenners pregnancy has helped her bond with Kourtney Kardashian.", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kylie Jenner's pregnancy brought her closer to Kourtney Kardashian", "description": "Kylie Jenners pregnancy has helped her bond with Kourtney Kardashian.", "url": "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/celebrity/kylie-jenners-pregnancy-brought-closer-kourtney-kardashian-1126062.html", "image": "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/land/500/k/kylie-jenner-db4d885fd99d08fe5e82f364fc6fae1482acf2db.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@FemaleFirst_UK", "title": "Kylie Jenner's pregnancy brought her closer to Kourtney Kardashian", "description": "Kylie Jenners pregnancy has helped her bond with Kourtney Kardashian.", "image": "https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/image-library/partners/bang/square/500/k/kylie-jenner-db4d885fd99d08fe5e82f364fc6fae1482acf2db.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-01T21:21:03+00:00"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517520063.0, "source": "http://www.femalefirst.co.uk", "summary": ""}
