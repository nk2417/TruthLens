And now that Pippa Middleton's wedding to James Matthews is approaching, gossip magazines (in particular, The Sun) are reporting that she has the royal equivalent of *beef* with Prince Harry's girlfriend Meghan Markle.\n\nThe specifics? Apparently, Markle won't be invited to Pippa's wedding thanks to a \"no ring, no bring\" policy\u2014with a source noting, \"It's clear Pippa doesn't want to be outshone by any TV babes on her big day.\"\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nInterestingly, Pippa's future brother-in-law Spencer Matthews is also reportedly not allowed to bring his girlfriend, reality television star Vogue Williams. \"Pippa's view is that Vogue's relationship with Spencer is still very new. It wouldn't be appropriate for her to be there after just a few months of dating,\" the source says. \"But some people in the circle are pretty shocked because this is her future brother-in-law who's going to end up attending on his own. It's certainly raised eyebrows.\"\n\n(Image credit: Getty)\n\nThe Daily Mail also reported on Pippa's \"no ring, no bring\" policy back in March, saying Meghan's appearance at the wedding of Harry's best friend raised concerns. \"She saw how all eyes were on Meghan rather than Lara last week. The situation was also stressful for Harry. Pippa and her mother Carole wonder whether Meghan's presence could cause a great deal of unnecessary chaos.\"\n\n\ud83d\udc40 to be sure, but let's take this news with a grain of Salt Bae.\n\nFollow Marie Claire on Facebook for the latest celeb news, beauty tips, fascinating reads, livestream video, and more.\n\nStay In The Know Get exclusive access to fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.
