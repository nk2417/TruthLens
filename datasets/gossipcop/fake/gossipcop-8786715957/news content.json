Fans were quick to point out that the 49-year-old actress and Pitt are both single for the first time in years. Many shared hopes that the ex\u2019s would find their way back to one another.\n\n\u2018Somewhere, Jennifer Aniston is crafting her \u201cHey, let\u2019s grab coffee and catch up\u201d text to Brad Pitt,\u2019 tweeter Madeline Hill wrote.\n\nWhile a number of fans were excited at the prospect of Aniston and Pitt reigniting their old flame, some fans were grieving the end of her seemingly-perfect marriage to Theroux, 46. Others felt it was simply time to let any lingering Aniston-Pitt nostalgia go.\n\n\u2018Please do not subject us to stories that Jennifer Aniston is getting back together with Brad Pitt. Everyone deserves a break while dealing with the end of a marriage,\u2019 Twitter user Kristyn Burtt wrote.\n\nRumors are swirling about Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt potentially rekindling their romance\n\nSome Twitter users were flat out opposed to the thought of a reunion, noting that Aniston has done well for herself since leaving Pitt in the past. The Allied actor, however, has been battling some demons.\n\n\u2018Y\u2019all really think Jennifer Aniston about to go sniffing around Brad Pitt when he got 10 kids and an alcohol addiction? Meanwhile she has a yoga body and a Smart Water deal w/ 0 kids in sight. She good,\u2019 a Twitter user under the pseudonym C.Rush shared.\n\nSo is Jennifer Aniston getting back together with Brad Pitt?\n\nJennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux split\n\nJennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their divorce on Thursday. In a statement released to the Associated Press, they revealed that they had \u2018lovingly\u2019 made the decision at the end of 2017 after nearly three years of marriage and roughly seven years as a couple. Although Aniston and Theroux are no longer together, the pair said in their joint statement that they intend to continue to foster their \u2018cherished friendship\u2019.\n\n\u2018In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,\u2019 the statement read. \u2018This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\u2019\n\nMe: *reading about Jennifer Aniston & Justin Theroux split* awww that sucks\n\nAlso me: planning Jennifer Aniston & Brad Pitt's second wedding \u2014 Ally Reid (@ashallann) February 16, 2018\n\nThe notoriously private pair went on to say that they only decided to go public about their split to stop any speculation before it could start. Aniston and Theroux added that they wanted to be sure fans got \u2018the truth directly\u2019, rather than reading and believing gossip.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd...\u2764\ufe0f\u270c\ufe0f A post shared by @ justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT\n\n\u2018Normally we would do this privately, but given the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we want to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else\u2019s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.\u2019\n\nAlthough they parted ways at the end of 2017, Aniston and Theroux jetted together to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico with Jason Bateman, his family and other close friends. The estranged husband and wife celebrated New Year\u2019s Eve together in spite of their apparent relationship struggles.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd...2018 @gansettandtrout aka Darkknight A post shared by @ justintheroux on Dec 31, 2017 at 11:37pm PST\n\nThe couple met in 2008 on the set of Tropic Thunder, however, they didn\u2019t begin dating until 2011. They tied the knot nearly four years later in a surprise ceremony at their home in August 2015. Guests believed they were there to attend a birthday celebration for Theroux.\n\nHistory of Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt\u2019s relationship\n\nJennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt reportedly began dating after meeting on a blind date their respective agents set up in 1998. They quickly became the \u2018it\u2019 couple of the early 2000s, with their every move making headlines. Two years after they met, Aniston and Pitt, 54, married.\n\nMy reaction to Jennifer Aniston separation news\ufffd\ufffdbut realized both her and Brad Pitt are single\ufffd\ufffd pic.twitter.com/RJj9UWxgxg \u2014 Hani Lee (@HaniLee1) February 15, 2018\n\nTheir marriage ended on January 5, 2005. The couple announced that they had \u2018formally\u2019 separated. After their divorce announcement, fans couldn\u2019t help but wonder what went wrong.\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie got together shortly after his divorce from Jennifer Aniston, which raised eyebrows among fans of the actress known first and foremost for her role as Rachel Green in Friends. It wasn\u2019t until years into their relationship that Jolie, 42, admitted that she and Pitt had fallen in love on the set of Mr & Mrs Smith, which they began filming in 2003.\n\n\u2018Because of the film, we ended up being brought together to do all these crazy things, and I think we found this strange friendship and partnership that kind of just suddenly happened. I think a few months in I realized, \u201cGod, I can\u2019t wait to get to work.\u201d\u2026Anything we had to do with each other, we just found a lot of joy in it together and a lot of real teamwork. We just became kind of a pair,\u2019 she revealed in an issue of Vogue.\n\nIn case you all forgot: Brad Pitt fell in love with another woman and begun a relationship with her while he was still married to Jennifer Aniston. He left her to be with someone else. Why would anyone want her to get back together with him? \u2014 Alina (@__LinaGarcia) February 16, 2018\n\nNot many believed them, but the pair always insisted they waited to get romantic, with Jolie telling the fashion magazine they were merely \u2018very, very good friends\u2019 until after Pitt and Aniston ended their marriage.\n\n\u2018It took until, really, the end of the shoot for us, I think to realize that it might mean something more than we\u2019d earlier allowed ourselves to believe. And both knowing that the reality of that was a big thing, something that was going to take a lot of serious consideration,\u2019 she said.\n\nIn 2005, Pitt joined Jolie on a trip to Ethiopia to adopt her second child. He formally adopted the little girl, Zahara, and her older brother Maddox, in 2006. That same year he and Jolie welcomed their first biological child together, a daughter named Shiloh.\n\nJolie adopted son Pax in 2007, with Pitt adopting the child as his own in 2008. That year the couple welcomed two more biological children, twins Knox and Vivienne. They married at the urging of their children in 2014.\n\nPlot twist: she gets back with Brad Pitt and is step mom to Angelina\u2019s kids #JenniferAniston pic.twitter.com/z60mXi2Jb0 \u2014 Jerry Don (@JerryDonut1) February 16, 2018\n\nThe ceremony took place in their French chateau. At the time, Jolie and Pitt had been engaged for close to two years.\n\nThe pair previously said that they would not marry until it was legal for all people to be married.\n\n\u2018We both have been married before, so it\u2019s not marriage that\u2019s necessarily kept some people together,\u2019 Jolie told Vogue. \u2018We are legally bound to our children, not to each other, and I think that\u2019s the most important thing.\u2019\n\nAfter 11 years together, Jolie and Pitt shocked fans by announcing their divorce. Jolie\u2019s attorney, Robert Offer, told AP that her decision to end the marriage was \u2018for the health of the family\u2019.\n\nPitt fired back in a statement of his own, which he released to People magazine, in which he claimed he was \u2018saddened\u2019 by the whole ordeal. He went on to say that his focus, at the time, was on his children.\n\nNot long after they went public about their divorce, reports surfaced suggesting that Pitt was being investigated for child abuse linked to an incident on a private plane. People reported that the Los Angeles Police Department and the L.A. County Department of Children and Family Services was looking into an anonymous report that Pitt had been \u2018verbally abusive\u2019 and gotten \u2018physical\u2019 with one of his children, which later was revealed to be Maddox.\n\nThe incident in question reportedly occurred on September 14. Pitt is said to have been drinking at the time. His entire family was present during the alleged altercation.\n\nTo the people feeling sorry 4 #JenniferAniston\n\nShe is successful,clever,beautiful & seems like she would be a blast. She has dated a string of hotties including, #BradPitt #JustinTheroux etc & has probably done all this without having to change a dirty diaper... #IWantToBeHer pic.twitter.com/BxK6fTnN7N \u2014 Nolene Dougan (@NoleneDougan) February 16, 2018\n\nLAPD later denied the report, stating that they had \u2018no criminal investigation\u2019 open on the actor at the time. People later amended their report to say that DCFS was the only agency investigating Pitt. TMZ later released an article stating that the FBI was also investigating the incident.\n\nThe FBI responded to a request for comment from Us Weekly, stating that they were still determining what action, if any, should be taken.\n\n\u2018In response to your inquiry regarding allegations within the special aircraft jurisdiction of the United States; specifically, an aircraft carrying Mr Brad Pitt and his children, the FBI is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued,\u2019 the statement read.\n\nIn the end, Pitt was not prosecuted in the incident. He and Jolie reached a custody agreement, and he was eventually able to have his first visit with his children.\n\nNo word from Pitt nor Aniston about whether reconciliation is on the horizon, though it has not stopped rampant speculation, with one report even saying they were planning on making their debut as a couple at this year's Oscars.", "images":
