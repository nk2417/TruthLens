I want nothing but the best for him and will continue to support him as a friend that I have immense love and respect for.\n\n\u2018As for the future, whatever\u2019s meant to be will always be. xG.\u2019\n\nBefore he dated the supermodel, Zayn dated Perrie for four years, and was engaged to the 24-year-old for two.\n\nShe later revealed he split with her over a \u2018simple text message\u2019 \u2013 something he has since denied.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
