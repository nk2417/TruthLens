While we don\u2019t see Stone herself as the anti-puppy type, her casting comes as no surprise\u2014not only because the actress has spent the better part of her career proving she can drive almost any film in a starring role, but also because we can already imagine her in that signature color-blocked bob.\n\nStone has never shied away from a scene-stealing dye job. Take 2009\u2019s Zombieland, for which she dipped her natural blonde locks a dark chocolate. While she\u2019s often thought of as a redhead, she\u2019s actually only donned the fiery color for fun and film, trying everything from the warm cinnamon of Irrational Man to the auburn waves in Gangster Squad. Even as a blonde she\u2019s left no shade unturned: The Help may be significant for those wild curls, but we\u2019ll remember it for her pitch-perfect strawberry hue. Spiderman 2 saw her go paler still, but her part in Birdman took the peroxide even further with a shock of near-white layers. Now, as Cruella, she\u2019ll wear both the visual equivalent of the absence of color and every single color at once. Above, a look at seven films that prove that if anyone is up for a hair-color challenge, it\u2019s Emma Stone.", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914dee23f9887c0e0e031e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/01-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6902341b8d2485587b8de59f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/691de52c1285351eba281434/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df058aa89a00d54298e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/03-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/691b9f96da942818c7375433/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/691de779b647aca817f1d538/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914def4fe15261130212f8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/02-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68fdf8322ce499027c6c2a74/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6901466ee196acb44206cb62/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/691c994f75750d1015c0079d/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/us/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/691c9de29a15d6c77521ecbc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6740fb4431390df05dc3a16a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/69165c072cfe3809fd23852e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6916192b6b64d990e3313359/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/691cb66d2578744d879b23d4/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/emma-stone-hair-color-cruella-de-vil", "title": "Emma Stone\u2019s Next Role Will Have the Most Extreme Hair Color Yet", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Vogue", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "The actress\u2014who has just been cast as Cruella de Vil\u2014has never shied away from a scene-stealing dye job.", "id": "58914df5fb0604bf1f5c22cd", "keywords": "emma stone,hair color", "news_keywords": "emma stone,hair color", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=289380413, app-argument=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id289380413?pt=45076&ct=VOG_Smart_Banner&mt=8", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "58914df5fb0604bf1f5c22cd", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The actress\u2014who has just been cast as Cruella de Vil\u2014has never shied away from a scene-stealing dye job.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg\"}", "og": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Emma Stone\u2019s Next Role Will Have the Most Extreme Hair Color Yet", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/emma-stone-hair-color-cruella-de-vil"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2016-04-26T15:55:12.000Z", "modified_time": "2016-04-26T15:55:12.000Z", "author": "Vogue"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Emma Stone\u2019s Next Role Will Have the Most Extreme Hair Color Yet"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/58914df185b3959618473114/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/04-emma-stone-hair-color.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1461686112.0, "source": "http://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
