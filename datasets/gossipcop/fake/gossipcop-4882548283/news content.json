Here We Go Again\n\nThe pair fell in love after appearing in the first movie together, back in 2008. Their relationship didn\u2019t last, and Seyfried is now happily married to Tom Sadoski - with whom she has a child. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT She admitted in a new interview that Sadoski was \u201cjealous\u201d of her on-screen relationship with Cooper, but it\u2019s nothing to worry about. \u201cI think he has the same kind of issues that I would have if we were hanging out with his ex-girlfriend from long ago,\u201d she told The Mirror.\n\nAmanda Seyfried reunites with Dominic Cooper in Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again\n\nSeyfried is now married to Tom Sadoski\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s always like, \u2018I\u2019m so in love with this person, so that person must be so in love with her too\u2019. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT \u201cI assume everyone\u2019s in love with Tommy because I\u2019m in love with him. I assume that everybody sees him the way I do.\u201d Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT She added: \u201cI\u2019d guess he assumed Dominic is in love with me the way he\u2019s in love with me. And it\u2019s just not the case. \u201cIt\u2019s sweet. I\u2019d rather he be jealous than completely fine with it. He\u2019s been great.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very supportive and he loves this movie, and [he and Dominic] got along absolutely fine when we were shooting.\u201d Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again also brings back Meryl Streep, Christine Baranski, Julie Walters, Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard and Colin Firth. Baranski appeared to fuel rumours that Streep\u2019s Donna is dead in the sequel, as she said at the UK press conference that the key players are all dealing with \u201closs\u201d.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
