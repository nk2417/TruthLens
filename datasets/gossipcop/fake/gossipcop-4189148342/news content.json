She gives her consent and thanks him for bringing the line to her before recording and releasing it. It\u2019s still unclear just how much Swift knew about the ultimate phrasing of the line, but it\u2019s obvious she agrees its sentiment is acceptable. (If you\u2019d rather read than watch, The Fader has transcribed the footage. You\u2019ll miss legendary producer Rick Rubin hanging out on a couch in the background, though.)\n\nHere is the entire conversation Taylor & Kanye had, judge for yourself. pic.twitter.com/InTjvPGKe3 \u2014 ShadyPopMusic (@ShadyPopMusic) July 18, 2016\n\nAt the beginning of this year, Swift and West had almost entirely reconciled after he famously interrupted her at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. That all changed when West released \u201cFamous\u201d and the rest of The Life of Pablo in February. Swift sent out a statement condemning the line and West\u2019s misogyny a few days after it was first played in public, and West used a series of tweets to claim that Swift had approved the line well before it was released. When she won the Grammy for Album of the Year a few days later, she used her speech to allude to unnamed enemies who \u201cwill try to undercut your success.\u201d It was widely assumed she meant West.\n\nWhen Kardashian appeared on the cover of GQ last month, she confirmed that Swift had approved the line and suggested that her conversation with West had been caught on camera, only to get blocked by Swift\u2019s legal team once they learned about its existence. It seems like the existence of a letter from Swift\u2019s attorney couldn\u2019t keep Kardashian silent forever, and now we\u2019re left to wait and see how Swift reacts to having the rug pulled out from under her. Between this and the Nils Sjoberg fiasco, she\u2019s had a pretty rough week.\n\nUpdate July 18th, 12:20AM ET: Taylor Swift has responded to Kim Kardashian West\u2019s Snapchat with her own posts on Instagram and Twitter. The picture \u2014 a block of text claiming that West never played her the song or said he would call her \u201cthat bitch\u201d \u2014 was captioned with \u201cThat moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet.\u201d Swift says that the video falsely paints her as a liar, when she wasn\u2019t actually played the song, making Kim and Kanye\u2019s actions \u201ccharacter assassination.\u201d\n\nThat moment when Kanye West secretly records your phone call, then Kim posts it on the Internet.
