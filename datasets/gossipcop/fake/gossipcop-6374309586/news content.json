She\u2019s interrupted by a group of women, and when she turns back to the mirror, she realizes she can\u2019t see her reflection anymore.\n\nThis realization sets off a string of impromptu \u201cLa La Land\u201d-esque dance moves \u2014 some of which are painfully awkward to watch.\n\nAbout a minute and a half in, things get crazy: The singer whips off the bottom of her gown, revealing a sassy, shorter version of her fringy frock.\n\nThe weird dance moves and the dramatic disrobing aren\u2019t even the most buzzed-about bits of the video, though. Critics say Swift\u2019s video is a ripoff of Spike Jonze\u2019s 2016 Kenzo commercial (starring \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d actress Margaret Qualley).\n\n\u201cAnybody else notice that the @taylorswift13 \u2018Delicate\u2019 music video ripped off Spike Jonze\u2019s Kenzo video? It\u2019s almost beat-for-beat, just with worse dancing,\u201d one whistleblower tweets.\n\n\u201cTaylor Swift\u2019s \u2018Delicate\u2019 video is a poor man\u2019s version of Spike Jonze\u2019s ad for Kenzo,\u201d tweets another.\n\nNaturally, Swift\u2019s die-hard fans couldn\u2019t care less about the Kenzo controversy.\n\n\u201c@taylorswift13 dancing in a storm in her best dress because she\u2019s fearless and it doesn\u2019t get better than this in the \u2018Delicate\u2019 video is everything,\u201d tweets a loyalist.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/COMP-carnivaldeath_1762746067738_hpMain_4x5-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/02/button_3_bg-2.png?w=206", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/view3.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/taylor-swift-feature.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/kevin-spacey-reveals-homeless-living-115762000.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=NYPOST&cj=1&cv=3.6"], "top_img": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/taylor-swift-feature.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2018/03/12/taylor-swift-dramatically-rips-off-dress-in-controversial-new-music-video/", "title": "Taylor Swift rips off dress in controversial new music video", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
