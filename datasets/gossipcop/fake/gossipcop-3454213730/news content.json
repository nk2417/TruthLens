WTF.\n\nEd with Taylor and Selena, one of which he\u2019s been romantically linked to, last year (Picture: Getty)\n\nEd told Rolling Stone of his wingwoman: \u2018Taylor\u2019s world is celebrity. I was this 22-year-old awkward British kid going on tour with the biggest artist in America, who has all these famous mates.\n\n\u2018It was very easy [wooing the ladies]. I would often find myself in situations just kind of waking up and looking over and being like, \u201cHow the f**k did that happen?\u201d.\u2019\n\nGushing further about Taylor, Ed added: \u2018She would be there if everything ended for me. Taylor is kind of an anomaly in that sense.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s omnipresent because she\u2019s the most famous woman in the world, so she can\u2019t make the decision to not be in the press. I always stick up for Taylor.\u2019\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Ed hinted he and his guardian angel will do a joint tour together and \u2018trade songs\u2019 during gigs, as Jay Z and Justin Timberlake did a few years ago.\n\nNo one is trying to deny Ed and Taylor are BFFs (Picture: Anna Webber/Getty Images for Atlantic Records)\n\nTaylor, who was also interviewed by the mag for the same issue, backed this up \u2014 and claimed she and Ed are still very close, despite their geographical divide.\n\n\u2018We\u2019ve gotten matching Scottish folds, made each other arts and crafts Christmas presents, vacationed with our families, and had each other\u2019s backs,\u2019 Swift said.\n\n\u2018He is the James Taylor to my Carole King and I can\u2019t imagine a time when he wouldn\u2019t be.\u2019\n\nEd is now in a serious relationship with Cherry Seaborn, and we expect she won\u2019t want a repeat of the shenanigans on his and Taylor\u2019s last tour together.\n\nLike
