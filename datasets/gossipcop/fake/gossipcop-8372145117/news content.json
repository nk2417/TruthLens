Thomas reveals he is ashamed of cheap remarks his dad has since made about Suits star Meghan, 36, calling her a \u201chot commodity\u201d and saying Harry \u201cbetter get on it\u201d.\n\nView 5 Images Meghan's nephew Thomas Dooleyhas apologised for his family's behaviour (Image: Coleman-Rayner)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nHe is also dismayed by reports that his aunt Samantha, 51, Meghan\u2019s half-sister, is set to reveal a tell all book on the Suits actress. Called The Diary of Princess Pushy\u2019s Sister, it is reportedly set to suggest the Suits actress is only with Prince Harry, 33, for fame.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nIn an exclusive interview, Thomas, 26, says: \u201cMy dad and aunt are crazy. I feel terrible for Meghan.\n\n\u201cMe and my brother Tyler have nothing to do with our dad. His behaviour since Meghan began dating Prince Harry has been completely appalling.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\u201cI want people to know I have nothing to do with it and just apologise to her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a shame her own family are making up stories about her.\u201d\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nThomas, who lives in a small mountain town in \u00adCalifornia, says he longs to see Meghan again.\n\n\u201cShe is a lovely, warm and caring person and she seems super happy with Prince Harry. I believe it was fate they fell for each other and I wish them both the best,\u201d he says.\n\nHe said he and brother Tyler, 24, \u201chave always been supportive of her and always cherished what she was doing with her life.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\u201cShe worked really hard to get where she is and she has always presented herself very well, so it\u2019s well deserved.\n\n\u201cI would like to see my aunt again \u2013 hopefully even before she got married . But if that\u2019s the chance I get to see her, I would love it.\u201d\n\nView 5 Images Meghan's nephew says he is ashamed of dad Thomas Jnr, pictured (Image: Coleman-Rayner)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nThe Royals fan says he was \u201cup the entire night watching Prince William marry Catherine on TV. It was very nice and I was glued to it\u201d.\n\nThomas reckons Meghan would be proud of what has happened to the little boy she so loved looking after. Now married to Ronnie, 41, he says: \u201cMy earliest memory of her was when we were at Grandpa\u2019s house and she was playing with us.\n\n\u201cMeghan probably knew I was gay even as a kid. We used to play with Barbie dolls together.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\u201cI think almost everybody who knew me had an inkling. I told my mom when I was 13, but she already knew.\u201d\n\nHe says his 50-year-old dad, who left his mum and now lives in Oregon, struggled to accept his sexuality.\n\nAnd he tells how Thomas Jnr\u2019s bust-up with Meghan\u2019s dad Thomas Snr, 72, more than 10 years ago led to their side of the family being cut off from her.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 5 Images Meghan as a baby with half-brother Tom (Image: Coleman-Rayner)\n\n\u201cMy grandpa lives in Mexico and he and Dad do not speak whatsoever,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThey have not had a relationship for over a decade.\n\n\u201cGrandpa wants nothing to do with my dad. Tyler and I have no issues with our grandpa. We speak on the phone every now and then.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we made the decision to stop seeing Meghan and grandpa, because we always really liked our family.\n\n\u201cBut tensions were really high between Grandpa and Dad, and eventually our lives took different paths and we fell out of touch.\u201d\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nMeghan met the Queen for the first time 10 days ago when she and Harry had afternoon tea with her at Buckingham Palace .\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nThe landmark event \u2013 18 months into the pair\u2019s relationship \u2013 has led to increased speculation that the Prince, who needs his grandmother\u2019s consent to marry, is now preparing to pop the question.\n\nView 5 Images Meghan has met the Queen and may soon be a royal herself (Image: Getty Images North America)\n\nThomas read about the Royal meeting with amazement.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\u201cIt shows the Queen is being accepting of who Meghan is and what she\u2019s done with her life and I think that\u2019s amazing,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt shows she\u2019s been accepted as a good companion for Prince Harry. It\u2019s a huge step. But I know she would have stayed calm and collected.\n\n\u201cShe would have had a nice little chat. I\u2019m thinking it would have gone really well.\u201d\n\nArticle continues below\n\nThomas hopes Meghan may one day \u201cstrap on some skis\u201d and visit him at the Domino\u2019s branch he and his husband run in Mammoth Lakes, California.\n\nAsked if he expects a wedding invite, he says: \u201cYou never know but it would totally be her choice.\n\nLaughing, he adds: \u201cBut if she did need to invite anyone out of our family, we would be the safest.\u201d", "images": ["https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12965190.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/1_Samantha-Markle-on-GMB.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/trust-project.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11386087.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/1_PROD-ELLEs-6th-Annual-Women-In-Television-Dinner-Arrivals.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13028647.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/3_Preparations-for-Royal-Wedding-of-Harry-and-Meghan.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12570753.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/MAIN-THP_CHP_210518SLUG_2082JPG.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article16168652.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/0_Anniversary-main2.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12287571.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/PROD-Meghan-Markle-and-Trevor-Engelson-attend-COACH-Legacy-Photo-Exhibit.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11602866.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/BLP_MDG_infocentre_1201JPG.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article9160081.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/Suits-Season-4.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11386107.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PROD-BESTPIX-Invictus-Games-Toronto-2017-Day-31.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12562854.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/Meghan-Marklerf.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/nav-web-static/release-v41-14493b7c888038a7d89b99cb3a7937c2b71eaebe/public/logo-reach.png", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11380259.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/EMB-PAY-PROD-Meghan-Markles-nephew-Thomas-Dooley-26-poses-with-his-husband-Ronnie-Tanner-41-outside-their-Do.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11386107.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PROD-BESTPIX-Invictus-Games-Toronto-2017-Day-31.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11380267.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_EMB-PAY-PROD-Prince-Harrys-alleged-new-girlfriend-Megan-Markles-brother-Thomas-Markle-II-and-his-son-Tyler-Mark.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/ipso.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11380258.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/EMB-PAY-PROD-Never-before-seen-pics-show-Meghan-Markles-family-with-red-hair-just-like-her-boyfriend-Prince-H.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/assets/mirror/logos/masthead-mirror-default.svg"], "top_img": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11386107.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PROD-BESTPIX-Invictus-Games-Toronto-2017-Day-31.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karleigh Smith", "Patrick Hill", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/meghan-markles-nephew-reveals-heartache-11386023", "title": "Meghan Markle's nephew reveals heartache at the family rift that tore them apart", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"page_id": 6149699161, "app_id": 123792601022133, "pages": 1814357575554395}, "description": "Thomas Dooley and Prince Harry\u2019s girlfriend were once close and she used to love babysitting him as a little boy, but a family feud between the Suits star's father and her half-brother has meant they haven't seen one another in years", "author": "Patrick Hill", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "Googlebot-News": "noarchive", "referrer": "unsafe-URL", "keywords": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry", "news_keywords": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry", "allowTaboolaDeepDive": "true", "vf": {"00000000-0000-4000-8000-67e599051dc3": "mirror-prod-11386023"}, "og": {"title": "Meghan Markle's nephew reveals heartache at the family rift that tore them apart", "description": "Thomas Dooley and Prince Harry\u2019s girlfriend were once close and she used to love babysitting him as a little boy, but a family feud between the Suits star's father and her half-brother has meant they haven't seen one another in years", "url": "http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/meghan-markles-nephew-reveals-heartache-11386023", "site_name": "Daily Mirror", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11386107.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PROD-BESTPIX-Invictus-Games-Toronto-2017-Day-31.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-21T21:34:50Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-29T09:47:47Z", "author": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/patrick-hill/", "section": "Celebrity News", "tag": "Prince Harry"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@DailyMirror", "creator": "@patrick_hill_", "title": "Meghan Markle's nephew reveals heartache at the family rift that tore them apart -
