She is instantly aghast.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been feeling emotional lately, really I haven\u2019t,\u201d she wails, fluttering her hands like Rachel Green in distress, except that this time it isn\u2019t funny.\n\nOther than the 24-hour security detail guarding her safety, Aniston is all alone in the modest rental where she has camped out while dealing with the end of her marriage to Brad Pitt\u2014and its devastating aftermath, which has been far worse than the actual split. The last few months have brought an endless nightmare of hurtful headlines about her soon-to-be-ex-husband, along with blatantly fraudulent stories about herself, in the tabloids and supermarket gossip magazines. Pursued around the clock by the rabid paparazzi she refers to as \u201cratzies,\u201d she is ambushed even on her own deck by photographers who lurk on the beach outside her door, spying on her every move.\n\nAs she squeezes her eyes shut in an effort to stop crying, the scene provides a painful contrast with the last time we met. Little more than a year ago, I interviewed Pitt at the Beverly Hills mansion that he and Aniston had just spent two years renovating. A testament to both his passion for architecture and the couple\u2019s hopeful vision of their shared future, the beautiful old house awaited only a baby in a bassinet to complete a picture-perfect existence.\n\nWhen I left, they both walked me out to my car. Their home, its windows lit and welcoming, glowed in the twilight. As we said our good-byes, Pitt and Aniston leaned together in the driveway, arms twined around each other. Her head rested trustingly on his buff chest, still pumped up from his rigorous training to play the warrior Achilles in Troy.\n\nThey seemed the most fortunate couple imaginable\u2014two beautiful superstars who had hit the jackpot, earning not only fame and riches but also an enduring love. Their fans had long been captivated by the romance of America\u2019s Sweetheart and the Sexiest Man in the World, and now they were ready to begin a thrilling new chapter. Aniston\u2019s 10-year run on Friends was ending, and she and Pitt had vowed to start a family when her stupendously successful television series was finished.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6904d5c724b0aec8ded951c4/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57d2e2a05475d07256a8b2ef/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/celebrity-divorces-lawyers.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fbde150b3b961d91154947/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c434169027501c6efb7f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss06-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c4308fbf768838dc56e3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss04-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691cd91f9f3eb60315ac3531/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c42c169027501c6efb27/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss01-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c43c169027501c6efbd7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss09-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c42c8fbf768838dc56b7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss02-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4ec6a8fbf768838dc619b/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/ss10-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690ba383ec5ef29213749186/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c4338fbf768838dc570f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ss05-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690b9ba3d0d7aa0f3c9fb7e4/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c438169027501c6efbab/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss07-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691b63b86201973f77db4e40/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6912033f02774bc2b727aee4/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6904b792447a00332ceb4fd3/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690a5ee0da787343f1849201/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c4388fbf768838dc573b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss08-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690ba04e625f5a8c4860326f/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c4338fbf768838dc570f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ss05-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leslie Bennetts"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/09/aniston200509", "title": "The Unsinkable Jennifer Aniston", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Leslie Bennetts", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "The whole world watched as her \u201cperfect\u201d marriage fell apart.
