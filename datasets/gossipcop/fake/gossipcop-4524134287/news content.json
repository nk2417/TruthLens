She said: \u201cThey played me about 20 different songs, and when I heard this one I was like, \u2018Oh, this is relevant!\u2019 Alex and I were just getting to know each other. And I was like, \u2018Oh, my God, could this be? Could this be us?\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrities Dating Athletes They sure like their players!
