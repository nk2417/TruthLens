Oliver Hudson joked about his sister Kate Hudson\u2018s rumored romance with Brad Pitt on Instagram on Friday, January 20.\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Unlikely Celebrity Couples They dated?! From Tom Cruise and Cher to Taylor Kinney and Lady Gaga, some celebrity couples don't always make sense to the untrained eye. Check out these unexpected celebrity romances.\n\nThe Rules of Engagement alum, 40, shared a photo of a recent Star magazine cover, which claimed Kate, 37, and Pitt, 53, are \u201cgetting serious\u201d and have moved in together. Oliver was clearly amused by the tabloid rumors and wrote a lengthy (and sarcastic) response to shut down the speculation.\n\n\u201cYeah and it\u2019s been hell!! He\u2019s messy as s\u2013t!\u201d Oliver captioned his Instagram post. \u201cHe drinks out of the f\u2013king carton and leaves the door open when he\u2019s taking a dump!! And this is when he\u2019s at MY house!!! He\u2019s already calling me brother and has driven a wedge between myself and my real brother Wyatt who now won\u2019t speak to me. He insists my kids call him uncle B and lost my youngest at the Santa Monica pier for 2 days.. thank god for amber alert.\u201d\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Celebs Fight Back on Twitter!

But ALL DAY!! Like at 3pm! And Pa [Kurt Russell] just keeps saying \u2018All right!! It\u2019s Brad Pitt!!\u2019 Anyway not going well.. so BP.. it\u2019s time to move out man.. I need my life back dog.. I\u2019ll smoke one more bowl and then get the f\u2013k out.. we thank you.. oh and I found your medical bracelet so I\u2019ll get that back to you.. ok..\u201d\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Brad Pitt\u2019s Us Weekly Covers: 1995 to Now!

Days before Oliver\u2019s Instagram post, a paparazzo asked Hawn, 71, if she was \u201cready to have Brad as a son-in-law,\u201d causing the Snatched actress to burst out laughing, according to a video posted by The Sun. \u201cYou did make me laugh,\u201d Hawn admitted.", "images":
