News reports that the pair was seen dining at LA hot spot Craig\u2019s earlier this week.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely more than just a friendly outing because the girls were seated close to their men.,\u201d says one witness.\n\nWhile Blake and Kendall were with another couple, onlookers say there was no mistaking the chemistry between them.\n\n\u201cYou could tell Blake was more into Kendall by the way he was staring and smiling at her. He looked very into her,\u201d the source adds.\n\nWell, it sounds like Kendall might want to enjoy being the center of Blake\u2019s attention while she can.\n\nTip-off is right around the corner, and she\u2019s apparently persona non-grata at the games.", "images": ["http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/kendall-jenner-sizzles-706x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/282b9db9-f970-47ab-aa86-b5db88e06692_1763082694-80x80.avif", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1114_christinaricci_header-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/kendall-jenner-sizzles-scaled.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1252373567-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/10/1017_haileesteinfeld_header-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/kendall-jenner-sizzles-720x540.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/RHOC-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-320x240.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-14-at-12.06.55-PM-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2225798881-2-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/07/0708_sophieturner_header-80x80.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/kendall-jenner-sizzles-scaled.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/09/kendall-jenner-banned-from-clippers-games-due-to-blake-griffin-r/", "title": "Kendall Jenner: Banned From Clippers Games Due to Blake Griffin Relationship?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kendall Jenner: Banned From Clippers Games Due to Blake Griffin Relationship?", "description": "Though they haven't made an official announcement yet, it's pretty clear Kendall Jenner and Blake Griffin are dating.
