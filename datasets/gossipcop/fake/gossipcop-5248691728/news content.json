Back then, with Scott Disick trying to get a rise out of Kourtney by engaging in his World Sex Tour, the story was that Kourtney had decided to put an end to Scott\u2019s shenanigans by getting married to Younes for Keeping Up With The Kardashians\u2018 cameras.\n\nThis time, the gossip comes from OK!\u2019s Australian edition, and alleges that Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s secret wedding to Younes came on an undisclosed Mexican beach. The magazine says that apparently, \u201cwith the world watching for the arrival of her sisters Kim, Khloe and Kylie Jenner\u2019s new babies, it\u2019s been the perfect time for low-key Kourt to sneak under the radar and say \u2018I do\u2019 in secret.\u201d\n\nHowever, their story trips up by going on to claim \u2014 in the very next sentence \u2014 that Kris Jenner is \u201cdesperate to air\u201d the supposedly secret ceremony on KUWTK. And just a bit later, the story then doubles down on its contradiction by further claiming that Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s secret wedding was atypical for the Kardashians in that it was only Kourtney and Younes and \u201ca celebrant on the beach, with no cameras around.\u201d\n\nFurther adding to the delightful deception is the magazine\u2019s cover, which does appear to depict a beach wedding ceremony, and which comes complete with privacy-ensuring canopies\u2026\n\n\u2026but which photo, as the good people at Gossip Cop point out, actually comes from Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s 2015 wedding. (Plus, there are way more than just three people in the cover photo, meaning the magazine is banking on its readers never putting the article\u2019s discrepancies together.)\n\nOn the other hand, KUWTK viewers were recently treated to Kourtney finding out how to treat herself to a little alone time with Younes. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely learned from my past relationship, where I really wouldn\u2019t travel without the kids,\u201d she told the show\u2019s cameras, when debating whether to jet off to Egypt for a kid-free vacation with her boyfriend. \u201cAnd I think it is important to take time, especially because my relationship is important to me.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s entirely possible that 2018 will be the year we find out about Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s secret wedding \u2014 the real one, that is \u2014 after it\u2019s already happened, in a grand Kris Jenner-organized reveal. But, if 2017 taught us anything, it\u2019s just as likely that Kourtney will slouch her way into a why-not marriage with Scott Disick.\n\n(Photo credits: Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s secret wedding via Instagram, Splash News)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kourtney-Kardashians-secret-wedding-3-490x606.jpg", "https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kourtney-Kardashians-secret-wedding-2-490x735.jpg", "https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kourtney-Kardashians-secret-wedding-2.jpg", "https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Black-Ink-Compton-1.jpg", "https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Moniece-Slaughters-sex-tape-2.jpg", "https://c.statcounter.com/9846729/0/9a0f0d6e/0/", "https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cropped-starcasmlogo-2.png", "https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LHHH-A1-3.png"], "top_img": "https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kourtney-Kardashians-secret-wedding-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://starcasm.net/kourtney-kardashians-secret-wedding/", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s secret wedding allegedly still had a camera crew", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.166.0", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s secret wedding allegedly still had a camera crew", "url": "https://starcasm.net/kourtney-kardashians-secret-wedding/", "description": "It\u2019s Kardashian pregnancy and wedding rumors galore today: Just hours after another round of rumors that Kylie Jenner\u2019s gone into early labor comes a high-profile story claiming that Ko\u2026", "site_name": "Starcasm", "image": {"identifier": "https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kourtney-Kardashians-secret-wedding-2.jpg", "width": 490, "height": 735}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-15T15:02:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-15T15:03:49+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s secret wedding allegedly still had a camera crew"}, "image": "https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kourtney-Kardashians-secret-wedding-2.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://starcasm.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-Starcasm_site_icon-270x270.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516028573.0, "source": "http://starcasm.net", "summary": ""}
