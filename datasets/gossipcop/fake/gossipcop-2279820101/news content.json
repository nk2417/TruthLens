It was more about the stress and pressure of a big red carpet. He just wasn\u2019t quite there yet. Kanye has been doing okay. He\u2019s made a lot of good progress and is in a much better place.\u201d\n\nView 6 Images The pair pose on the red carpet at the 2016 Met Gala (Image: Wireimage)\n\nView 6 Images Kanye will remain in Los Angeles (Image: KimKardashian/Instagram)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nThey added: \u201cHe\u2019s still very much enjoying his time off from public events.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be staying back in LA with their kids [North and Saint].
