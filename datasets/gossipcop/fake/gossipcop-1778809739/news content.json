And I think it\u2019s important that in all couples, the mom gives the husband as much attention as the kids.\u201d\n\nAs Kardashian and Kanye West\u2019s family blossoms (they are also the parents of daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 2), so does their relationship. \u201cHe\u2019s taught me to have more of an opinion,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019ve taught him to be a bit more calm or cautious.

I just said, \u2018Which one is the healthiest? Pick the healthiest one,\u2019 and that was a girl.\u201d\n\nBut Kardashian wasn\u2019t a momzilla with her gestational carrier. \u201cI straight-up told her, \u2018Look, I ate doughnuts every single day. If you want doughnuts and ice cream, go for it. Do whatever you feel. I\u2019m not going to be picky like that. That\u2019s just ridiculous,\u2019\u201d she told the publication.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Babies of 2018 A new bundle of joy!
