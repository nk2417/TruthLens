Bruce Glikas/FilmMagic\n\n\u201cI grew up in this entertainment industry at a very young age and when I was around 13-years-old I started to find boys and girls attractive,\u201d Carter, who had high-profile relationships with Lindsay Lohan and Hilary Duff when he was younger, wrote. \u201cThere were years that went by that I thought about, but it wasn\u2019t until I was 17-years-old, after a few relationships with girls, I had an experience with a male that I had an attraction to who I also worked with and grew up with.\n\n\u201cTo me music has always been my temple,\u201d he continued. \u201cMusic will ALWAYS be what transcends us and myself. The studio has always been my safe haven. But the ultimate goal for me is to be satisfied. I never want to be a figure of disappointment. The best quote to sum \u2018I\u2019ve never felt as though I didn\u2019t belong, I just acted as though I did.\u2019 \u2014Boy George.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Aaron Carter Says Medical Condition Is Keeping Him Skinny\n\nIt\u2019s been a dramatic summer for Carter. He was arrested on July 15 on suspicion of driving under the influence and possession of marijuana. He denies that he was under the influence while driving, claiming that he was experiencing car troubles. His girlfriend, Madison Parker, was with him that night and was also arrested.\n\nIn June, Carter was briefly hospitalized for exhaustion and spoke out against critics who had been body-shaming his thin frame, which he says is the result of a hiatal hernia that he was diagnosed with when he was 19.", "images":
