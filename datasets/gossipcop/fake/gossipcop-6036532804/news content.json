She\u2019s been won over,\" a source told the paper.\n\n\u201cThe timing of this looks very bad for Taylor. There was an obvious connection with Tom at the Met Gala \u2013 you can see that in the video of them dancing together.\"\n\nThey continued: \u201cHer people are insistent that no one else was involved in the split with Calvin, which is most likely the case.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\u201cBut it feels pretty disrespectful to be moving on to someone so public so quickly.\u201d\n\nView 8 Images Tom Hiddleston at The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Benefit (Image: REX)\n\nThe new couple also spent the night together before the gala event.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nBoth were guests at Anna Wintour's private dinner on the eve of the fashion bash, with Taylor spotted gazing at the actor in the hallway of the New York residence as he headed home with actor Idris Elba.\n\nAnother insider claimed after the Met Gala it was \"no surprise\" these two have got together.\n\n\u201cShe wasn't single at the time of the Gala but the chemistry between them was very obvious, so it's not really surprising that he wants to get together with her now,\u201d an insider told Reveal magazine.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 8 Images Caylor ended their romance earlier this month (Image: Getty)\n\n\u201cTom called her right after the news of her break-up came out and they talked for almost an hour,\u201d they continued.\n\n\u201cShe barely hung up the phone when a bouquet of flowers arrived at her door \u2013 Tom managed to order them while he was on the phone with her.\u201d\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nCalvin and Swift's 15-month romance came to an abrupt end at the start of June, just weeks after she had gushed about how amazing Calvin was as she picked up an award at the iHeart Radio Awards in April.\n\nView 8 Images The DJ congratulates his girlfriend at the iHeart Radio Awards (Image: Getty)\n\nView 8 Images The PDA moment came just months before the split (Image: Getty)\n\nArticle continues below\n\nShe said at the time: \"For the first time I had the most amazing person to come home to when the spotlight went out and when the crowds were all gone.\n\n\"So I want to thank my boyfriend Adam for that and I love you guys so much.\"", "images": ["http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/trust-project.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article7895374.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Taylor-Swift-Tom-Hiddleston.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article7895375.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Taylor-Swift-Tom-Hiddleston.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article7684622.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Taylor-Swift-iHeartRadio-awards-2016.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/nav-web-static/release-v41-14493b7c888038a7d89b99cb3a7937c2b71eaebe/public/logo-reach.png", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article6408422.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Calvin-Harris-and-Taylor-Swift.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article8203433.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/TomHiddlestonTaylorSwiftMain.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article7895637.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Tom Hiddleston and Taylor Swift dance their butts off", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article7684616.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Taylor-Swift-iHeartRadio-awards-2016.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/ipso.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article7883940.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Taylor-Swift-Met-Gala-2016.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article7884581.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Tom-Hiddleston-at-The-Metropolitan-Museum-of-Arts-Costume-Institute-Benefit.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/assets/mirror/logos/masthead-mirror-default.svg"], "top_img": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article8203433.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/TomHiddlestonTaylorSwiftMain.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zoe Shenton", "Rebecca Merriman", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/taylor-swift-tom-hiddleston-obvious-8205027", "title": "Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston had 'obvious chemistry' during flirty Met Ball dance-off BEFORE Calvin Harris split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"page_id": 6149699161, "app_id": 123792601022133, "pages": 1814357575554395}, "description": "The couple were spotted locking lips just two weeks after the singer's relationship with Calvin Harris came to an end", "author": "Rebecca Merriman", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "Googlebot-News": "noarchive", "referrer": "unsafe-URL", "keywords": "Calvin Harris, Taylor Swift, Tom Hiddleston", "news_keywords": "Calvin Harris, Taylor Swift, Tom Hiddleston", "allowTaboolaDeepDive": "true", "vf": {"00000000-0000-4000-8000-67e599051dc3": "mirror-prod-8205027"}, "og": {"title": "Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddleston's flirty Met Ball dance -
