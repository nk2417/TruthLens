The former Laguna Beach star may have gotten his start on reality TV, but would the single star ever return to his roots to find love?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a single man. Yes, so The Bachelor season 47,\u201d Colletti, 32, said to Us during our \u201cIn Case You Missed Us\u201d podcast.\n\nRelated: Stars Who Got Their Start on Reality TV The road to success in Hollywood is a little different for every would-be actor, but these days, reality TV is becoming a major launching pad for some of the industry's biggest stars. Before they were red-carpet regulars, NeNe Leakes, Jennifer Hudson, Julianne Hough and Lucy Hale were among those who broke through as reality stars\n\nHowever, after a little more thought it appears that Colletti will not be going on any group dates anytime soon. The Everyone is Doing Great star told Us, \u201cNo I wouldn\u2019t [go on The Bachelor.] I think we\u2019ve handled enough realty TV on this end.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say he wouldn\u2019t consider making an appearance on the hit ABC show, but his former One Tree Hill costar James Lafferty would have to tag along.\n\n\u201cWe hand out the roses,\u201d Colletti told Us. \u201cJust the rose holder. You [Lafferty] come in not saying anything. That looks like Nathan Scott, James Lafferty. He\u2019s on The Bachelor?! \u201c\n\nRelated: Celebrities Who Love The Bachelor! Stars really are just like Us \u2014 they, too, can\u2019t get enough of the Bachelor franchise! Over the years, many celebrities have shared their obsession with the show. In 2016, Blue Bloods actor Donnie Wahlberg shared his passion for the show, penning more than 1,000 words for Chicago Splash about his obsession. \u201cHow I lost [\u2026]\n\nAll kidding aside Lafferty, 33 reveals he is \u201crespectfully spoken for\u201d in the dating department, while Colletti, who once dated Kristin Cavallari, is still looking.\n\n\u201cThere is not a type of girl I\u2019m looking for,\u201d Colletti told Us. I\u2019m open. Open for applications.\u201d\n\nBut for right now Colletti and Lafferty are focusing on getting their pilot Everyone is Doing Great to air. They recently enlisted the help of their former One Tree Hill costars Sophia Bush and Antwon Tanner, once again sparking rumors of a reunion.\n\n\u201cWe do get this question a lot,\u201d Lafferty told Us. \u201cAnd it\u2019s super flattering because there\u2019s nothing more validating than people saying they want to see more of something that you made, which is great. But first of all, not that much time has passed since the show ended. You kind of feel like a little bit more time should pass before a reunion happens. It\u2019s like in high school, you don\u2019t really have a reunion until 10 years out. Right?\u201d\n\nRelated: Costars Reunited! Nothing like a little reunion! Stars from both TV and film are constantly reuniting in Hollywood, whether it be on a red carpet or for a new project. Check out stars -- from shows and movies like That '70s Show, Saved by the Bell and Full House -- that have come together years after they took their last bows together\n\nHe added: \u201cBut aside from that, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to find anyone on the cast that would say no to it.\u201d\n\nFans can donate to Lafferty and Colletti\u2019s Everyone Is Doing Great Indiegogo campaign
