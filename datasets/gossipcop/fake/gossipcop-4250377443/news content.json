Yes, exactly what you just read. Online trolls can\u2019t bully him to death, he says. And he wonders why they\u2019re getting away with such abusive behavior.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been getting online bullied and in public by people for 9 months. I\u2019ve spoken about BPD and being suicidal publicly only in the hopes that it will help bring awareness and help kids like myself who don\u2019t want to be on this earth,\u201d the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d actor said bluntly Monday on Instagram.\n\n\u201cI just want you guys to know. No matter how hard the internet or anyone tries to make me kill myself. I won\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d actor, who has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, was presumably referring to his break from pop star Ariana Grande. The two met in March and became an item toward the end of May, got engaged just weeks into the relationship and then split up in October.\n\nShe has got around 137 million Instagram followers, some of whom have apparently been talking to \u2014 or at \u2014 Davidson online. He has no verified Twitter or Facebook accounts.\n\nHe said he has kept his mouth shut about the online bullying to this point and hasn\u2019t mentioned any names \u2014 nor does he drop any names in the post.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to understand how when something happens to a guy the whole entire world just trashes him without any facts or frame of reference,\u201d Davidson wrote. \u201cEspecially in today\u2019s climate where everyone loves to be offended and upset it truly is mind boggling.\u201d\n\nPete Davidson just posted a touching note about mental health to his Instagram pic.twitter.com/nAudS7NdmU \u2014 Alexis Benveniste (@apbenven) December 3, 2018\n\nDavidson\u2019s missive comes on the heels of the new video for Grande\u2019s hit song \u201cthank u, next,\u201d whose title echoes a Twitter comment involving the actor.\n\nThe singer put Davidson\u2019s statement and a comment of her own on her Instagram story around midnight, urging her many fans to change their behavior.\n\n\u201c[I] really don\u2019t endorse anything but forgiveness and positivity. i care deeply about pete and his health. i\u2019m asking you to please be gentler with others, even on the internet,\u201d Grande said, in part.\n\nLater in the statement, she got a bit more specific.\n\n\u201c[P]lease let whatever point you\u2019re trying to make go. I will always have irrevocable love for him and if you\u2019ve gotten any other impression from my recent work, you might have missed the point,\u201d she said.\n\nHere\u2019s Grande\u2019s statement in full:\n\n\u201ci know u already know this but i feel i need to remind my fans to please be gentler with others. i really don\u2019t endorse anything but forgiveness and positivity. i care deeply about pete and his health. i\u2019m asking you to please be gentler with others, even on the internet. i\u2019ve learned thru my own mistakes not to be reactive on socials so i do understand. but you truly don\u2019t know what anybody is experiencing ever. regardless of what they choose to display on social media or how they may appear in public. i can promise u that. so please let whatever point you\u2019re trying to make go. I will always have irrevocable love for him and if you\u2019ve gotten any other impression from my recent work, you might have missed the point.\u201d\n\nBorderline personality disorder is \u201cmarked by an ongoing pattern of varying moods, self-image and behavior,\u201d according to the National Institute of Mental Health website. Symptoms can often result in impulsive actions and relationship problems, with people experiencing intense episodes of anger, depression and anxiety that last for hours or days.\n\nPeople with BPD tend to experience things as all good or all bad, and according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the risk of self-harming behavior or suicide is an extreme risk.\n\nUPDATE\n\nDec. 4, 10:18 a.m.: This post was updated with the statement from Grande.\n\nThis post was originally published on Dec. 3 at 12:37 p.m.", "images":
