So what comes with that price tag?\n\nThe house includes eight bedrooms, eight bathrooms, a swimming pool, a hot tub, a home cinema, koi ponds, waterfalls, oh, and it's very own private beach. Are you able?\n\n'It\u2019s everything Harry and Meghan could want \u2013 and it\u2019s perfect for when they have kids,' a source told the publication.\n\nOh and not only are they splashing the cash by buying it, they also intend on spend an extra $1 million to decorate it to their own taste!\n\nThe couple want to spend time in Malibu because it means that Meghan can see her family and friends a lot. According to the source they want Meghan's mum to move into the guest house so she can have the run of the place when they're in the UK.\n\nTake a look at the house in the gallery below", "images":
