Tess [also] realised she still had feelings for her ex after splitting from him to date Harry and has apologised to him for her romance with the singer.\n\n\"It will take a while for Tess to build back his trust but they have been getting on as normal. She was in London this week and met her ex straight away \u2014 they\u2019ve been inseparable since.\"\n\nThe poor little lamb. Still, there's probably a jazzy shirt or a metallic pair of boots around that'll cheer him up, right?\n\nThe pair were first linked last month, when an insider revealed to The Sun that Harry and Tess were introduced my mutual friends, and he quickly became \"besotted\" with her.\n\n\"As soon as Harry met Tess there was an instant spark between them\", they explained. \"They really bonded over their mutual love of quirky fashion and food \u2013 and things turned romantic quickly.\n\n\n\n\"They've been on a number of dates while Harry has been in London and he's already introduced Tess to some of his close friends including his personal stylist Lou Teasdale.\n\n\"This really seems different to Harry's past relationships as Harry genuinely is besotted with Tess and doesn't want to risk messing this one up.\"\n\nPoor Harry. If he wants to watch Bridget Jones and eat Ben & Jerry's, he knows where we are.", "images":
