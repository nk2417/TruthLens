First, we heard she planned to give birth at home, then they said her security has been running weekly drills to practice their approach to Cedars-Sinai and now there\u2019s a report that Bey wants silence in the delivery room.\n\nAccording to Naughty Gossip reports:\n\n\u201cBeyonc\u00e9 likes peace and calm around her. She has zero time for drama and gossip. She likes her inner circle to be soft spoken if they have to talk at all. And you can expect the same will be true when she gives birth to the twins,\u201d sources tell Straight Shuter. \u201cYou can only get into her private life if you are invited. She is very guarded and protects her privacy at all cost. She likes to be surrounded with peaceful colors and soft sounds. This will be of utmost importance for her when giving birth.\u201d\n\nThis story is almost like opening up a fortune cookie or visiting your average storefront psychic. EVERYBODY knows Beyonc\u00e9 is private. THAT doesn\u2019t take an exclusive source to figure out.\n\nSilent birth is a real thing though \u2013 something that Scientologists practice and Katie Holmes even did when she gave birth to Suri, but as much as Bey loves music we don\u2019t really see her doing a silent birth.\n\nSpeaking of Bey\u2019s love of music\u2026 Hit the flip for some recently posted pics of her from a Michael Jackson/Prince party.\n\nGettyImages/Instagram", "images": ["https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/11/17624611092691-e1762461562615.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&crop=0,0,100,139px", "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/11/image-collage-5.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1680&crop=0,0,100,960px", "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/10/image-collage-13.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1680&crop=0,0,100,960px", "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/10/17618568738685.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=266&crop=0,0,100,220px", "https://hellobeautiful.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/50/2025/11/17635366739118-e1763536765514.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=840&crop=0,0,100,480px", "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/11/image-collage-20.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1680&crop=0,0,100,960px", "https://globalgrind.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/11/176313861866.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=840&crop=0,0,100,480px", "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/11/17634859309422.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=1024&crop=0,0,100,683px", "https://madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/11/17634507213011.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=724&crop=0,0,100,480px", "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/11/17621319898225.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&crop=0px%2C26px%2C777px%2C445px&resize=1680%2C960", "https://hiphopwired.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2025/11/17635022476475.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=840&crop=0,0,100,480px", "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2017/05/beyonce-jay-z-blue-ivy-2.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=800&crop=0,0,100,598px", "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/11/17631562630529.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&crop=0,0,100,173px", "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/11/17620566717845.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&crop=0px%2C49px%2C682px%2C390px&resize=1680%2C960", "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2025/11/17622133605207.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&crop=0,0,100,191px", "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2017/05/beyonce-blue-ivy-jay-z.jpg?strip=all&quality=80"], "top_img": "https://bossip.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/28/2017/05/beyonce-jay-z-blue-ivy-2.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=800&crop=0,0,100,598px", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jane\u00e9 Bolden"], "canonical_link": "https://bossip.com/1560921/is-beysus-demanding-silence-in-the-delivery-room-for-births-of-blueprint-1-and-blueprint-2/", "title": "Here's The Latest Crazy Story About Beyonce's Delivery Room Demands", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "aXMHIPRvllF-EjF0NAn-U9PvSOviqRfhNv5Sr3ut-2I", "msvalidate.01": "30473C9E51B1FA7645F80C5736971CF1", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 reportedly may give birth to her twins in silence.
