They arrived in a flash black Lamborghini with Bryan behind the wheel.\n\ntouch my body Mariah Carey\u2019s boyfriend Bryan Tanaka can\u2019t keep his hands off her as he feels up her thighs on date night\n\nMARIAH Carey\u2019s loved-up boyfriend Bryan Tanaka couldn\u2019t resist placing his hands on the singer\u2019s thighs as they made their way into Nobu restaurant in Malibu.\n\nThe smitten pair arrived in a stunning black Lamborghini with Bryan, 34, behind the wheel and climbed out of the eye-catching scissor doors.\n\nMariah, 47, wore a busty black minidress with side cut outs, which she teamed with see-through tights and knee-high heeled boots.\n\nShe carried her leather jacked over her shoulder and held Bryan\u2019s hand while smiling at the cameras.\n\nHis muscular arms burst from his tight short-sleeved shirt which he wore with dark jeans and loafers.\n\nThe couple briefly stopped and showed each other affection, with Bryan cosying into his girl while placing his hands on her thighs and pulling down gently on her dress.\n\nMeanwhile Mariah put her hands on his shoulders and gazed bashfully over into the distance.\n\nJust days ago Westlife\u2019s Mark Feehily revealed Mariah once ate Chinese food sitting on the floor of his friend\u2019s flat in Hoxton \u2013 and isn\u2019t the diva she\u2019s claimed to be.\n\nThe Irish singer, 37, who is making a comeback after he was asked to be Mimi\u2019s Special Guest on her epic Christmas tour in December, gave an incredible insight to what hanging out with the star off-stage is really like.\n\nSpeaking exclusively to The Sun Online, Mark, said: \u201cThey say never meet your idols \u2013 but this couldn\u2019t be more opposite for Mariah.\n\n\u201cThe last time I went to see Mariah she was playing in Wembley.\n\n\u201cAfterwards we went to a friend\u2019s apartment in Hackney.\n\n\u201cWe literally ordered a Chinese and sat on the floor eating our takeaway.\n\n\u201cSo we were sitting on the floor, eating our Chinese and drinking champagne in a flat in London, discussing what was going on on the telly and having a laugh.\n\n\u201cHer super stretch white limo was parked outside the block of flats. Next to all the other cars!\n\n\u201cTo me that\u2019s a good example of who she is, the biggest selling female superstar of all time, a massive diva, she loves all the fabulous life of course but at same time she\u2019s very down to earth and not afraid to hang out in her mate\u2019s flat and have a Chinese and a bit of a laugh.\u201d\n\nThe pair met in 1999 when she recorded duet Against All Odds with Westlife, and have remained friends ever since.\n\nMark, who has kept a low profile since Westlife split five years ago, has been quietly working on new material for next year, when he got the call to be part of Mariah\u2019s epic show.\n\nHe said: \u2018\u2019I\u2019m beaming. Doing a Christmas record is an idea I\u2019ve had for a long time.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cThen when I got the call and the opportunity to be the special guest on the Mariah show it felt like the perfect opportunity to put this idea into action \u2013 at the biggest Christmas event in the pop world this year.\u201d\n\nMark has turned his life around after reaching his lowest point when Westlife split, at the same time he was nursing heartbreak from separating from his fianc\u00e9.\n\nHe recalled: \u201cSo Westlife ended and my seven year relationship ended all at once. That was a tough and dark time. There was no aftercare. It\u2019s like \u2018thanks for selling 55million albums, now bye!\u2019 It\u2019s tough.\u201d\n\nMark told how he took time away from the spotlight to rebuild his confidence and got therapy.\n\nAfter quietly plugging away with new material, he got the call he had dreamed of from their mutual gig agent saying Mariah wanted him on the tour.\n\nHe added: \u201cThis Mariah gig is the icing on the cake.\u201d\n\nUK dates for the Mariah Carey: All I Want For Christmas Is You tour include Sunday 10 December at the Manchester Arena and Monday 11 December at the O2, London.\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220.\n\nWe pay for videos too.
