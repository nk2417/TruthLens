The cover star opened up about her first marriage to Tom Cruise and what it\u2019s like celebrating a decade of marital bliss with her second husband, country singer Keith Urban.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re older, you\u2019ve been through things, you\u2019ve made mistakes,\u201d Kidman said, adding that the first three months of marriage to the singer were tough. \u201cSo you come into it [a second marriage], still giddy, but wanting it to last. We always consider the \u2018us.\u2019 We say, \u2018Is this going to be good for us?\u2019 It\u2019s the simplest phrase, but it works.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Oscar-winning actress also opened up about her nearly 11-year marriage to \u201cEyes Wide Shut\u201d co-star Tom Cruise, saying that she was \u201cso young\u201d when the two wed.\n\n\u201cI look back now and I\u2019m like, \u2018What?\u2019 You look at Taylor Swift, I mean how old is she? She\u2019s 26,\u201d Kidman said. \u201cI had two kids by the time I was 27 and I\u2019d been married for four years. But that\u2019s what I wanted.\u201d\n\nSo gorgeous.
