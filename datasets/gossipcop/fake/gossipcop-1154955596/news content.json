She has it all worked out, but falling pregnant again quickly is crucial,\u2019 the insider explains.\n\nThat her body has bounced back so well after having Prince Louis just three months ago \u2013 Kate revealed this was down to running around after her children so much \u2013 is a sure sign she\u2019s ready to produce another heir.\n\nThe double baby news comes amid last week\u2019s revelation by Vanity Fair that Kate and Meghan\u2019s friendship has greatly strengthened in the past few months, with Meghan now seeing Kate as a \u2018pillar of support\u2019.\n\nAs Meghan continues to face almost daily embarrassment from her estranged father Thomas Markle \u2013 who last wee even accused the palace of lying to him \u2013 her relationship with Kate has become a huge comfort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey talk on the phone and try to make sure they see each other at least once a week.\n\nRelated: Kate Middleton and Prince William expecting fourth child\n\nRelated: Meghan and Harry\u2019s twin joy\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\n\u2018Kate\u2019s well aware of what Meghan is going through,\u2019 a source told the magazine.\n\n\u2018Her family has been dragged through the tabloids and she knows it\u2019s not nice.

This means they\u2019re more likely to release two eggs or more per cycle than younger women. Therefore, it is believed that\u2019s why there\u2019s a higher incidence of multiple birth babies in older women.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated: Confirmed: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle \u2013 \u2018Yes, it\u2019s twins!\u2019\n\nAs for Harry, during a walkabout in Ireland last month, he hinted he might not want a super-sized family while chatting with a fan. \u2018My husband also has red hair and he gave me five children,\u2019 Elaine Adam-Stewart said. \u2018When are you and Meghan going to get going?\u2019 Harry joked back: \u2018Five children?
