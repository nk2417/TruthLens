The Fuller House star took to Instagram on Tuesday to upload a new pic with her professional dancer pal.\n\n\u201cWent to #dwts last night to go cheer on my family, my brother, one of my best friends @keo-motsepe,\u201d Sweetin wrote in the caption.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of how hard he works and even though his journey this season was short, I know he\u2019ll be ready to come back for more (and hopefully longer!) again next season. Love you, Keo!! #friendsarefamily #pineapple #teammosweet.\u201d\n\nSweetin made the appearance on the DWTS set amid the reports that she has reportedly relapsed. The Blast reported earlier this week her ex-husband, Morty Coyle, had \u201cserious concerns\u201d about the 35-year-old actress\u2019 sobriety.\n\nThe two were married from 2012-2015. While on the phone with Sweetin, he says he became worried due to the way she sounded.\n\nCoyle says that Sweetin was not stable after her recent break-up with ex-fiance Justin Hodak. He started to \u201csuspect she is resorting to substance use as the means to cope with these traumatic events.\u201d\n\nOne of Sweetin\u2019s representatives told multiple outlets that the relapse claims are \u201ccompletely baseless\u201d and \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not the first time Mr. Coyle has made ridiculous accusations about Jodie which were utterly untrue,\u201d Sweetin\u2019s rep said.", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/boston-blue-faith-and-family-sonequa-martin-green-donnie-wahlberg-cbs.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "http://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/04/70839b1d-3826-4242-9848-ca2fff9b687f.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/04/45511bc5-8791-4d0b-a2e9-34e9c9011b24.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/70afec6a-3143-4947-b047-428e525611d4.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hunter Miller", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/jodie-sweetin-dancing-with-the-stars-relapse/", "title": "Jodie Sweetin Attended \u2018DWTS\u2019 Amid Relapse Reports", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jodie Sweetin Attended 'DWTS' Amid Relapse Reports", "description": "Despite the reports that she has relapsed, Jodie Sweetin made an appearance backstage at Dancing With the Stars to support her friend Keo Motsepe.
