She\u2019d be horrified if she knew the extent of the relationship because she\u2019d think of it as a complete betrayal on both their parts.\u2019\n\nJust for some posterity, shall we remind you all Selena once said this about Jennifer Aniston:\n\n\u2018I always say that I worship Rachel McAdams as a movie actress but for comedy\u2014the whole reason I started my show and mannerisms, they were after Jennifer Aniston,\u2019 she told Just Jared in 2009.\n\n\u2018It was so funny, they were playing clip reels of the work she\u2019s done and I quoted the whole thing. Every single thing she\u2019d say, I would say it. People were sitting there laughing at me and they\u2019re like, \u201cWow, you\u2019re obsessed.'\u201d\n\nRead into that what you will.\n\nAy ay ay, this is all more drama than that time Ross and Rachel were on a break.\n\nMetro.co.uk contacted reps for comment.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
