Wtf. \u2014 Tina Moore (@TMoore8114) May 8, 2018\n\nBright side Sarah Jessica Parker looked 60 years old \u2014 Patty Rushing (@patty_guynn) May 8, 2018\n\nOn Instagram, people were just as mean: \u201cBIG put her through too much #StressandTheCity,\u201d \u201cGirl has aged,\u201d \u201cShe is overdue for fillers,\u201d and \u201cSarah, darling, the word for today is MOISTURIZER.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAnd when Stefano Gabbana Instagrammed some red carpet looks, commenters remarked that Parker \u201clooks older\u201d and \u201cscary.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that women of a certain age aren\u2019t exactly a draw in Hollywood. One study conducted by the University of Southern California\u2019s Media, Diversity, & Social Change Initiative found that of 1,256 film characters in the 25 Best Picture-nominated films from 2014 to 2016, only 11.8 were 60 years old or older. And in half of the films that did feature a significant or supporting older character, the film contained lines that emphasized or joked about age.\n\nAnother study from the same group found that \u201c[o]f the 100 top films of 2015, 32% depicted a female as the lead or co-lead of the unfolding narrative. This is an 11% increase from last year. Five of these films portrayed female leads/co-leads 45 years of age or older at the time of theatrical release in 2015. In stark contrast, 26 movies in 2015 featured leads or co-leads with males 45 years of age or older.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe intersection of ageism and sexism devalues women \u2014 whereas age distinguishes men,\u201d Ashton Applewhite, author of This Chair Rocks, tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cIt\u2019s an outlook developed early in life from reading children\u2019s books, watching cartoon characters like Homer Simpson, or being exposed to stereotypes, like all grandmothers sit in rocking chairs knitting.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nEven in our 20s, she says, women are told to use Botox or get fillers in their hands ahead of \u201cengagement selfies,\u201d guided by the notion that \u201caging can somehow be stopped.\u201d Applewhite adds, \u201cIn the workplace, we see ageism around age 32, when women are often passed over for promotions based on the assumption that they may get married and have children.\u201d\n\nAccording to Andrew Hanssen, professor of economics at Clemson University, ageism is equally problematic in Hollywood. In 2016, he co-authored a study that outlined the dwindling opportunities for women as they age: 20-something women nabbed 80 percent of leading roles, for 30-year-olds that number was 40 percent, and beyond age 40, only 20 percent.\n\n\u201cAging is a bad career move, whether you\u2019re a man or woman; however, it\u2019s seen as more negative for women,\u201d he tells Yahoo Lifestyle, explaining that in popular romantic movies where sexual attraction plays a role, female youth is prized above other attributes. That may explain why female celebrities start and end their careers earlier than men, who aren\u2019t typically taken seriously for major roles until they hit their 30s.\n\nIn 2016, Madonna, now 59, faced her own criticism for wearing a revealing Givenchy outfit to the Met Gala.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u201cWe have fought and continue to fight for civil rights and gay rights around the world,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cWhen it comes to women\u2019s rights we are still in the dark ages. My dress at the Met Ball was a political statement as well as a fashion statement. The fact that people actually believe a woman is not allowed to express her sexuality and be adventurous past a certain age is proof that we still live in an ageist and sexist society. I have never thought in a limited way and I\u2019m not going to start.\u201d\n\nMadonna was criticized for her appearance at the 2016 Met Gala.
