outfit - here's the truth\n\nKate arrived at the service hand-in-hand with the bridesmaids, including daughter Princess Charlotte, who were dressed in white with rose-adorned headbands\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge looked gorgeous in a 'cream' tailored coat by fashion favourite Alexander McQueen for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding at St George's Chapel, in Windsor.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nOf course, it's the same designer who created Kate's wedding dress for her big day in April 2011.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nKate arrived at the service hand-in-hand with the bridesmaids, including daughter Princess Charlotte, 3, who were dressed in white with rose-adorned headbands.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nShe teamed her ensemble with a matching Philip Treacy hat and shoes by Jimmy Choo.\n\nThough undeniably stunning, the Duchess' choice created a stir as wedding protocol dictates that only the bride wears white when tying the knot.\n\nView 6 Images Kate sits alongside Camilla, Prince Andrew and Princess

evening party READ MORE :\n\nMany viewers took to Twitter to complain about the colour.\n\n\"I'm no wedding expert... but should Kate Middleton be wearing white to a wedding if it's not her wedding?\"\n\n\"Is Kate Middleton srsly (sic) wearing white to the #RoyalWedding \"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\" Kate Middleton : the only person in the world who can get away with wearing white at a wedding.\"\n\n\"Kate Middleton in white ... she just can\u2019t take that it\u2019s someone else\u2019s day.\"\n\n\"Doesn\u2019t Kate Middleton know you shouldn\u2019t wear white/ivory to a wedding????\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nHowever, the truth is the outfit is actually a \"primrose yellow wool silk tailored coat\", NOT a white or cream dress.\n\nIt's the fourth time Kate has worn this outfit, including to Charlotte's christening in July 2015\n\nView 6 Images The bridal party arrives (Image: PA)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s one of the first times we\u2019ve seen the Duchess of Cambridge in public since she gave birth to her third child Prince Louis on April 23.\n\nKate wore a red bespoke Jenny Packham dress with a white lace collar to introduce her baby boy to the world, as she and William left the Lindo Wing at St Mary\u2019s Hospital.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nShe was also spotted on her way to Windsor two days before the wedding for the rehearsal, wearing sunglasses and a floral Michael Kors dress.\n\nStunning fireworks display ,lights up Windsor, after royal wedding\n\n6 View 6 Images (Image: Daily Mirror) 6 View 6 Images The Duchess of Cambridge with Prince George
