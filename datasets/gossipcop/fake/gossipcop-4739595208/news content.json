Some want to take advantage of that, so let's have each other's backs.\"\n\nFans responded with their own tales of being approached by fake Robert Downey Jrs and people impersonating other celebrities - and how they got their own back.\n\nBrittany Jeter: \"They keep coming at me, well until I quizzed the one and he wasn't you Robert Downey Jr. He failed that quiz on the first question and then got mad at me.\"\n\nUlrike Scherling: \"Countless false RDJs I reported. Amazingly enough they turned into false Ben Stillers then and finally into a bunch of fake Elton Johns.\"\n\nPhyllis Hall: \"I've had several 'famous persons' that I follow contact me via messenger. I make 'em back off real quick with one simple request: Show me your face. And their responses are incredibly LAME. They can't seem to do that, for whatever reason, so they get blocked...and reported.\"\n\nMartha Holbrook: \"I had an impostor Mark Rufflo try to scam me. I asked him a few questions about his career and politics. He didn't even know basic movie questions about movies he was in. I blocked him.\"\n\nKatherine Morrissey: \"I once trolled a Robert Downey Jr imposter making him believe I believed it was him and then when I got bored, I informed Facebook about the imposter's account and they quickly removed it. Was a little fun.\"\n\nTracy Madson: \"This happened to me not long ago with someone claiming to be Hugh Jackman. It was hilarious that this person didn't know 1/2 of the movies Hugh has made when I quizzed him. Idiot ppl out there, that's for sure.\"\n\nCole Rife: \"Happened with me and ryan gosling ...I knew this kid was scamming me so I ran with it and finally said I was Donald Duck and you quack me up hahaha, he didn't like that at all lol\"\n\nEarlier this year, country singer Brad Paisley warned fans about a similar scam.\n\nAllow X content?
