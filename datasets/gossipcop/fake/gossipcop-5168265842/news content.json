Her mother, Tina Knowles (n\u00e9e Beyonc\u00e9), was a hairdresser and salon owner,[7] while her father, Mathew Knowles, was a sales manager at Xerox. Mathew is African-American,[10] while Tina is Louisiana Creole with African, French, Irish, Breton, Norman, and Native American ancestry.[11][12][13] Beyonc\u00e9's younger sister, Solange, is also a singer and actress.[14][15] They are descendants of Acadian militia officer Joseph Broussard, who was exiled to French Louisiana after the expulsion of the Acadians.[16] Both sisters also have Belgian ancestry from Hainaut Province, Wallonia.[17][18] Beyonc\u00e9 was raised within multiple religious traditions, attending both St. John's United Methodist Church and St. Mary of the Purification Catholic Church in Houston.[19][20] Her first job as a child was sweeping hair and occasionally performing for customers at her mother's hair salon.[21]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 began her education at St. Mary's Catholic Montessori School, where she also took dance classes.[22] Her vocals were discovered by her dance instructor, who began humming a song that Beyonc\u00e9 completed.[23] Beyonc\u00e9's interest in music and performing grew after she won a school talent show at the age of seven by singing John Lennon's \"Imagine\", winning against older competitors aged fifteen and sixteen. In 1990, nine-year-old Beyonc\u00e9 enrolled in Parker Elementary School, a music magnet school in Houston, where she performed with the school's choir.[26] She later attended the Kinder High School for the Performing and Visual Arts and subsequently Alief Elsik High School.[28] Beyonc\u00e9 was also a member of the choir at St. John's United Methodist Church, where she sang her first solo and was a soloist for two years.[19][29]\n\n1990\u20132001: Early career and Destiny's Child\n\nIn 1990, Beyonc\u00e9 met singer LaTavia Roberson while in an audition for an all-girl entertainment group.[30] Joined by Kelly Rowland two years later,[30] the trio was placed in Girl's Tyme, a group that performed rap and dance routines on Houston's talent show circuit.[31][32] In 1993, the group was entered in Star Search, the largest national talent show on television at the time. Competing in the show's singing category, the group lost the competition, which Beyonc\u00e9 attributed to a poor song choice.[33] After LeToya Luckett joined in 1993, Girl's Tyme continued performing as an opening act for established R&B girl groups.[30] In 1995, Mathew left his job to manage the group, which halved the Knowles family's income, leading to them moving into separate apartments.[30][35][36] The group was briefly signed by Elektra Records and later dropped; ensuing tensions led to a six-month separation of Beyonc\u00e9's parents.[37][38] The Knowles family later reunited and the group secured a contract with Columbia Records, aided by talent scout Teresa LaBarbera Whites.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 in 2001\n\nThe group adopted the name Destiny's Child in 1997, based upon a passage in the Book of Isaiah.[40] That year, they released their major-label debut song, \"Killing Time\", which appeared on the soundtrack for the film Men in Black.[42] Their debut single and first major hit, \"No, No, No\", preceded their debut album, Destiny's Child (1998), a moderate success.[42] Released in July 1999, the group's second album, The Writing's on the Wall, peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200 and later achieved multi-platinum status in the country.[45][46] The record spawned the singles \"Bills, Bills, Bills\", \"Say My Name\", and \"Jumpin', Jumpin'\"; the former two both peaked atop the US Billboard Hot 100.[47][45][48] \"Say My Name\" won Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and Best R&B Song at the 2001 Grammy Awards.

She wrote, directed, and produced the film in partnership with AMC Theatres.[284] Having won four of her nine nominations at the 65th Annual Grammy Awards, Beyonc\u00e9 became the most-awarded person in Grammy history, with a total of 32 accolades.[285][286]\n\nOn February 11, 2024, Beyonc\u00e9 announced the second installment of her trilogy project and released its first two singles, \"Texas Hold 'Em\" and \"16 Carriages\".[287][288] \"Texas Hold 'Em\" became her ninth solo number-one on the Billboard Hot 100 and her first on the Billboard Global 200.[289][290] On March 12, 2024, she announced the album's title, Cowboy Carter, releasing it to universal acclaim on March 29.[291][292][293] An Americana-inspired record,[294] Cowboy Carter highlights the historically overlooked contributions of Black pioneers to country music.[295] It debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, making Beyonc\u00e9 the only female artist to debut her first eight studio albums at number one in the US, with 407,000 copies sold in its first week.[296][274] The album's third single, \"II Most Wanted\", featuring Miley Cyrus, debuted at number six in the US.[297] In July 2024, NBC released two promotional commercials featuring Beyonc\u00e9 for their coverage of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.[298]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 returned as Nala in Mufasa: The Lion King (2024), a prequel to the 2019 remake.[299] In December 2024, she headlined the first-ever NFL Christmas Gameday Halftime Show, debuting songs from Cowboy Carter.[300] At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards in 2025, she became the first Black artist in 50 years to win in the country categories,[301] and the first Black artist to win Best Country Album.[302] She also won Album of the Year, the first Black woman to do so in 25 years.[303] That year, Beyonc\u00e9 embarked on the Cowboy Carter Tour across the US and Europe, which went on to become the highest-grossing country tour of all time.[304][305]\n\nArtistry\n\nMusical style\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's music is primarily R&B, pop,[308] and hip-hop,[310] and also incorporates elements of soul and funk.[144][311] With continuous musical reinventions,[312] Beyonc\u00e9 has been described as a musical \"chameleon\" by publications such as Vox and Billboard.[314][315] Expanding beyond the hip-hop and R&B sound she featured in her previous two albums\u2014Dangerously in Love and B'Day\u2014I Am... Sasha Fierce incorporates a 1980s electropop- and Europop-imbued sound, featuring instruments such as synthesizers and the acoustic guitar.[316][317] With the album 4, she expanded her use of soul and hip-hop compared to earlier work.[318][319] Drawing from 1970s funk, 1980s pop, and 1990s soul influences, 4 featured elements of hard rock, reggae, and adult contemporary.[320][321] Minimalism inspired Beyonc\u00e9's self-titled album,[322][323] which employed emotive falsetto and often braggadocio, using fragmented song structures that rejected traditional pop formats in favor of atmosphere.[324][325] Lemonade incorporated a broader range of genres, including rock, country, gospel, reggae, and blues.[327][328]\n\nThe Lion King: The Gift was conceived as a record rooted in cultural celebration. As such, Beyonc\u00e9 recruited artists and producers from across the African continent and explored genres such as Afropop and gqom. Delving into disco, ballroom culture, and 1990s club sounds,[331] Renaissance extensively made use of four-on-the-floor beats and pulsating synths, with interpolations of queer and Black dance music pioneers.[311][332] Beyonc\u00e9 conceived Cowboy Carter as a multi-genre reclamation of Americana music.[334][335] The country and gospel-tinged epic features instrumentation such as the accordion, harmonica, acoustic guitar, and banjo.[336][337][338] Although she mainly records in English, Beyonc\u00e9 released Spanish-language tracks for Irreemplazable (2007)\u2014a Spanish reissue of songs from B'Day.[339][340]\n\nVoice\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range. T's Jody Rosen praised her musical tone and timbre as especially distinctive, calling her voice \"one of the most compelling instruments in popular music\".[349] While Rosen credited the hip-hop era for shaping her rhythmic vocal style, he also noted her traditionalist leanings through balladry, gospel, and falsetto.[349] Her voice was described as \"velvety yet tart, with an insistent flutter and reserves of soul belting\" by Jon Pareles.[350]\n\nOn Dangerously in Love, Beyonc\u00e9's vocals balance between sultry utters and powerful belting,[351][352] while B'Day incorporated melismatic vocals and staccato phrasing.[353][354] Throughout I Am... Sasha Fierce, Beyonc\u00e9 employs vibrato yelps and trills,[317] often singing in a lower register on several tracks.[355][356] With 4, she opted for \"brass[y] and gritt[y]\" vocals.[357] \"Love on Top\" has multiple key changes with sustained vocal power,[358] while growls and raspy textures characterize such songs as \"Start Over\".[359] She embraced more breathy and airy vocals on Beyonc\u00e9, with squeaky falsettos and wordless ecstasies accompanied by spoken word and rap-singing\u2014what Kitty Empire dubbed \"hood rat rapping\".[360] Beyonc\u00e9 adopted a looser, more genre-fluid approach on Lemonade, drawing on Southern roots with the twang of \"Daddy Lessons\";[361] a hushed and intimate tone on \"Pray You Catch Me\";[362] and raspy, distorted, and shouted vocals to channel raw anger on \"Don't Hurt Yourself\".[363]\n\nOn Renaissance, Beyonc\u00e9's vocals are processed with electronic effects such as reverb, distortion, and modulation.[364] She predominantly sings in her natural Texan accent on Cowboy Carter, with Southern American English elements.[365] However, on the Caro mio ben excerpt in \"Daughter\", she adopts a classical operatic vocal style.[366] Chris Richards, in an article for The Washington Post, highlighted her vocal range and power, noting she could \"punctuate any beat with goose-bump-inducing whispers or full-bore diva-roars\".[367] In Rolling Stone's 2023 list of the \"200 Greatest Singers of All Time\", Beyonc\u00e9 ranked eighth, with the magazine stating, \"in [her] voice lies the entire history of Black music\".[368]\n\nSongwriting and themes\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has a collaborative and experimental songwriting process, often merging different song parts to create new structures.[371] Early in her career with Destiny's Child, her lyrics often focused on themes of female empowerment, as seen in songs like \"Independent Women\" and \"Survivor\". When her relationship with Jay-Z began, her songwriting style shifted to include more romantic and relationship-focused content with songs such as \"Cater 2 U\".[372] Dangerously in Love explored sexual and romantic themes, with the follow-up B'Day delving into Black women's personal and spiritual discontent, fulfillment, self-worth, and agency. I Am... Sasha Fierce examined themes of love, heartbreak, and the tension between Beyonc\u00e9's self and her stage alter ego;[356] more personal themes characterized 4 and Beyonce, which delved into marriage, monogamy, and intimacy.[319][374]\n\nAround the mid-2010s, Beyonc\u00e9 began exploring historical and political themes.[376] Storytelling and poetry inspired Lemonade, an album that discusses Black womanhood, reconciliation, and heartbreak\u2014particularly in light of Jay-Z's alleged infidelity.[377][379] Scholar Emily J. Lordi described the album as a \"cinematic and sonic Afrodiasporic journey from betrayal to redemption\". Renaissance and Cowboy Carter were conceived to highlight the historically overlooked and marginalized contributions of Black pioneers to American musical and cultural history. The former pays tribute to the influence of Black queer artists in shaping dance music, while the latter centers on the role of Black people in the development of country music.[381][382]\n\nCritics and music artists have analyzed Beyonc\u00e9's distinctive style of songwriting. Caroline Polachek, who worked on \"No Angel\", praised her ability to make connections between ideas, and called her a \"genius\" writer and producer.[383] While writing with Beyonc\u00e9, record producer Sean Garrett described her as \"very particular about her brand\", stating that she rejects anything that feels off-brand.[384] Dubbed a \"meticulous curator\" by The New Yorker,[385] Beyonc\u00e9 has been studied by some academics as a musical archivist, while others have likened her storytelling to that of a modern-day griot.[389] She has received co-writing credits on most of her songs.[390] Beyonc\u00e9 often faces scrutiny over the number of writing credits she receives, with some questioning the extent of her contributions.[391][392]\n\nInfluences\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has named Michael Jackson as her greatest musical influence.[393][394] At the age of five, she attended her first concert where Jackson performed, an experience she later said helped her realize her purpose as a performer.[395] She has also credited Tina Turner as a major inspiration, admiring how she embodied strength while remaining feminine and sexy.[396] Diana Ross influenced her as an \"all-around entertainer\",[397] and Whitney Houston inspired her to pursue performing, saying Houston made her believe she could do the same.[398][399]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 praised Madonna for her music and roles as a businesswoman. She has cited Mariah Carey's vocal style\u2014especially on her song \"Vision of Love\"\u2014as an early influence that inspired her to practice vocal runs as a child.[401][402] Other artists that Beyonc\u00e9 has mentioned as inspirations include Rachelle Ferrell,[403] Aaliyah, Prince,[405] Janet Jackson,[406] Lauryn Hill,[407] Sade Adu,[408] Donna Summer,[409] Fairuz,[410] Mary J. Blige,[411] Selena,[412] Anita Baker,[413] and Toni Braxton.[414][415]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has cited Michelle Obama\u201444th First Lady of the US\u2014as a personal inspiration.[416] She described Oprah Winfrey as \"the definition of inspiration and a strong woman\".[413] Beyonc\u00e9 has stated that her husband, rapper Jay-Z, inspires her, and she has praised his lyrical talent and the challenges he has overcome.[418] She expressed admiration for artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, stating that she wants to emulate his lyrical and raw artistic traits in her music.[419] Beyonc\u00e9 has named Ross and Cher as some of her fashion inspirations.[420]\n\nVideography and stage\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's music videos are known for their visual storytelling, frequent choreography, and thematic cohesion.[422] Albums such as Beyonc\u00e9 (2013) and Lemonade (2016) were released as \"visual albums\", with each track paired with a music video to form a continuous narrative.[183] Beyonc\u00e9 has worked with numerous directors for her music videos, such as Melina Matsoukas,[423] Jonas \u00c5kerlund,[424] and Jake Nava.[425]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 is known for her meticulously produced and physically demanding performances that incorporate elaborate costumes, striking visuals, and stage design.[426] Her shows are characterized by large-scale production elements such as LED staging, supporting ensembles, theatrical props, and numerous costume changes.[427] When performing, Beyonc\u00e9 uses different fashion styles that coordinate with the music she is singing.[428] According to Barbara Ellen, writing for The Guardian, Beyonc\u00e9 is the most in-charge female artist onstage,[429] while Alice Jones of The Independent wrote she \"takes her role as entertainer so seriously she's almost too good\".[430]\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has been praised for her stage presence and voice during live performances,[431] and she is often deemed one of the greatest performers of all time.[432][433] She created the alter ego Sasha Fierce to separate her stage persona from her personal attributes. She characterized her persona as \"too aggressive, too strong, too sassy [and] too sexy\", adding that she is not like her in real life at all.[435] Sasha Fierce was created during the production of \"Crazy in Love\"[436] and was introduced with the release of her third solo studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce, in 2008.[437] By February 2010, Beyonc\u00e9 stated she no longer needed the alter ego, having grown more comfortable with herself.[438] In May 2012, she announced Sasha Fierce would return for her Revel Presents: Beyonc\u00e9 Live performances later that month.[439]\n\nPublic image\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 attending the launch of Usher's fragrance line in 2007\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has been described by critics as having sex appeal.[440][442] Writing for Rolling Stone, music journalist Tour\u00e9 noted that she became a \"crossover sex symbol\" after the release of Dangerously in Love (2003).[443] Scholar Adrienne Trier-Bieniek argued that Beyonc\u00e9's fair skin, ethnically ambiguous features, and hair are central to her status as a sex symbol and \"beauty icon within the [B]lack community\". The media often used the term \"bootylicious\"\u2014a portmanteau of \"booty\" and \"delicious\"\u2014in reference to her curvaceous figure; the phrase was popularized by Destiny's Child's 2001 single of the same name.[445][446] In 2004, \"bootylicious\" was added to the Oxford English Dictionary, defined as \"(of a woman) sexually attractive\".\n\nKnown for her \"diva\" persona, Beyonc\u00e9 has been nicknamed \"Queen Bey\" (also spelled \"Queen B\") by the media.
