The songstress and husband Jay Z have kept a lid on the details about the new additions to their family, but sources close to the couple have confirmed the happy news to various media outlets. One insider told People: \u201cBey and Jay are thrilled and have started sharing the news with their family and closest friends.\u201d While Beyonc\u00e9 had previously revealed she was expecting twins, as of right now the babies\u2019 sex and names are still unknown.\n\nMeanwhile, Kim Kardashian has already been accused of trying to steal Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s thunder. The accusations started to fly when Kim purchased a Pomeranian puppy for her daughter North West \u2013 and broke the news just as Beyonc\u00e9 is thought to have given birth. While the timing was somewhat suspicious, Kim took it one step further by asking fans for help in naming the dog. She tweeted: \u201cSo North wants to name her puppy Mercy, thoughts? We need a good name!\u201d This, of course, briefly diverted some of the attention away from new mum Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nKim and Beyonc\u00e9 have both run in the same celebrity circles for many years thanks to the friendship between their husbands Kanye West and Jay Z. That said, there have been countless reports about their allegedly frosty relationship. In fact, just last year it was claimed that Bey has \u201cnever liked genuinely liked Kim\u201d. A source told Mail Online:\n\nShe\u2019s mostly tolerated her because of their husbands\u2019 friendship and [their] mutual friends, like Jennifer Lopez. She is always a little icy to Kim. The last time they hung out, the minute Beyonc\u00e9 could leave the conversation, she did. They always have lots of awkward pauses.\n\nMoving forward\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that Kim will ever admit that she set out to outshine her \u2018rival\u2019 \u2013 nor is it likely that Beyonc\u00e9 will even be miffed about the poorly timed tweet at this stage. Instead, the pop star will no doubt be devoting all her energy into adjusting to life as a mum-of-three. However, it\u2019s always possible that the feud between Kim and Bey could flare up again sometime in the near future.\n\nPhoto by thekrisharris licensed under Creative commons 4", "images": ["http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Honey-480x240.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/xDr-Bailey-Feature-80x60.jpg.pagespeed.ic.M4KEKZCeNb.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/xMasquerade-80x60.jpg.pagespeed.ic.dk83GeeQ7F.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xLu-Rou-Fan-80x60.jpg.pagespeed.ic.JXorKL-WnB.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/xJohn-K-Pierre-80x60.jpg.pagespeed.ic.PMYKN2Y-TN.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/kreol_magazine_logo.png", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/xKreol-Magazine-Logo-750x400.jpg.pagespeed.ic.zURNS_5vsK.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/xjudge-ulysses-gene-thibodeaux-80x60.jpg.pagespeed.ic.jgM6r2YLmO.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xAlways-and-Forever-80x60.jpg.pagespeed.ic.3r-Ocm5ZcO.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/xKreol-Magazine-Logo-360x240.jpg.pagespeed.ic.LMhh_ATKNp.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/xGreg-Arceneaux-80x60.jpg.pagespeed.ic.aeLyOm6lyh.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kreol-Covers-25.gif", "https://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Kreol-Magazine-Logo-scaled.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/xNeutral-80x60.jpg.pagespeed.ic.OQXfk0TQTH.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/x1_Pointe-Marie_Aerial-View-from-River-Road2-80x60.jpg.pagespeed.ic.ud3lH2rChG.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/xLead_Vicent-80x60.jpg.pagespeed.ic.kMEXxnW-zA.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xJudge-Darrel-James-Papillion-80x60.jpg.pagespeed.ic.inHxCf_5cn.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Paul-K-studio-480x240.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xChicken-Sate-80x60.jpg.pagespeed.ic.oTpwC6wQFW.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/xGeneral-Honore-6-2-80x60.jpg.pagespeed.ic.WV8GxowsAF.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/xKreol-Magazine-Logo-480x240.jpg.pagespeed.ic.OYG2lx7H5E.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kim_kanye-360x240.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Madonna-480x240.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/xhellions-80x60.jpg.pagespeed.ic.Ts2UzvHj29.jpg", "http://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/xBindu-Morjaria-Lead-80x60.jpg.pagespeed.ic.9GWz2C6DJ7.jpg"], "top_img": "https://kreolmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Kreol-Magazine-Logo-scaled.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://kreolmagazine.com/culture/features/did-kim-kardashian-try-to-steal-beyonces-thunder/", "title": "Did Kim Kardashian try to steal Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s thunder?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 has finally given birth!
