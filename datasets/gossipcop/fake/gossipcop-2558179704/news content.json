They have been married since 2014 and have six children.\n\nThis month, the Australian paper New Idea claims that Pitt and Bullock have been \"discreetly\" going out in \"secret dates and private phone calls\" and the report maintains that the two are \"taking things 'to the next level.'\"\n\n\"They've always moved in the same crowd but the timing has been wrong \u2013 either he's been with someone, or she has. But now they're finally free to take their chemistry to the next level,\" New Idea's unnamed source added.\n\nThe same New Idea report was also the one to spill that \"insiders confirm\" Clooney built up the grounds for Pitt and Bullock to start dating.\n\nHowever, a recent report from PEOPLE magazine refutes the claims that Pitt is dating anybody. According to the publication, Pitt is savoring every moment of his single life and is not rushing to look for a new love.\n\nOn the other hand, PEOPLE's source shares that while Pitt is not dating anyone, the \"Allied\" actor has finally found the time to welcome back old friends to his life, which is one of the factors that have been helping him move on from the recent failed marriage with Jolie.\n\nAside from spending time with old friends and his kids, Pitt reportedly developed an affinity for sculpture while working on a lineup of movies which he will either star in or produce, PEOPLE adds.", "images": ["https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/icon/share-outline.svg", "https://cdn.christianpost.com/assets/img/favicons/apple-touch-icon.png",
