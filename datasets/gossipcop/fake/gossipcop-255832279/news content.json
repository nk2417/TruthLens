In the picture, Caitlyn \u2014 dressed in a silk robe \u2014 holds a glass of champagne while sitting on the edge of a bathtub where former wife Kris Jenner is appears to be nude and covered in bubbles.\n\n\u201cTGIF,\u201d Kardashian West captioned the shot.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for social media to react, many questioning why the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star was posting a picture of her estranged family member.\n\n\u201cPetty at its finest,\u201d commented one Instagram user on her post.\n\nOthers shared the shot on Twitter, asking, \u201cIs this Kim throwing shade at Caitlyn or is it just me?\u201d\n\nPerhaps one tweeter put it best: \u201cWHAT DOES THIS MEAN!?\u201d\n\nSource: Caitlyn Jenner/Instagram\n\nIt has, after all, been well over a year since Caitlyn and Kardashian West spoke.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t talk to [the Kardashians] anymore. Kim, I haven\u2019t talked to in a year,\u201d Caitlyn said in November while discussing her memoir at the U.K.\u2019s Cambridge Union, according to Cambridge News.\n\nAlthough Kardashian West publicly supported Jenner\u2019s transition, she cut ties after reading her book Secrets of My Life, which alleged Kris knew more about her gender identity crisis than she\u2019s admitted \u2014 a claim Kris denies.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Simpson was guilty of having killed wife Nicole Brown Simpson and waiter Ron Goldman \u2014 despite having served as the NFL star\u2019s defense attorney in his 1994 murder trial.\n\n\u201cMy relationship with Caitlyn was strained,\u201d the mother of three said during the episode, which aired in October. \u201cI was just trying to be respectful. But if you talk about my dad, I will cut you.\u201d\n\nSource: Kim Kardashian/Instagram\n\nThings surely couldn\u2019t have been helped by comments Caitlyn made in January when she admitted on ITV\u2019s Piers Morgan\u2019s Life Stories that she \u201cdidn\u2019t trust\u201d the Kardashians and chose to keep the last few pages of her memoir from them when sharing advanced copies.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want them to leak it to the press, okay?\u201d Jenner said, adding that those pages were the ones in which she wrote about her decision to have gender confirmation surgery to transition from male to female. \u201cThere was no reason for them to know about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t tell anybody. Why? It\u2019s none of their business,\u201d Jenner continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Caitlyn Jenner Reveals She Had Skin Cancer Removed from Her Nose: \u2018Always Wear Your Sunblock!\u2019\n\nThough her relationship with step-children Kourtney Kardashian and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian remains rocky, Jenner is still in daughters Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner\u2019s lives. The Olympic icon even attended Kendall\u2019s 22nd birthday bash in November at Petit Taqueria restaurant in Los Angeles, along with Kris and Kardashian West.\n\n\u201cKris and Caitlyn only had a brief interaction to say hello, but everyone seemed fine,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cThey were all focused on making it a special birthday for Kendall.\u201d\n\nShe was also quick to celebrate the arrival of Kylie\u2019s baby girl Stormi in February, sharing a throwback photo of her 20-year-old daughter on Instagram. \u201cMy daughter just had a daughter,\u201d Caitlyn wrote in the photo\u2019s caption. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to be by your side through this journey. She\u2019s SO beautiful already. Can\u2019t wait to watch her grow. Throwback to my baby, as a baby @kyliejenner.\u201d\n\nAnd despite their estrangement, in April 2017, Kardashian West told Ellen Degeneres that she would \u201calways love her\u201d for helping raise her and her sisters.", "images":
