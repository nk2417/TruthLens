After their viral Met Gala dance-off, MTV UK interviewed Tom about Taylor in a video posted on May 16. (Taylor and Calvin announced their breakup on June 1, for reference.)\n\nJust how many times did Tom compliment Taylor in 53-second segment? Four.\n\n1. \"I sat next time to her at dinner that night, and she was very charming.\"\n\n2. \"She is amazing.\"\n\n3. \"I mean, I've seen a couple of her videos, and I think, I remember 'Shake It Off' was released around the time we made I Saw the Light. She's very cool, yeah.\"\n\n4. When asked about doing a duet with her, \"I don't know that I could stand up to her vocal talents, to be honest. That's what she does. She's a professional musician and I'm an actor. We'll see. You never know. But I'm pretty sure we won't do it.\"\n\nRight before Taylor and Calvin dated, for comparison, Calvin told an interviewer he would swipe left on her on Tinder because \"she looks lovely [but] she's the opposite of my type.\" Then, post-awards-show kisses/months later, he told a radio station Taylor checks off \"boxes I didn't even know existed.\"", "images":
