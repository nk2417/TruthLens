However, the rumor mill died down a little when Kelly went on to host her show alone, and Michael landed Good Morning America and despite the passive aggressive interviews that Kelly gave since Michael\u2019s departure (if we can call it that), things between the former co-hosts seemed to have died down a little.\n\nHowever, Michael Strahan\u2019s new game show \u2018The $100,000 Pyramid\u2019 has been making waves recently, both with ratings and guest stars. ABC has confirmed that stars like Rachael Ray, Tom Bergeron, Aaron Rodgers, and Cam Newton will all be appearing on the second season of \u2018The $100,000 Pyramid\u2019 when it returns in June.\n\nThe show has been gaining steam on the game show circuit, and as its been amassing a large fan base and impressive ratings, Kelly Ripa has allegedly felt even more slighted than she did before.\n\nShe was reportedly already jealous of the fact that Michael\u2019s star was rising so quickly, and the fallout from their final days together on the show certainly didn\u2019t help. Plus, the fact that he was immediately inundated with offers from other shows and higher rated shows, at that, reportedly made her seethe more, even though she had to put on a confident facade for the show.\n\nBut alas, there\u2019s only so long that she can keep faking the fact that she doesn\u2019t care about Michael\u2019s success off the show, especially as she still struggles to find longer term co-hosts who\u2019ll put up with her alleged attitude problems and diva behavior.\n\nWhat do you guys think about Kelly Ripa\u2019s jealousy over Michael Strahan\u2019s new career successes? Do you think she\u2019s still bitter over her former co-star\u2019s ratings bonanza, or has she moved on?
