Roger Moore, the second actor to play James Bond on the big screen, died Tuesday at the age of 89. Though Moore was neither the most famous nor most acclaimed version of Bond (even he ranked himself fourth), he did play the character the longest, in seven films stretching from 1973 to 1985. As EW\u2019s Chris Nashawaty wrote in a 2008 profile, \u201cMoore played 007 more times than any other actor. By rights of possession, he owns the part.\u201d So perhaps it\u2019s no surprise that Moore\u2019s death has invited a trove of remembrances and tributes from people across the pop culture spectrum.\n\nIn addition to spying, Moore was also a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador from 1991 until his death, working for humanitarian causes to help the world\u2019s children. After his death, UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lane issued a statement.\n\n\u201cWith the passing of Sir Roger Moore, the world has lost one of its great champions for children \u2013 and the entire UNICEF family has lost a great friend,\u201d Lane said in his statement. In his most famous roles as an actor, Sir Roger was the epitome of cool sophistication; but in his work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, he was a passionate \u2013 and highly persuasive \u2013 advocate for children. He once said that it was up to all of us to give children a more peaceful future. Together with Lady Kristina, he worked very hard to do so. All of us at UNICEF extend our deepest sympathies to the Moore family, and join his many friends and admirers from around the world in paying tribute to his life and mourning his loss. He will be deeply missed.\u201d\n\nCheck out a sample of Moore goodbyes below.", "images":
