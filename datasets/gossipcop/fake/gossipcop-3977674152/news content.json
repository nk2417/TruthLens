Stars like Leonardo DiCaprio, Angelina Jolie, and Natalie Portman use their influence for good, doing philanthropy work and fighting for their causes\n\nIn the piece, which was first published in July last year and resurfaced on Sunday, December 11, the Suits star, 35, opened up about the hardships she\u2019s faced as an \u201cethnically ambiguous\u201d talent in showbiz.\n\n\u201cBeing \u2018ethnically ambiguous,\u2019 as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role. Morphing from Latina when I was dressed in red, to African-American when in mustard yellow; my closet filled with fashionable frocks to make me look as racially varied as an \u201980s Benetton poster,\u201d wrote Markle, whose dad is Caucasian and mother is African American. \u201cSadly, it didn\u2019t matter: I wasn\u2019t black enough for the black roles, and I wasn\u2019t white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn\u2019t book a job.\u201d\n\nGiven the challenges Markle faced in her career because of her unique look, the Los Angeles native \u2014 who is currently dating Prince Harry \u2014 explained that playing Rachel Zane on Suits was a dream role because producers didn\u2019t cast the part with a specific ethnicity in mind.\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Stars \u2014 They\u2019re Just Like Us! They may live in the spotlight, but these stars have no problem doing every day tasks\n\n\u201cThe series was initially conceived as a dramedy about a N.Y. law firm flanked by two partners, one of whom navigates this glitzy world with his fraudulent degree. Enter Rachel Zane, one of the female leads and the dream girl \u2014 beautiful and confident with an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. \u2018Dream girl\u2019 in Hollywood terms had always been that quintessential blond-haired, blue-eyed beauty \u2014 that was the face that launched a thousand ships, not the mixed one,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut the show\u2019s producers weren\u2019t looking for someone mixed, nor someone white or black for that matter. They were simply looking for Rachel. In making a choice like that, the Suits producers helped shift the way pop culture defines beauty.\u201d\n\nMarkle continued: \u201cThe choices made in these rooms trickle into how viewers see the world, whether they\u2019re aware of it or not. Some households may never have had a black person in their house as a guest, or someone biracial. Well, now there are a lot of us on your TV and in your home with you. And with Suits, specifically, you have Rachel Zane. I couldn\u2019t be prouder of that.\u201d\n\nThe brunette beauty\u2019s essay comes just over a month since her royal beau, 32, spoke out against those who have criticized her amid news of their romance. As previously reported, Harry publicly acknowledged his relationship with Markle in a statement released on November 8.\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: 15 Charming Throwback Photos of the Royal Family Us Weekly rounds up 15 charming throwback photos of the British royal family from the '80s and '90s \u2014 see unexpectedly adorable and silly pics of Prince William and Prince Harry here\n\n\u201cThe past week has seen a line crossed,\u201d read the one-page letter released by Harry\u2019s communications secretary, Jason Knauf. \u201cHis girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Some of this has been very public \u2014 the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cPrince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle\u2019s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her. It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is \u2018the price she has to pay\u2019 and that \u2018this is all part of the game.\u2019 He strongly disagrees. This is not a game \u2014 it is her life and his.\u201d\n\nHarry and Markle (who was previously married to film producer Trevor Engelson from 2011 to 2013) began dating in June.", "images":
