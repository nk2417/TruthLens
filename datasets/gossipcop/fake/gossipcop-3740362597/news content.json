Everybody says: \u2018Oh, you\u2019re an actor, you should be good at that.\u2019 It\u2019s just not true,\u201d he said. He was speaking at \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in, yesterday, where he received a special award for Irish people doing outstanding work abroad in sport, science, and the arts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very, very humbled and I\u2019m very, very proud to be Irish, especially today. I shall continue to fly the flag for Irish drama,\u201d he said, on receiving the Presidential Distinguished Service Award, from President Michael D Higgins.\n\nPresident Higgins said the actor had not only contributed to the arts, but also to humanity, through his 20 years as a Unicef Goodwill Ambassador.\n\n\u201cLast November, when I was presenting the Presidential Distinguished Service Award for contribution for the Irish abroad, Liam wasn\u2019t able to be with us, but he more than deserves a special occasion himself.\n\n\u201cWe started the awards in 2012, to give recognition to the Irish people living abroad who had made a distinguished contribution, not just to Ireland, but to humanity in general and, indeed, that is the case with Liam Neeson,\u201d Mr Higgins said.\n\nThe President also spoke of the \u201cIrish family\u201d and how it is not defined by political or geographic borders, but instead shared values.\n\n\u201cI think our reason for having the awards was to say that the Irish family isn\u2019t defined by national borders or territories. It\u2019s defined by care, compassion, a shared culture and heritage, a common sense of responsibility, a consciousness of our historical experience, and also the importance of Ireland contributing dynamically to a future that would be more humane and more compassionate and more just.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is very, very clear, to absolutely everybody in this room, how Liam Neeson qualifies by all of those criteria\u201d.\n\nThe President also referred to the actor\u2019s contribution to the Irish film industry in the 1990s, when it was going through a difficult period.\n\n\u201cI want to say that, in that period between 1993 and 1997, when the Irish film industry was getting its second wind and going on to the strong internationally-recognised position it now is [in], Liam Neeson, and those like him, were outstanding in helping promote the Irish film industry,\u201d said President Higgins.\n\nHe also thanked the actor for his Unicef work. \u201cNow is the time, more than any other, when, in fact, children of the world are more vulnerable and deserve all our support.\u201d", "images":
