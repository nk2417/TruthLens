Ange has muddied his name too much and he\u2019s livid,\u2019 an insider told New Idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\nLast week, Brad and Ange reached an interim agreement, meaning the couple have agreed temporary custody issues for one month as an evaluation continues in Los Angeles.\n\n\u2018The interim arrangement was agreed upon by both parties after it was recommended by their custody evaluator,\u2019 a source explains.\n\nBut now experts claim that it may be too late, and Angelina\u2019s behaviour may have put the children at risk and created tension within the family unit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018The children will definitely be affected. They will feel anxious and insecure from the ongoing conflict and lack of a clear outcome,\u2019 clinical psychologist and parenting specialist Renee Mill tells New Idea.\n\n\u2018They will feel unsafe because of the hostility and aggression around them, which doesn\u2019t bode well for their ongoing mental health. Under these circumstances, they will begin to lose trust in their father.\u2019\n\nFurthermore, Renee says Angelina may be alienating the children and even suffering narcissistic and borderline personality traits. \u2018This is called parental alienation syndrome. Interestingly, the parent who alienates is commonly found to have narcissistic and borderline personality features,\u2019 says the expert.\n\n\u2018She appears selfish and intent on taking the kids wherever and whenever she wants. She is demanding, and doesn\u2019t consider the amount of money Brad has allegedly given to be enough, even though she has enough. She seems set out to destroy him and in her fervour, she is destroying her children\u2019s ability to form a healthy relationship with their father, which would give them balance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Borderline personality disorder people love to stir up arguments and have difficulty self-regulating, which also is tough on the kids,\u2019 Renee adds.\n\nClinical and paediatric psychologist Ernest R. Katz, agrees, saying that Ange\u2019s behaviour would have had a negative impact on the children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018In general, kids feel very connected to, and remain in contact with, both parents even during a divorce. If one parent is speaking negatively about the other, the children will feel stressed and conflicted,\u2019 Ernest told Hollywood Life.\n\n\u2018Kids will feel pressured and be put in a difficult position if they are being told not to spend time with one parent.\n\n\u2018These conflicted feelings can stay with children for a long time, and even through adulthood. It can impact their ability to live a happy, well-adjusted life,\u2019 Ernest adds. \u2018When one parent makes a child feel like they have to choose, it can lead to children having anxiety, depression, and traumatic stress reactions.\u2019\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea, on sale now.\n\nAdvertisement", "images": ["https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/31708/brad-and-ange.jpg?resize=1024%2C545", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d683f9a7086cf5b4d843157e497fddc673a3321799da7d0d3a9507a9b5e7998e?s=128&d=mm&r=g", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/chrissie-swan-the-shortcut-queen-691e509abfe28.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-20t164344.876-691eaa9997406.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/71038/michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-hollywood.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/32124/angelina.jpg?resize=1024%2C980", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/Logo-1.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/v_362_2025_ni-x-tefal-dolci-ice-cream-maker_v2_1920-x-1080-1-6916b146e3add.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/shanelle-dawson-690aa4bd7024e.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-07t093023.363-690d23867f4b8.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/icon-phosphor-circle.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/maddie-search-1-691296b6da0e9.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/oasis-tribute-1-690ad1b65d551.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/07/NIFLOGO_Organge.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/ni2546pm1_marketing-cover_v0.1-691a9098143bf-scaled.jpg?resize=1955%2C2560", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/christian-brueckner-flees-691692aca76cd.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/32010/new-idea-sep-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C655", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/air-fryer-1-691eadfe53bed.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/ethan-mchappy-day-1-690d8b0e3e45e.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/laos-poisoning-69155cac15dbd.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/10/wp-header-2025-10-17t095813.528-68f178954ec8f.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/32123/angelina-jolie-1.jpg?resize=1024%2C1007"], "top_img": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nikki Black", "Nikki Is Obsessed With All Things Celebrity", "Dreams She Is A Long-Lost Kardashian.
