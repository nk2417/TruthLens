She identifies as mixed race; \"My dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I'm half black and half white.\"[1] Her parents \u2013 the former makeup artist Doria Ragland (born 1956) and Thomas Markle Sr. (born 1944), a television lighting director and director of photography[2] \u2013 separated when she was two years old and divorced four years later.[3][4][5]\n\nMarkle reportedly has a close relationship with her mother.[6][7] Until the age of nine, both parents contributed to raising her; then, her father was left in charge of caring for her (while her mother pursued a career) so Meghan lived with him full-time before commencing university at age eighteen.[8][9] Markle Sr. worked as a director of photography and lighting for General Hospital and Married... with Children, and Meghan occasionally visited the set of Married... with Children as a child.[10][11] In later life, she became estranged from her father and paternal half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jr.[12][13]\n\nGrowing up in View Park\u2013Windsor Hills, Los Angeles,[14] Markle attended Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse.[15][16] At age eleven, she and her classmates wrote to Procter & Gamble to gender-neutralize a dishwashing soap commercial on national television.[17] She was raised as a Christian, though conflicting reports indicate she was raised either Catholic or Protestant.[18][19][20] She graduated from Immaculate Heart High School (Los Angeles), a fee-charging all-girls Catholic school.[21] Markle took part in plays and musicals at the school, where her father helped with lighting.[22] During her teenage years, she worked at a local frozen yogurt shop and a donut shop and later as a nanny and waitress.[23][24][25] She also volunteered at a soup kitchen in Skid Row, Los Angeles.[26][27]\n\nIn 1999, she was admitted to Northwestern University (NU) in Evanston, Illinois, where she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.[28][29][30] With other members of Kappa Kappa Gamma, Markle did volunteer work with the Glass Slipper Project. After her junior year, her uncle Michael Markle helped secure her an internship as a junior press officer at the American embassy in Buenos Aires,[31] and she considered a political career.[32][33] However, she did not score high enough in the Foreign Service Officer test to proceed further with the US State Department[34] and returned to NU. She also attended a study abroad program in Madrid.[29] In 2003, Markle earned her bachelor's degree with a double major in theater and international studies from Northwestern's School of Communication.[32][34]\n\nActing career\n\nAccording to Markle, she had some difficulty getting roles early in her career due to being \"ethnically ambiguous\" because \"I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones.\"[35] To support herself between acting jobs, she worked as a freelance calligrapher and taught bookbinding.[10][36] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital,[37][38] a show for which her father served as a lighting director.[39] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006) and CSI: NY (2006).[37] For her role in Century City, she told the casting directors that she was a SAG-AFTRA member when she was not, but after being cast, the employers were obliged to help her join the union according to the Taft\u2013Hartley Act.[40] Markle also did several contract acting and modeling jobs.

On November 8, eight days after the relationship was made public by the press, the prince directed his communications secretary to release a statement on his behalf to express personal concern about pejorative and false comments made about his girlfriend by mainstream media and internet trolls.[58][59] Later, in a letter to a British media regulator, Markle's representatives complained about harassment from journalists.[60] In September 2017, Markle and Prince Harry appeared together in public in Toronto at the Invictus Games, of which Harry is founding patron.[61][62]\n\nMeghan Markle's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017, by Harry's father Charles (then the Prince of Wales).[63] The announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by the British media and prompted generally positive comments about a mixed-race person as a member of the royal family,[64] especially in regard to Commonwealth countries.[8] Markle announced that she would retire from acting[65][66] and her intention to become a British citizen.[67]\n\nCarriage procession through streets of Windsor, May 2018\n\nIn preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptized Markle and confirmed her in the Church of England on March 6, 2018.[68] The private ceremony, performed with water from the River Jordan, took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.[68] The marriage ceremony was held on May 19 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[69] Her wedding dress was designed by Clare Waight Keller.[70] Markle later revealed that there was a private exchange of vows three days earlier, with the Archbishop of Canterbury in the couple's garden.[71] However, this private exchange of vows was not a legally recognized marriage.[72][73]\n\nAfter the wedding, the Duke and Duchess lived at Nottingham Cottage in London, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.[74] In May 2018, it was reported that they had signed a two-year lease on Westfield Large, located on the Great Tew Estate in the Cotswolds.[75] They gave up the lease after photos of the house and its interior were published by a paparazzi agency.[75] The couple considered settling at the twenty-one room Apartment 1 within Kensington Palace,[76] but moved to Frogmore Cottage in the Home Park of Windsor Castle instead.[77][78] The Crown Estate refurbished the cottage at a cost of \u00a32.4 million, paid out of the Sovereign Grant, with the Duke later reimbursing expenses beyond restoration and ordinary maintenance, a part of which was offset against rental payments that were due at the time.[79][80] Meghan gave birth to a son, Archie, on May 6, 2019.[81] The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's office moved to Buckingham Palace and officially closed on March 31, 2020, when the Sussexes withdrew from undertaking official royal engagements.[82][83] After some months in Canada and the United States, in June 2020, the couple bought a house on the former estate of Riven Rock, Montecito, California.[84][85] The next month, Meghan suffered a miscarriage.[86] She gave birth to a daughter, Lilibet, on June 4, 2021.[87] Meghan later revealed that she had suffered from postpartum preeclampsia.[88] The Duke and Duchess have owned a Labrador named Pula and two Beagles named Guy and Mamma Mia.[89][90] Meghan previously owned a Labrador-German Shepherd cross named Bogart.[91]\n\nPolitical views\n\nMarkle was politically vocal before marrying Prince Harry. At age 9, she and her friends reportedly campaigned against the Gulf War.[92] Decades later, she backed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 United States presidential election and publicly denounced her opponent and eventual winner, Donald Trump. In the same year, when the referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union resulted in favor of Brexit, Markle expressed her disappointment on Instagram.[93] In 2017, Markle recommended the book Who Rules the World? by left-wing intellectual Noam Chomsky on her Instagram account.[94]\n\nIn July 2018, Irish senator Catherine Noone tweeted that the Duchess was \"pleased to see the result\" of the Irish referendum on legalizing abortion. Meghan received criticism for potentially breaching the protocol that prohibits royals from interfering in politics;[95] She deleted her tweet and emphasized that her statement was misleading and \"the Duchess was not in any way political\".[95]\n\nAfter she returned to the United States and as an eligible voter, she released a video with her husband encouraging others to register for the 2020 United States presidential election on National Voter Registration Day. Some media outlets took it as an implicit endorsement of the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, which prompted then-president Trump to dismiss their messaging at a press conference.[96] In October 2021, she penned an open letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, advocating for paid leave for parents.[97] Her remarks were met by backlash from Republican representatives Jason Smith and Lisa McClain, who found her statement \"out of touch\" and criticized her interference with American politics while utilizing her British royal titles.[98] Meghan has reportedly lobbied senators from both parties on the issue of paid family leave, including Democratic senators Patty Murray and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as Republican senators Shelley Moore Capito and Susan Collins.[99][100] She has also publicly spoken in support of federal voting protections.[101]\n\nIn February 2022, she voiced her support for the Supreme Court nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson.[102] In June 2022, she publicly supported Moms Demand Action, an organization which campaigns for safer gun laws in the US.[103] In the same month, in an interview with Jessica Yellin for Vogue, Meghan criticized the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that abortion is not a protected constitutional right and voiced her support for the proposed Equal Rights Amendment.[104]\n\nPublic life\n\nRoyal duties\n\nGreeting the public in Belfast, March 2018\n\nAfter becoming engaged, Markle's first official public appearance with Prince Harry was at a World AIDS Day walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017.[105][106] On March 12, the 2018 Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey was the first royal event she attended with the Queen.[107] On March 23, Harry and Meghan made an unannounced day visit to Northern Ireland.[108] In total, Markle attended 26 public engagements prior to the wedding.[109] Meghan's first official engagement after marriage was on May 22, when she and her husband attended a garden party celebrating the charity work of King Charles III (then the Prince of Wales).[110]\n\nIn July 2018, Meghan's first official trip abroad as a royal was to Dublin, Ireland, alongside Harry.[111][112] In October 2018, the Duke and Duchess traveled to Sydney for the 2018 Invictus Games.[113] This formed part of a Pacific tour that included Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.[114][115] As representatives of the Queen, the couple were greeted warmly by crowds in Sydney, and the announcement of Meghan's pregnancy hours after their arrival delighted the public and media.[115][116] During their visit to Morocco in February 2019, the Duke and Duchess focused on projects centered on \"women's empowerment, girls' education, inclusivity and encouragement of social entrepreneurship\".[117] Meghan also participated in her husband's work as youth ambassador to the Commonwealth, which included overseas tours.[118][119]\n\nAs part of establishing a separate office from that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2019, the Duke and Duchess created an Instagram social media account, which broke the record for the fastest account at the time to reach a million followers.[120] In July 2019, the Duchess's security team were criticized for creating an empty zone of about 40 seats around her at Wimbledon where she was watching a match between Serena Williams and Kaja Juvan.[121] In August 2019, Meghan and her husband were criticized by environmental campaigners for using private jets regularly when taking their personal trips abroad, which would leave more carbon footprint per person compared to commercial planes. The criticism was in line with similar criticism faced by the royal family in June 2019, after it was claimed that they had doubled their carbon footprint from business travel.[122][123]\n\nAt ActionAid in South Africa, 2019\n\nIn September and October 2019, a Southern African tour included Malawi, Angola, South Africa and Botswana. Archie traveled with his parents, making it \"their first official tour as a family\".[124] Meghan completed 179 engagements in total in 2018 and 2019.[125]\n\nStepping back and subsequent public appearances\n\nIn January 2020, Meghan and Harry returned to the UK from a vacation in Canada and announced that they were stepping back from their role as senior members of the royal family and would balance their time between the United Kingdom and North America.[126][127] A statement released by the Palace confirmed that the Duke and Duchess were to cease to undertake royal duties as representatives of the Queen and would therefore no longer receive the relevant financial support.[128] The couple would retain their HRH styles but not use them.[128] The formal role of the Duke and Duchess was subject to a twelve-month review period, ending in March 2021.

In January 2018, she took all articles offline and deleted her social media accounts.[234] It is estimated that Markle's social media activities annually earned her about $80,000 from endorsements and sponsorships.[43] She rejoined Instagram in January 2025.[235] She was also known for socializing at Soho House.[236]\n\nMarkle became known through The Tig for her fashion sense,[46] releasing two fashion collections with Canadian clothing company Reitmans in 2015 and 2016.[234] The lines were based on her personal style and that of her Suits character.[46] Markle has cited Emmanuelle Alt as her style inspiration.[237][238] In 2016, she hosted USA Network's video series Power Lunch with Meghan Markle in collaboration with Lexus and Eater, discussing the culinary inspirations of five different New York kitchens.[239]\n\nIn 2015, Markle visited Malta after discovering an ancestor had been born there. Her trip was documented by Elle UK.[240][241] She was featured in the cover story for the October 2017 issue of Vanity Fair and the December 2017 issue of Elle France.[242][243] Shortly after her engagement to Prince Harry in 2017, she caused a surge of interest in Scottish retailer Strathberry after carrying one of its handbags to a public event.[244][245] This was reported as an indication that her fashion choices would produce results similar to the Kate Middleton effect.[244][246] After Markle and Prince Harry's first appearance as a couple, brands Mackage, Birks, R&R Jewelers, Crown Jewelers, and Everlane noted an upswing in their website hits and sales.[247][248][245] It was speculated that Markle's effect would be broader internationally because she already had a strong American appeal.[246] Consequently, the United States saw a boost in yellow gold jewelry sales in the first quarter of 2018.[249]\n\nIn 2018, Tatler included Meghan with other senior royal women on its list of Britain's best dressed people.[250] Following the announcement of her pregnancy, she appeared in a Karen Gee dress that resulted in the Australian designer's website crashing.[251] Fashion website Net-a-Porter ranked Meghan as one of the best dressed women in 2018.[252] She was nominated for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[253] In 2019, British brand Reiss reported a growth in profits after Meghan was seen wearing a mini dress by them on International Women's Day.[254] In 2022, the black Armani dress worn by Meghan during her Oprah interview was selected by the Fashion Museum, Bath, as Dress of the Year 2021.[255] In the same year, she was featured in the cover story for the 2022 Fall Fashion issue of The Cut.[256] There was controversy over her claim in the interview that she had been told at the premiere of The Lion King that her marriage resulted in rejoicing in South Africa similar to that seen at Nelson Mandela's release from prison in 1990.[257]\n\nIn 2018, Time selected Meghan as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World[258] and placed her on its shortlist for Person of the Year.[259] Her name appeared again on the listicle in 2021, and she and her husband were featured on one of the magazine's seven worldwide covers.[260] In 2019, the magazine named Meghan and Prince Harry among the 25 Most Influential People on the Internet.[261] She was also chosen as one of the 25 most influential women in the United Kingdom by British Vogue magazine in 2018, 2019, and 2021.[262][263][264] Her influence was also recognized in both the 2019 and 2020 editions of Powerlist, the 100 most influential Britons of African and Afro-Caribbean descent.[265] In 2022, she was named as one of the 50 Women Changing the World over the past year by Worth magazine.[266] In the same year, Variety named her as a stellar honoree for its Power of Women issue,[267][268] and Financial Times included her on its list of \"25 most influential women of 2022\".[269] In December 2022, Meghan was found to be the second most disliked member of the British royal family by statistics and polling company YouGov, behind her husband's uncle Prince Andrew.[270] In March 2023, The Independent included her on its \"Influence List 2023\".[271] Meghan and Harry's exit from the royal family was satirized in a 2023 episode of South Park.[272] In the same year, James Hibberd of The Hollywood Reporter named Meghan and Harry among the Hollywood losers of 2023.[273]\n\nFollowing Meghan and Harry's trip to Nigeria in May 2024, Lucia Stein of the ABC argued that the couple could have been used by the royal family, and added that \"perhaps how helpful they would have been\" had an agreement on a \"hybrid working model\" been achieved.[274] Among other things, she noted Meghan's style and meetings were extensively covered internationally.[274] In October 2025, Ranker rated her the most disliked celebrity in the United States, in its poll of 48,000 people.[275]\n\nPrivacy and the media\n\nCourt cases\n\nAssociated Newspapers Limited\n\nIn November 2016, the MailOnline was criticized for running an article on Markle's family background titled \"(Almost) Straight Outta Compton\", which triggered a response from Prince Harry's communications secretary.[14] Between 2019 and 2020, Meghan and Harry contributed to the book Finding Freedom through a third-party source.[276] Despite initially denying their involvement with the book,[277] their contributions to the book became apparent during her court case against Associated Newspapers who were trying to use the book in their defense.[278][279] In October 2019, Meghan filed a lawsuit against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), the publisher of The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline over the publication of a letter she had sent to her father.[280][281] Thomas Markle Sr. had provided the publisher with excerpts of the letter after five of his daughter's friends referenced it in a People article.[3][282][283] She subsequently received support from more than 70 female MPs from different parties who in an open letter condemned the use of \"outdated, colonial undertones\" against her in some national media outlets.[284] In May 2020, the court dismissed claims of the tabloid's alleged dishonesty and malice, as they were deemed either vague or irrelevant to the case.[285] In February 2021, the High Court of Justice found in a summary judgment that ANL's Mail on Sunday had invaded Meghan's privacy by publishing the letter,[286] and she won her claim for \"misuse of private information and copyright infringement\" in May 2021.[287] She was given a \u00a3450,000 down payment on her \u00a31.5 million legal fees as an interim payment, and pursuant to copyright law, her legal team asked for a front-page statement by The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline to acknowledge her legal victory.[288]\n\nAn appeal was subsequently launched by ANL in November 2021.[289] In December 2021, three senior appeal judges upheld the judgement of the High Court against ANL, prompting Meghan to call for reform of the tabloid industry.[290] In the same month, ANL's The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline published a front-page statement on Boxing Day acknowledging Meghan's victory, adding that there had been an agreement on \"financial remedies\".[291] In addition to covering a portion of Meghan's legal costs, the outlet agreed to pay her \u00a31 in damages for invading her privacy and a confidential sum for infringing her copyright.[292] They were also banned from naming Meghan's friends, who had spoken to People magazine about the letter in 2018.[292]\n\nOther cases and complaints\n\nIn November 2016, The Sun ran the headline \"Harry girl's on Pornhub\".[59] The outlet denied any smear after it was revealed that the clips were illegally uploaded scenes from the TV series Suits and not pornographic material.[59] They subsequently apologized via an official statement in February 2017.[293] In February 2018, a letter containing white powder and a racist note addressing Markle was sent to St James's Palace, triggering counter-terrorism and hate crime investigations by Scotland Yard.[294] Meghan and Harry obtained a formal apology in May 2019 from Splash News for privacy invasion at their Cotswolds residence.[295][296] In December 2019, PA Media retracted the publishing of a Christmas card photograph of Meghan, Harry, and their son Archie. The agency said that the photo was retracted because they had been advised that the photograph was \"not representative of the Christmas card sent by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\".[297] The couple had a legal warning issued to the press in general in January 2020 after the publication of paparazzi photographs.[298] In March 2020, the couple took Splash UK to court after Meghan and her son were photographed without permission in Canada during a \"private family outing\". The case was settled later that year with Splash UK agreeing to no longer take unauthorized photos of the family.[299] The Duke and Duchess announced in April that they would no longer cooperate with the Daily Mail, The Sun, Daily Mirror and Daily Express.[300] They won an apology in October from American news agency X17 for taking photographs of their son at their home using drones.[301]\n\nIn March 2021, ITV News reported Meghan had complained directly to ITV's CEO about Piers Morgan's comments on mental health following her interview with Oprah Winfrey.[302] Ofcom received over 57,000 complaints about the program including one from the Duchess of Sussex.[303][304] In the same month, it was reported that an American private investigator unlawfully handed over personal details about Meghan to The Sun, including her Social Security number, cell phone number and address, when she first started dating Prince Harry in 2016. Meghan and her husband condemned the \"predatory practices\" of the British tabloids, while The Sun stated that the investigator \"was instructed clearly in writing to act lawfully\", and they did not \"use the information he provided for any unlawful practice\".[305]\n\nIn July 2021, Meghan filed legal complaints against The Times for two separate articles, with the first one covering an unproven allegation from Robert Lacey's book that she had left an engagement in Fiji for not being appointed by UN Women as a goodwill ambassador and the second one claiming that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had refused to talk to Prince Harry after Prince Philip's funeral due to fears of a potential leak.[306][307] In January 2022, the couple jointly filed a legal complaint against The Times for an article reporting on Archewell raising less than $50,000 in 2020.[308] In the same month, she complained to the BBC regarding their five-part podcast Harry, Meghan and the Media, in which the presenter Amol Rajan stated that Meghan had \"apologized for misleading\" the Court of Appeal in her case against the Mail on Sunday.[309][310] The BBC responded by issuing a statement on its \"corrections and clarifications\" website to emphasize that she had \"apologized to the court for not remembering email exchanges\".[310]\n\nIn March 2022, Meghan's half-sister, Samantha Markle, filed a defamation lawsuit against her in Florida, accusing her of lying in the Oprah interview and disseminating false statements via her communications secretary for the book Finding Freedom and sought damages in excess of $75,000.[311][312] In June 2022, Meghan's initial motion to dismiss the case was rejected by a judge following amendments made by Samantha in her complaint.[313] She filed a second motion in the same month.[313][314] In addition to applying for the case to be dismissed, Meghan's lawyer also applied for the discovery process to be delayed, pending the outcome of the dismissal application.[315] A Florida judge later denied the application to halt the discovery process,[316] but dismissed the lawsuit in March 2023.[317] In April 2023, Samantha refiled the lawsuit with another amended complaint that covered statements made by Meghan in her Netflix docuseries as well.[318] The lawsuit was later dismissed with prejudice in March 2024, after a judge ruled that the claimant was unable to provide evidence of defamation.[319] Samantha later appealed the decision.[320]\n\nBetween December 2022 and January 2023, more than 25,000 complaints were submitted to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) about a column by Jeremy Clarkson in The Sun,[321] in which he stated that he hated Meghan \"on a cellular level\" and dreamed \"of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant, 'Shame!' and throw lumps of excrement at her.\"[322] On December 20, 2022, Conservative MP Caroline Nokes wrote to The Sun's editor, Victoria Newton, calling for \"action [to be] taken\" against Clarkson. The letter was signed by more than 60 cross-party MPs.[323] On December 23, The Sun issued an apology, stating \"columnists' opinions are their own\" but they \"regret the publication of this article\" and are \"sincerely sorry\".[324] On the following day, a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex described the apology as \"nothing more than a PR stunt\".[325] Clarkson said his column was a reference to a scene from the television series Game of Thrones and he later revealed that he had emailed Meghan and Harry on Christmas Day 2022 to apologise.[321][326] A spokesperson for the couple said Clarkson wrote solely to Harry and the article was not an isolated incident.[321] In February 2023, IPSO announced that it was launching an investigation about the article.[327] In June 2023, IPSO concluded that the column was sexist and contained a \"pejorative and prejudicial reference\" to Meghan's sex, but it rejected complaints that the piece raised an issue of fact, or was meant to harass her or included discriminatory references on the grounds of race.[328]\n\nBullying allegations and Oprah interview\n\nIn 2021, shortly before Meghan and Harry were due to be interviewed by Oprah Winfrey, Valentine Low reported in The Times that Meghan's former communications secretary, Jason Knauf, complained in October 2018 that her conduct at Kensington Palace had caused two personal assistants to quit and had undermined the confidence of a third employee,[329] prompting an investigation by Buckingham Palace into the bullying allegations.[330][331] The palace hired an external law firm to examine the claims, with ten aides reported to have cooperated with the review.[332][333] Criticism of Meghan for twice wearing earrings gifted from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2018, after he was accused of complicity in the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, appeared at the same time.[334][329][335] Her representatives denied her awareness of the accusations against Mohammed bin Salman and said The Times was being used by Buckingham Palace for \"a smear campaign\" against her.[336][329]\n\nThe television special Oprah with Meghan and Harry was broadcast on CBS on March 7, 2021.[337] Meghan spoke about her personal and royal life and public pressure. She claimed to have been contemplating suicide during her time as a working royal and complained of a lack of protection for her and her son while being part of the royal institution.[338] There was a wide and polarized reaction to the interview.[339]\n\nIn an updated epilogue for the couple's unauthorized biography, Finding Freedom by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, the authors claimed that \"two of the individuals mentioned in [Knauf's] email asked for any allegations made to HR about their experiences with Meghan to be rescinded\".[340] Speaking on behalf of the Duchess in a BBC documentary, Jenny Afia, a lawyer who represented Meghan in her case against ANL, stated that the bullying allegations were \"just not true\".[341] In June 2022, The Times reported that the results from the inquiry made Buckingham Palace modify some of the policies and procedures in its HR department, but the report would not be published to ensure the privacy of those who took part in it.[342] In September 2024 The Hollywood Reporter reported on complaints raised by American staff members about Meghan's behavior. Her spokesperson declined to comment.[343] In January 2025 Vanity Fair, who spoke with Meghan's employees, reported on their descriptions of her varying from \"lovely, genuine person\" to \"cold and withholding\", adding that a staff member with ties to Archetypes took a leave of absence while a number of others talked about quitting their jobs, taking long absences from work to avoid attention, or going through long-term therapy after working with her.[344]\n\nIn March 2019, European consulting firm 89up reported on their discovery of 1,103 highly connected Twitter accounts with more than two and a half million tweets in favor of Meghan, most of which appeared to be bots carrying out \"coordinated attacks\" on royal correspondents who had reported negatively on her.[345][346] In the same year, CNN had reported on research by Hope not Hate, stating that out of 5,200 \"abusive tweets directed at Meghan\" in January and February 2019, 3,600 came from a small group of trolls.[345] In March 2019, the royal family introduced new rules for followers commenting on its official social media accounts in response to the online abuse aimed at Meghan and her sister-in-law Catherine.[347]\n\nIn October 2021, Twitter analytics service Bot Sentinel alleged they found 83 accounts with a combined number of 187,631 followers that were possibly responsible for approximately 70% of the negative content posted about Meghan and Harry.[348][349][350] The report prompted an investigation by Twitter.[348] The company stated that it found no evidence of \"widespread coordination\" between the accounts and said that it had taken action against users who violated Twitter's conduct policy.[348] Bot Sentinel released three more reports in the following months.[351][352][353]\n\nIn January 2022, the BBC named Meghan and Harry among people whose photos and videos were used in fake instant profits advertisements and bitcoin-related investment schemes.[354]\n\nAmong theories widespread on social media, including Twitter and YouTube, were unfounded assertions that Meghan had faked her pregnancies, instead using surrogate mother(s), or that her children do not exist at all.[355][356][357] Meghan's half-sister, Samantha, was reported to have run multiple Twitter accounts that targeted Meghan.[358][359]\n\nTitles, styles and arms\n\nMeghan became a princess of the United Kingdom upon her marriage to Prince Harry, entitled to the style of Royal Highness.[360] After her marriage, she was styled \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex\". She also holds the titles of Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel.[361] She is the first person to hold the title \"Duchess of Sussex\".[362][363]\n\nFollowing the Duke and Duchess's decision to step back from royal duties in 2020, the couple agreed not to use the style of Royal Highness in practice or publicly, but they are still referred to as \"His/Her Royal Highness\" in legal and private settings.[364][365][366][367][368]\n\nDuring Meghan's trip to Nigeria in May 2024, Igwe Alfred Achebe, the Obi of Onitsha, and Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, the Oluwo of Iwo, gave her the chieftaincy titles Ada Mazi ( transl. 'the daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace') and Adetokunbo ( transl. 'royalty from across the seas').[133]\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nKey \u2020 Denotes films that have not yet been released\n\nTelevision\n\nBibliography\n\nBooks\n\nAuthored articles and
