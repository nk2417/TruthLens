She thought his partying days and larking around with the boys was a thing of the past. I imagine she\u2019ll find this humiliating and William will have come in for a pasting,\u201d says a source.\n\nThe couple will put on a united front when they travel to Paris for a state visit on Friday, but the ski trip has once again put the spotlight on William who has so far carried out just 13 days of royal engagements this year. The Queen, who has been in poor health, has clocked up 24 days of official duties.\n\nLast February, the Cambridges posed on the slopes of Courchevel where they enjoyed their first family ski holiday with George and Charlotte. This year, in contrast, William opted to hit the slopes solo with a group of male friends who included Guy Pelly, James Meade, and Tom Van Straubenzee.\n\nAccording to The Sun newspaper, Wills and his pals spent Sunday night dancing to the band Hussy and looked \u201cvery worse for wear\u201d after downing \u201cseveral drinks.\u201d William, who is stepping down from his job as an air-ambulance pilot later this year, does have a history for having fun when he\u2019s out with the boys. At Tom van Straubenzee\u2019s wedding four years ago\u2014which Kate had to miss because she was pregnant with Prince George\u2014William reportedly ended up losing part of his front tooth after he was knocked in the face accidentally by his friend Tom Inskip during a marathon drinking session.\n\nAccording to sources on the slopes, the champagne\u2014and spirits\u2014were flowing in Verbier last weekend. Wills and his friends were photographed enjoying a liquid lunch with 24-year-old Australian model Sophie Taylor who works at the Farinet nightclub and a 30-year-old British former beautician from Blackpool named Rosie Peate who they met during the vacation. The group drank British beer, wine, and Jagerbombs and seemed to be in high spirits, with the prince high-fiving Sophie Taylor at one point during the lunch. Later William and his friends met up with the girls at another posh bar where the drinking continued.", "images":
