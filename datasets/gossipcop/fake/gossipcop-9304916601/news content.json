Serena has been friends with Kim and with Beyonce for years\u2014she had no hesitation when it came to inviting them to her wedding, she just made it clear that she didn\u2019t want any drama.\u201d\n\nOutside of the awkwardness of Bey bumping into Kim at the bar, it seems that these two were able to bury their bad blood long enough to celebrate Serena\u2019s special day. \u201cSerena\u2019s wedding was amazing, and next to giving birth, it was the best day of her life,\u201d the source tells HollywoodLife.com. \u201cTo be surrounded by all her closest friends, and to share her special day with them, meant everything to Serena. She\u2019s grateful that Kim and Beyonce managed to put their differences aside in order to celebrate with her.\u201d\n\nMaybe the alcohol helped Kim and Bey chill things out? The two of them were standing at the VIP bar after Serena tied the knot with Alexis Ohanian on Nov. 16. Bey \u201cseemed to avoid Kim\u201d at the wedding, a source EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com, so when the two were side-by-side, they didn\u2019t act like they were BFFs. The two said hello, exchanged small talk, but not much out. \u201cThe exchange definitely looked a bit cold and icy.\u201d Considering that their respective significant others \u2013 namely Kanye West, 40, and JAY-Z, 47 \u2013 have some pipin\u2019 hot beef between them, it\u2019s no surprise that these two ladies gave each other the cold shoulder.\n\nWhile there\u2019s hope that Ye and JAY can squash the beef and become best buddies, like they once were, don\u2019t expect Bey and Kim to suddenly become besties. Bey \u201ccan\u2019t stand the whole reality TV thing,\u201d an insider EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com, adding that the \u201cFormation\u201d singer just doesn\u2019t have any respect for Kim and how she built her empire. Which, that\u2019s fine. If Kim and Bey want to remain icy, they better know that Serena\u2019s not going to get involved in this \u201ccold war.\u201d\n\nDo you think Kim and Bey will ever be friends, HollywoodLifers?", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/serena-williams-why-she-refuses-to-take-sides-between-kim-kardashian-beyonce-ftr.jpg?resize=384%2C216", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/serena-williams-guests.jpg?fit=440%2C317", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/serena-williams-why-she-refuses-to-take-sides-between-kim-kardashian-beyonce-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C350", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/serena-williams-guests-2.jpg?fit=440%2C296", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bgus_1061382_005.jpg?fit=293%2C440"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/serena-williams-why-she-refuses-to-take-sides-between-kim-kardashian-beyonce-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C350", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/19/serena-williams-kim-kardashian-beyonce-feud-wedding-run-in/", "title": "Serena Williams: Why She Refuses To Take Sides Between Kim Kardashian & Beyonce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Kim Kardashian and Beyonce might be beefin', but Serena Williams refused to get caught up in the middle of her friends' feud.", "google-site-verification": "Atm19DlLsEdntyQvdD3b8sMiONm67k-Es2Ds9GrBCvU", "news_keywords": "Beyonc\u00e9, Kim Kardashian, Serena Williams", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "amp-consent-blocking": "amp-ad,amp-iframe", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.7", "auto-social": "always", "author": "Jason Brow", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Serena Williams: Why She Refuses To Take Sides Between Kim Kardashian & Beyonce", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/19/serena-williams-kim-kardashian-beyonce-feud-wedding-run-in/", "description": "Serena Williams loves competition, but when it comes to Kim Kardashian versus Beyonce, HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned that the tennis icon doesn\u2019t want any \u2018drama,\u2019 so she\u2019s sitting this\u2026", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/serena-williams-why-she-refuses-to-take-sides-between-kim-kardashian-beyonce-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C350", "width": 620, "height": 350}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-19T16:29:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-28T16:32:10+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Serena Williams: Why She Refuses To Take Sides Between Kim Kardashian & Beyonce", "description": "Kim Kardashian and Beyonce might be beefin', but Serena Williams refused to get caught up in the middle of her friends' feud.", "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/serena-williams-why-she-refuses-to-take-sides-between-kim-kardashian-beyonce-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C350"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cropped-hlicon_COLOR.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511067600.0, "source": "http://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
