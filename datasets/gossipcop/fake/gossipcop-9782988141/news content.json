{"url": "people.com/books/catherine-oxenberg-book-daughter-nxivm/", "text": "Three months after first revealing the story of her daughter India\u2019s involvement with the group NXIVM, Dynasty star Catherine Oxenberg has decided to write a book to share her story with the hope it can also help others.\n\nHer memoir, CAPTIVE: A Mother\u2019s Crusade to Save Her Daughter From a Terrifying Cult, cowritten by PEOPLE contributor Natasha Stoynoff, will be released in Fall and will recount Catherine\u2019s estrangement from her 26-year-old daughter, India, and her attempt to rescue her from what she believes is a dangerous group.\n\n\u201cI was completely ignorant about these sorts of the dangers and traps associated with these so-called personal growth self help groups. It\u2019s an $11 billion, completely unregulated industry, so I reached out to a lot of experts for guidance,\u201d Catherine tells PEOPLE. \u201cWhat I learned along the way could help others [and] prevent them from falling into the same trap, know what warning signs to look for, and also to give hope to those parents that are struggling and who have lost children to similar situations.\n\n\u201cSo many people reached out to me when I went public saying, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m in the same situation. I\u2019m heartbroken, I\u2019ve lost my child. I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she adds.\n\nAllison Michael Orenstein\n\nIndia was 20 years old when she and her mother attended a meeting as part of a leadership seminar organized by NXIVM in 2011. While the meeting was supposed to provide methods for self-improvement, Catherine told PEOPLE she found the organization \u201cweird and creepy.\u201d India didn\u2019t have the same hesitations and immersed herself in the organization over the next few years.\n\nNXIVM has been around for 20 years, with approximately 16,000 people paying thousands of dollars for experiences like executive-coaching workshops. Run by Keith Raniere, 57, who is known as \u201cVanguard\u201d to members, NXIVM has offices throughout the country and in Mexico.\n\nWenn/Alamy\n\n\u201cThe mission of NXIVM is to help transform and, ultimately, be an expression of the noble civilization of humans,\u201d the organization states on their website.\n\nNot only do former followers dispute this claim, many have shared horror stories of allegedly having their skin branded with Rainere\u2019s initials and describe the group as a \u201ccult.\u201d\n\nLast April, Catherine claims she learned her daughter was also in potential danger.\n\nHer friend, Bonnie Piesse, 34, had left the group and warned Catherine that India was taking part in what Catherine calls a \u201csecret sisterhood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to save your daughter,\u201d Piesse told her, according to Catherine. \u201cYou need to save India.\u201d\n\nIn December, the New York Times reported that Justice Department has opened an investigation into NXIVM.\n\nRon Galella/WireImage\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t ease Catherine\u2019s immediate concerns for her daughter.\n\nCatherine previously told PEOPLE that she learned India was on a restrictive diet, suffered hair loss, and hadn\u2019t had her period in a year. Now she says she\u2019s told that India is eating more because \u201cthey\u2019re trying to look more normal,\u201d but says she\u2019s still worried.\n\nAfter Catherine decided to go public with her allegations in October, India became angry and further withdrew from her. Catherine tells PEOPLE that India was recently in Los Angeles, but wasn\u2019t willing to see her.\n\n\u201cShe was in L.A. and I was hoping that was a good sign, and I was very distressed when she flew back [to NXIVM\u2019s headquarters Albany],\u201d Catherine says. \u201cEven is she\u2019s not willing to see me, the fact that she\u2019s outside of their sphere of influence physically gave me hope.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m assuming they kept her on a tight leash so that they still had a lot of influence over her,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause if she [leaves the group], that\u2019s a tremendous blow to [NXIVM] considering she\u2019s been such a public figure for them. I think that that could be the death blow and I think they\u2019re doing everything they can to keep her in.\u201d\n\nAs India becomes more entangled in the controversial group, Catherine is writing the memoir in another attempt to save India.\n\nCAPTIVE will reveal the steps Catherine has taken to extract her daughter from what she considers a \u201cdangerous, mind-controlling cult\u201d in which she claims the women are treated like \u201cslaves.\u201d She also draws on interviews from former members and cult experts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve grown as a person through this experience [and] I\u2019ve become more inclusive,\u201d Catherine says. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer just about my daughter. It\u2019s about helping everybody who has suffered through this.\u201d", "images":
