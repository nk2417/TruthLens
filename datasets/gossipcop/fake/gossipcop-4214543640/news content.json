The 10-year-old prince also wore an Aston Villa FC scarf in the team\u2019s signature maroon and sky blue.\n\nMarc Atkins // Getty Images\n\nThe outing marks the first time George has been spotted outside Kensington Palace since December. As Harper\u2019s Bazaar has reported, the young prince\u2019s mom, Princess Catherine, underwent abdominal surgery in January for a health issue, and while doctors initially believed her condition was benign, tests following the operation found that cancer had been present. The Princess of Wales revealed as much in a personal video message shared through the palace\u2019s social media channels this March.\n\n\u201cThis of course came as a huge shock, and William and I have been doing everything we can to process and manage this privately for the sake of our young family,\u201d she said, adding that the hardest part of learning her diagnosis was finding a way to explain it to her kids: George, Charlotte, eight, and Louis, six.\n\n\u201cAs you can imagine, this has taken time. It has taken me time to recover from major surgery in order to start my treatment. But most importantly, it has taken us time to explain everything to George, Charlotte, and Louis in a way that is appropriate for them, and to reassure them that I\u2019m going to be okay,\u201d Kate said. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said to them, I am well, and getting stronger every day by focusing on the things that will help me heal, in my mind, body, and spirits.\u201d\n\nPrincess Kate is undergoing preventative chemotherapy. King Charles III is also battling his own cancer and undergoing outpatient treatment.", "images":
