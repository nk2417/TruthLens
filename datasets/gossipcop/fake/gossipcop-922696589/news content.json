After promoting the reality competition on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon last week, the singer appeared on NBC\u2019s The Today Show Tuesday (Mar. 7) to give morning viewers a taste of her fighting spirit.\n\nWhile sitting down with Today\u2018s co-anchors Willie Geist and Carson Daly, the singer \u2014 who was appropriately displayed on screen with the headline \u201cThis Girl Is Still On Fire\u201d \u2014 discussed motherhood, her singing career, and how they have influenced her judging role on The Voice. Both hosts were intrigued by the \u201cgirl crush\u201d between Keys and her fellow coach, Gwen Stefani, even comparing their connection to the bromance of Blake Shelton and Adam Levine. But perhaps the most notable thing Keys said about her relationship with her fellow female coach is that it\u2019s even stronger than the one Stefani has with Shelton.\n\nWith a laugh and grin from ear to ear, the \u201cIn Common\u201d songstress joked \u201cwe love each other more than Blake and Gwen love each other, straight up!\u201d Shelton and Stefani \u2014 who have been dating for about 16 months \u2014 have been a guilty pleasure for viewers, as their fairytale romance is on full display each episode, especially this season.\n\nKeys described her working chemistry with Gwen as \u201camazing\u201d due to their long friendship. The singer had nothing but positive things to say about her experience as a judge calling it \u201cfun\u201d and boasting about the love that all the coaches share for one another.\n\nWatch the interview below:", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/alicia-keys-the-voice-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/alicia-keys-the-voice-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=628&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/alicia-keys-the-voice-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Da'Shan Smith", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/alicia-keys-gwen-stefani-relationship-blake-shelton-the-voice-today-show-interview-video-7717050/", "title": "Alicia Keys Says She Loves Gwen Stefani More Than Blake Shelton Does: Watch", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Alicia Keys appears on 'The Today Show' and confesses her love for Gwen Stefani while promoting 'The Voice.'", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Da'Shan Smith", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Alicia Keys Says She Loves Gwen Stefani More Than Blake Shelton Does: Watch", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/alicia-keys-gwen-stefani-relationship-blake-shelton-the-voice-today-show-interview-video-7717050/", "description": "Alicia Keys appears on 'The Today Show' and confesses her love for Gwen Stefani while promoting 'The Voice.'", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/alicia-keys-the-voice-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Alicia Keys"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-03-07T18:25:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-03-07T18:29:30+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Alicia Keys appears on 'The Today Show' and confesses her love for Gwen Stefani while promoting 'The Voice.'", "site": "@billboard", "creator": "@nightshawn101", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Alicia Keys Says She Loves Gwen Stefani More Than Blake Shelton Does: Watch", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/alicia-keys-the-voice-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488911136.0, "source": "http://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
