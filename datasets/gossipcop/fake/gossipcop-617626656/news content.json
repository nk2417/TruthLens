Image from Facebook[/caption] As a journalist covering films and entertainment, these are first few thoughts I chanced upon/overheard about the world\u2019s highest paid Girl Next Door_,_ Jennifer Aniston. News of her divorce with (now-ex) husband Justin Theroux made headlines on 16 February, and it\u2019s all anyone can talk/opine about. As is common with news of this nature (by which I mean one that dominates pop culture), what followed next were memes about Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston now being single (hey, have we forgotten Angie is single too?).\n\nBrad Pitt about to drive by Jennifer's house like...#JenniferAniston pic.twitter.com/TRNL9LQaq7 \u2014 Jackie (@Jackieannroth) February 15, 2018\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nJennifer Aniston: single \u2714\ufe0f\n\nBrad Pitt: single \u2714\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/glMAiNSQXz \u2014 La Colox \ud83e\udda9 (@soyluluuu) February 16, 2018\n\nSomewhere, Jennifer Aniston is crafting her \"Hey, let's grab coffee and catch up\" text to Brad Pitt. https://t.co/pXLGo7O4Mp \u2014 Madeline Hill (@mad_hill) February 15, 2018\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nMe: *reading about Jennifer Aniston & Justin Theroux split* awww that sucks\n\nAlso me: planning Jennifer Aniston & Brad Pitt's second wedding \u2014 Ally Reid (@ashallann) February 16, 2018\n\nMy reaction to Jennifer Aniston separation news\ud83d\ude2dbut realized both her and Brad Pitt are single\ud83d\ude0a pic.twitter.com/RJj9UWxgxg \u2014 Hanii (@HaniLee1) February 15, 2018\n\nNow who doesn\u2019t like a bunch of funny memes? But humour notwithstanding, there are several issues with our response to Aniston\u2019s breakup. First of all, it\u2019s a break up. Need I remind any of you what it feels like to end ties with someone who was your partner for over five years (married for 2, together for 7)? It feels like the pits. The last thing you want to do is scroll through twitter and find your face attached to way too many memes about getting back together with a man that left you for another woman. Pretty sure Jennifer, right now, is thinking \u201cthanks but no thanks\u201d. We are so obssessed with happy-endings and romance that practicality, self-happiness seem to matter very little. Has it occurred to noone that maybe, just maybe, Jennifer Aniston wants to be alone? That after a whirlwind of two marriages and much heartbreak, maybe it would better for her to be by herself? Would that be too bad? Why is it so hard for us to imagine Jennifer Aniston being alone? Or single? Does being single automatically mean someone is not happy? Remember, the statement that those two gave out with the news of their divorce was this: \u201cThis decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\u201d Doesn\u2019t sound any bit the heartbreak to me. If anything, Jennifer Aniston is probably happier being by herself and away from the world\u2019s baggage involving her love life. Besides, I\u2019d like to see people trying so hard to couple up the single male actors in Hollywood. Suggesting that Jennifer Aniston can only be happy if she\u2019s with a man, married or in a relationship is not only a perfect example of everyday sexism, it is also shortsighted. Besides, in my humble opinion, Aniston is way beyond Brad Pitt\u2019s league. If she *had* to get together with someone in the near future, I sincerely hope it is with someone new.\n\nLeo DiCaprio, single at 43: wow, LAD what a legend.\n\n\n\nJennifer Aniston, single at 49: what\u2019s wrong with her? Why can\u2019t she find love? Why can\u2019t she hang on to a man?#everydaysexism \u2014 kellyjackson88.bsky.social (@Kelly_Jackson88) February 16, 2018\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nIt\u2019s so insulting to Jennifer Aniston that anyone would suggest she\u2019ll get back with Brad Pitt now she\u2019s single. I really hope she doesn\u2019t! \u2014 Serena Marchetta (@SerenaEvelyn) February 16, 2018", "images": ["https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/09/Firstpost-2025-09-09T205729.126-2025-09-1619987534e98984bda376c28e635124.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(284,159)", "https://www.firstpost.com/dlxczavtqcctuei/news18/static/images/fp/yt-channel.png", "https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Jennifer-Aniston_Reuters_380.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(596,336)", "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/09/vp2-2025-09-4cef7b781dde654e4e8eaafb8f8f8902.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(284,159)", "https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Jennifer-Aniston_Reuters_380.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "https://www.firstpost.com/dlxczavtqcctuei/news18/static/images/fp/firstpost-placeholder.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(134,134)", "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/02/Firstpost-2025-02-06T143942.494-2025-02-5fc9cf82949b92e2d581c52ed61804f0.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(284,159)", "https://www.firstpost.com/dlxczavtqcctuei/news18/static/images/fp/fp-logo.png", "https://www.firstpost.com/dlxczavtqcctuei/news18/static/images/fp/fp-logo-sm.jpg", "https://www.firstpost.com/dlxczavtqcctuei/news18/static/images/fp/firstpost-desktop.png", "https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/09/QATAR-SECURITY1200-2025-09-c4cbaa76c838f78a6c13b1d7a6232799.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(284,159)", "https://www.firstpost.com/dlxczavtqcctuei/news18/static/images/fp/firstpost-placeholder.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(156,87)"], "top_img": "https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Jennifer-Aniston_Reuters_380.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/jennifer-aniston-doesnt-need-your-consolation-advice-or-brad-pitt-to-validate-her-existence-4354289.html", "title": "Jennifer Aniston doesn't need your consolation, advice or Brad Pitt to validate her existence", "meta_data": {"buildtime": "2025-09-12 18:09:06.916772 +0530 IST m=+176.196160126", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Suggesting that Jennifer Aniston can only be happy if she's with a man, married or in a relationship is not only a perfect example of everyday sexism, it is also shortsighted.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "keywords": "Hollywood,InMyOpinion,Brad Pitt,Angelina Jolie,Jennifer Aniston", "news_keywords": "Hollywood, InMyOpinion, Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Jennifer Aniston", "og": {"title": "Jennifer Aniston doesn't need your consolation, advice or Brad Pitt to validate her existence", "description": "Suggesting that Jennifer Aniston can only be happy if she\u2019s with a man, married or in a relationship is not only a perfect example of everyday sexism, it is also shortsighted.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/jennifer-aniston-doesnt-need-your-consolation-advice-or-brad-pitt-to-validate-her-existence-4354289.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Jennifer-Aniston_Reuters_380.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "category": "entertainment", "locale": "fp_IN", "site_name": "Firstpost"}, "fb": {"pages": 122176787772, "app_id": 964288731082630}, "article": {"section": "entertainment", "published_time": "2018-02-16T17:15:48+05:30", "modified_time": "2018-02-16T17:17:54+05:30"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Jennifer-Aniston_Reuters_380.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)", "title": "Jennifer Aniston doesn't need your consolation, advice or Brad Pitt to validate her existence", "description": "Suggesting that Jennifer Aniston can only be happy if she\u2019s with a man, married or in a relationship is not only a perfect example of everyday sexism, it is also shortsighted.", "site": "@Firstpost", "url": "https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/jennifer-aniston-doesnt-need-your-consolation-advice-or-brad-pitt-to-validate-her-existence-4354289.html"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518781548.0, "source": "http://www.firstpost.com", "summary": ""}
