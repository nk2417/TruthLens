Lindsay, who has a 5-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, \u201cunderstands that Ben needs to be there for his children,\u201d says the source, \u201cbut she found it strange that he went to the marital home and spent the night.\u201d\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nEven though she tried to brush off his overnight stay, she couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that \u201cevery time things seem to be going well, something happens to remind her that Jen and the kids come first,\u201d according to the source.
