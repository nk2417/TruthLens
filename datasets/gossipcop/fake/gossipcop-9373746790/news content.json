Sel is the most followed person on Instagram with a whopping 127 million followers, so of course the show would love to have a judge who can reach so many people.\n\n\u201cThey are putting together a proposal for her and are hoping she will accept it and join the show, it\u2019s a long shot but they are taking the chance to get her. They\u2019d love to have her signed up and all judges by mid October,\u201d our insider adds. So far the show has been striking out right and left when it comes to getting other stars to join Katy on the panel. ABC reportedly spent a whopping $25 million to land her back in May, which is over half of the show\u2019s budget. As a result, they don\u2019t have much money left over to get other top names. After all, who wants to do the same job as Katy for a fraction of the paycheck? Especially in Selena\u2019s case, she is the bigger star these days! See pics of beautiful Selena, right here.\n\nIf by some chance Selena actually agrees to join the show, they definitely need a \u201cnice\u201d judge cause Katy said she won\u2019t be holding back when it comes to the contestants\u2019 talent. She called in to On Air With Ryan Seacrest on Aug. 23, to give her judging strategy. \u201cI\u2019m going to maybe be more the Simon Cowell. I really respect him. As much as people said, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s grumpy or he\u2019s mean,\u2019 he was just truthful, you know? He\u2019s seen it. I don\u2019t need to be there to win the popular race.\u201d She added, \u201cHonestly sob stories come second for me. Everyone has a situation and God bless them\u2026but if you don\u2019t have the goods, you don\u2019t have the goods.\u201d Brutal!\n\n\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think it would be a good career move for Selena to join American Idol? Or would be it be a big step down?", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/GettyImages-2153303094-1.jpeg?fit=440%2C350", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/selena-gomez-rex-gallery-02.jpg?fit=379%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/will-selena-gomez-be-an-american-ldol-judge-producers-giving-her-an-offer-says-source-ftr-1.jpg?fit=800%2C452", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Selena-Gomez-Brooklyn-Beckham-Nicola-Peltz.jpg?fit=440%2C293"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/will-selena-gomez-be-an-american-ldol-judge-producers-giving-her-an-offer-says-source-ftr-1.jpg?fit=800%2C452", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/09/19/selena-gomez-american-idol-judge-producers-making-offer/", "title": "Will Selena Gomez Be An \u2018American ldol\u2019 Judge?
