We got a taste of what\u2019s coming this weekend, when two full-length tracks (featuring Migos, Young Thug, and ASAP Rocky) plus one snippet surfaced online.\n\nIn a recent appearance on Ebro in the Morning, Chance The Rappernoted that Kanye is working with Francis from Francis and the Lights on Ye\u2019s next album. Kanye has also reportedly been working with Pusha T.\n\nAccording to a previous report from TMZ, Kanye has been doing this work \u201choled up\u201d somewhere in Wyoming for inspiration. But, according to a new interview with Def Jam CEO Steve Bartels, Kanye may actually be working on the new project in Utah. He's somewhere out west, it appears, but no one seems to know exactly where.\n\nHere is the interaction between Variety and Bartels.\n\nVariety: Let me ask what\u2019s up with several of your artists. Word was that Kanye West was recording by himself somewhere in Utah\u2014is that real?\n\nBartels: I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s real or not, I read the same things you do. When we talk we don\u2019t really get down to the granular of where he\u2019s going and how he\u2019s flying there, we keep it much more on a broader level. Kanye is working, that\u2019s been widely reported. He\u2019s always very focused, and our relationship with him is that we always have great respect for him and when he\u2019s ready to do something or talk about something, we\u2019re there for him, we totally support his vision and his focus, and that\u2019s where we leave it. I check in with him from time to time just to see how he\u2019s doing. What\u2019s great about our relationship is that I always know when it\u2019s go time\u2014because he wakes me up. [Laughter]\n\nBartels did confirm Kanye is working on new music. He was not totally sure of the timeline for the release, however.\n\n\u201cYou never know,\u201d Bartels said, when asked if the new music would arrive this year. \u201cHe\u2019s always working, so maybe so. It\u2019s never something we\u2019re pushing\u2014it\u2019s always led by the creative side.\u201d\n\nProbably a good approach from Bartels\u2014let Kanye do his thing, and when the project\u2019s done, he\u2019ll let you know. He'll give you a call at 3 a.m.\n\nBartels also spoke on another Def Jam artist, Justin Bieber, who is quietly killing it right now.\n\n\u201cThe remarkable thing about him right now is that he could be having the song of the summer without it being his own record\u2014both the DJ Khaled [\u2018I\u2019m the One\u2019] and Luis Fonsi [\u2018Despacito\u2019] records are massive right now, and we\u2019ve got another one coming,\u201d Bartels said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a new release on Friday with Bieber and David Guetta called \u20182U.\u2019 We\u2019ll be working on in conjunction with Warner France\u2014we\u2019ll be taking care of it here. It\u2019s a massive record, and it\u2019s another song that\u2019s gonna compete for song of the summer even though it\u2019s starting later than the other two.\u201d\n\nBartels has spent 30 years in the music business (he started as a DJ, and he\u2019s been the Def Jam CEO since 2014), so he knows what he\u2019s doing and how to handle artists. He also spoke on Bieber growing up in the spotlight, Iggy Azalea\u2019s new music, and whether the upcoming releases from Vince Staples and 2 Chainz will step on each other.\n\nYou can read the full interview here.", "images": ["https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,c_fill,ar_1.55,w_2048,g_auto/v1723869076/sanity-new/kanye-kim-nyc-133415568.jpg", "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723869078/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-1482-1670495206-133_16x9-6504051"], "top_img": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723869078/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-1482-1670495206-133_16x9-6504051", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aaron C.
