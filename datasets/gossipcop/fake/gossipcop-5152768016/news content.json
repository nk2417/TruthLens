Twilight first hit theaters in Nov. of 2008, turning Robert Pattinson, 31, and Kristen Stewart, 27, into international superstars with both their film franchise and their epic off-screen romance. While they\u2019re no longer a couple, the actors think that with the 10 year anniversary upon us the time is right for a reboot. \u201cRob and Kristen would love to see Twilight come back or be rebooted, but they would love to see a TV show come out of it most. And they would be totally down to be a part of it, but would only like to make an appearance over being fully cast in the project,\u201d a source close to the stars tells HollywoodLife.com EXClUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cThey realize what the franchise did for their careers and would be happy to support it for a new generation to enjoy. They hope something gets off the ground,\u201d our insider adds. Relations between Robert and Kristen seemed to have thawed after some frosty years since the franchise \u2014 as well as their romance \u2014 ended. The two were spotted by eyewitnesses grabbing a drink at LA\u2019s Edendale bar on Feb. 11, bringing hope to Twihards everywhere that something new might be on the horizon. While a romance isn\u2019t in the works as K-Stew is still happily dating 27-year-old model Stella Maxwell, a professional reunion would certainly be welcome!\n\nRobert himself hinted that he might be down for more Twilight, as an exec at the film\u2019s studio Lionsgate said last fall that \u201cthere are a lot more stories to be told\u201d in the series, as long as author Stephenie Meyer was on board. In an interview with the Huffington Post Rob teased, \u201cWell, you never know,\u201d when it came to taking part in any new Twilight related projects. \u201cIt did inspire me at the time,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cAnd, really, it\u2019s kind of awesome.\u201d Hell yes it is!\n\nHollywoodLifers, would you like to see a reboot of Twilight? Who would you cast as Edward and Bella today?", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/kristen-stewart-robert-pattinson-reuniting-ftr.jpg?fit=330%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-over-and-done-bonnie-says-ftr.jpg?fit=330%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-would-love-to-see-a-e28098twilight_-reboot-after-10th-anniversary-ftr.jpg?resize=384%2C216", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-talking-bonnie-says-ftr.jpg?fit=351%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-would-love-to-see-a-e28098twilight_-reboot-after-10th-anniversary-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C350"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-would-love-to-see-a-e28098twilight_-reboot-after-10th-anniversary-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C350", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/02/26/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-twilight-reboot-film-anniversary/", "title": "Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart Would \u2018Love\u2019 To See A \u2018Twilight\u2019 Reboot After 10th Anniversary", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Robert Pattinson &amp; Kristen Stewart would be thrilled to see 'Twilight' get a reboot, now that the film is having it's 10 year anniversary.", "google-site-verification": "Atm19DlLsEdntyQvdD3b8sMiONm67k-Es2Ds9GrBCvU", "news_keywords": "Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Twilight", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "amp-consent-blocking": "amp-ad,amp-iframe", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.7", "auto-social": "always", "author": "Beth Shilliday", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart Would \u2018Love\u2019 To See A \u2018Twilight\u2019 Reboot After 10th Anniversary", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/02/26/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-twilight-reboot-film-anniversary/", "description": "\u2018Twilight\u2019 turns 10 in 2018 and we\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on if the film\u2019s stars Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart would reboot their iconic vampire romance.", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-would-love-to-see-a-e28098twilight_-reboot-after-10th-anniversary-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C350", "width": 620, "height": 350}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-27T04:45:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-28T16:33:14+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart Would \u2018Love\u2019 To See A \u2018Twilight\u2019 Reboot After 10th Anniversary", "description": "Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart would be thrilled to see 'Twilight' get a reboot, now that the film is having it's 10 year anniversary.", "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-would-love-to-see-a-e28098twilight_-reboot-after-10th-anniversary-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C350"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cropped-hlicon_COLOR.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519621200.0, "source": "http://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
