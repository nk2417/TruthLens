That\u2019s the alarming claim being made in a recent article in The National Inquirer . According to the Enquirer , Brad has been living the \u201chippy\u201d lifestyle, refusing to take showers and change his clothes as he continues to get over his divorce from Angelina Jolie and the separation from his children. He has also allegedly been sleeping on friends\u2019 couches because he\u2019s afraid that if he remains home alone, he will relapse into addiction.\n\nBut Gossip Cop , a site that\u2019s become known for debunking celebrity rumors has said the report smells just as fishy as they claim Brad Pitt smells.\n\n\u201cBrad\u2019s gone days, if not weeks, at a time without taking a shower, so of course he stinks of body odor a lot of the time,\u201d an alleged close friend of the War Machine actor reportedly told The National Enquirer , as reported by Gossip Cop .\n\nBut Gossip Cop has a different story that they claim they received from someone who is actually in Pitt\u2019s inner circle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re told Pitt isn\u2019t living the lifestyle of a smelly drifter, and the claim otherwise is completely bogus,\u201d Gossip Cop states.\n\nThe latest report in the ongoing Brad Pitt Angelina Jolie saga is that Brad Pitt was \u201callowed\u201d to see his children to celebrate Father\u2019s Day.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/gqstylemag/status/875785954438430720\n\nPeople Magazine reported that the children of the Jolie-Pitt clan reunited with their father on Saturday. According to People , they were dropped off at Brad\u2019s Los Angeles home where they spent the morning with him before leaving with their mother for a trip to France later that day.\n\nWe highly doubt that Brad would have not showered before spending time with his kids especially since it was a special occasion.\n\nBrad Pitt Assures Everyone \u201cHe\u2019s Got Nothing to Hide\u201d After Truth-Telling GQ Interview \u2013 https://t.co/lGUMKAgM9Z pic.twitter.com/5JC7p5CSzI \u2014 TheCelebrityTalk (@TheCelebrityTlk) May 16, 2017\n\nBrad Pitt has previously discussed how he\u2019s currently coping with the divorce.
