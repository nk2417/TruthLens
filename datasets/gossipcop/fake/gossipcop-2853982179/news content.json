Thank you all for your prayers!!!! We love & appreciate ya #Harts \u2014 Kevin Hart (@KevinHart4real) November 21, 2017\n\nThe couple announced on Mother's Day that they were expecting their first child together. The two married in August 2016. Hart has two children from a previous marriage.\n\nHart and his wife experienced a false alarm earlier this month when the comedian canceled a radio interview because he thought his wife was in labor.\n\n\"No labor yet guys....false alarm,\" Hart tweeted shortly after to his fans. \"We are getting close tho. Waiting patiently for the arrival of our little man!!! #Harts.\"\n\nIn September, Hart made a vague public apology to his wife and children in which he said he made \"bad error in judgment\" after he allegedly fell victim to extortion.\n\n\"It's a s**tty moment when you know you're wrong and there's no excuses for your wrong behavior,\" he said in an Instagram video. \"At the end of the day, I just simply got to do better. But I'm also not gonna allow a person to have financial gain off my mistakes. In this particular situation, that's what was attempted. I said I'd rather fess up to my mistakes.\"\n\nAttorney Lisa Bloom said a woman had a brief affair with Hart in August and someone illegally recorded intimate footage of the two of them. Bloom said the woman \"is adamant that she had nothing to do with this and that she is a crime victim just like Kevin Hart.\"", "images":
