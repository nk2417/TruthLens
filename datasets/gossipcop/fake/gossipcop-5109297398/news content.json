Impact Link\n\nTaylor Swift will reportedly keep her upcoming album, \"Reputation,\" off of streaming services during its first week of sales.\n\nSwift kept her last album, \"1989,\" off of Spotify for several years after removing her entire catalog from the service in late 2014.\n\n\"Reputation\" will be available in retail outlets and online stores on November 10.\n\nRepresentatives for Taylor Swift have told streaming services that the pop star's upcoming album, \"Reputation,\" will be kept off streaming during its first week of sales, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg's Lucas Shaw.\n\nBloomberg's sources said that the streaming services are still negotiating with Swift to determine when \"Reputation\" will be available.\n\nSwift has had a back-and-forth relationship with streaming services in recent years.\n\nThe singer kept her last album, \"1989,\" off of Spotify upon its release in 2014, when she removed her entire back catalog from the service.\n\nIn July 2014, months prior to the album's release, Swift wrote an op-ed condemning Spotify's free tier in the Wall Street Journal, writing, \"It's my opinion that music should not be free.\"\n\nSwift allowed \"1989\" to stream on Apple Music, which does not offer a free tier, upon that service's launch in January 2015.\n\nShe eventually made her back catalog and \"1989\" available to stream on Spotify in June, after \"1989\" had sold over 10 million copies.\n\n\"Reputation\" will be available for sale in retail outlets and online stores like the iTunes on November 10.", "images":
