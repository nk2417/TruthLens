We had a laugh about it. So many rumours have been spread over the years and you have to learn, especially in this business, to just laugh it off. If you stress about it, you\u2019ll drive yourself crazy.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe speculation over the Black Eyed Peas singer's face grew so feverish after her March performance that her husband, Josh Duhamel, spoke out in her defense.\n\n\"I thought she looked amazing,\" he told Ryan Seacrest. \"It's amazing. You put a different color on your lips and, uh, rumors fly. But she's the same, she's the same Fergie... I sleep right next to her every night. I like it.\"\n\nFergie, who has previously admitted she controls her weight by telling herself food is poison, told Cosmo UK a more sensible story about her diet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFor me, healthy eating and exercising is something I work on constantly,\" she said. \"I\u2019m not the most disciplined dieter. I try to eat a lot of fruit and vegetables but sometimes late at night I tend to have fast-food meals \u2013 and that\u2019s where I get myself into trouble! So I\u2019m not in the best shape I could be, but I\u2019m still healthy and comfy. You know, I\u2019m a curvy woman and I just want to be comfortable with that.\u201d\n\nRead more about Fergie, including her plans to start a family and her relationship with husband Josh Duhamel, in the September issue of Cosmopolitan UK, on sale August 8.\n\nSee photos of celebrities who have admitted to getting plastic surgery:\n\nCelebrate Truth This Season Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission The holidays can get loud.
