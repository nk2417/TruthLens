She later established a solo career with her debut album Dangerously in Love, becoming one of music\u2019s top-selling artists with sold-out tours and a slew of awards. Beyonc\u00e9 has also starred in several movies, including Dream Girls. She married hip-hop recording artist Jay-Z in 2008, and the couple has three children. She also holds the record for most Grammy wins in history with 35.\n\nKeep Reading How to Buy Beyonc\u00e9 Tickets for Cowboy Carter\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles-Carter\n\nBORN: September 4, 1981\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Houston, Texas\n\nSPOUSE: Jay-Z (2008\u2013present)\n\nCHILDREN: Blue Ivy, Rumi, and Sir\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Virgo\n\nWhere Is Beyonc\u00e9 From?\n\nBorn Beyonc\u00e9 Giselle Knowles on September 4, 1981, Beyonc\u00e9 is from Houston. Her earliest years were spent in the Texas city\u2019s Third Ward. The Knowles family lived on Rosedale Street in the MacGregor Way neighborhood then Parkwood Drive in nearby Riverside Terrace. In 2000, they moved to a gated community in Missouri City, a southwest suburb of Houston. Beyonc\u00e9 lived in the Houston area until she was 21.\n\nFamily: Parents and Sister\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s parents are Tina Knowles, a fashion designer, and Mathew Knowles, an entertainment executive who managed Beyonc\u00e9 for more than a decade. Tina and Mathew got married the year before they had Beyonc\u00e9, who is named after her mother\u2019s maiden name. The couple welcomed Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s sister, Solange, in 1986.\n\nFor many years, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s mother worked as a hairstylist and ran her own salon called Headliners. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s father was a successful Xerox sales executive. Tina and Mathew both had modest childhoods in Galveston, Texas, and Alabama, respectively, but their prosperous careers provided a comfortable lifestyle for their daughters. Their work ethics didn\u2019t go unnoticed by young Beyonc\u00e9.\n\n\u201cMy parents taught me how to work hard and smart. Both were entrepreneurs; I watched them struggle working 18-hour days,\u201d she told Elle in 2016. \u201cThey taught me that nothing worth having comes easily. My father stressed discipline and was tough with me. He pushed me to be a leader and an independent thinker. My mother loved me unconditionally, so I felt safe enough to dream.\u201d\n\nGetty Images Mathew and Tina Knowles helped Beyonc\u00e9 find her passion for performing by enrolling their daughter in dance class when she was young.\n\nAs Beyonc\u00e9 was chasing her dream of having a music career with Destiny\u2019s Child, her parents supported her every step of the way. \u201cIt never mattered to me if my kids did music,\u201d Mathew said in a 2004 Rolling Stone article. \u201cIf Beyonc\u00e9 came to me and said, \u2018Dad, I wanna be a doctor,\u2019 I would find a way of buying a hospital.\u201d Mathew didn\u2019t need to take that drastic step but opted for another one: quitting his corporate job to become his daughter\u2019s manager. He even took a music business class at Houston Community College. The gamble paid off.\n\nWhen Destiny\u2019s Child began finding traction, Tina acted as the group\u2019s stylist and eventually costume designer. , and Tina had learned the tricks of the trade in her youth, making outfits for a singing group she was in as a high schooler. Tina continues to work in fashion design today.\n\nMathew was Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s manager during her Destiny\u2019s Child tenure and through the first years of her solo career. However, in March 2011, the father and daughter announced they would no longer work together. \u201cWe both knew it was time, maybe a few years before, but I love my father so much, and he has taught me so many things. So [choosing to part ways] was something that was hard,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 later told Oprah Winfrey. \u201cI had to tell myself, \u2018At some point, you have to be the adult that your father has raised.\u2019\u201d At the time, Mathew said, \u201cBusiness is business and family is family. I love my daughter and am very proud of who she is and all that she has achieved.\u201d They continue to be a part of each other\u2019s personal lives, including during Mathew\u2019s breast cancer diagnosis and successful treatment in 2019.\n\nAnother major split in the Knowles family became official in 2011. That year, Mathew and Tina finalized their divorce after separating two years prior. Both of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s parents have since remarried. Mathew wed Gena Avery in 2013. Two years later, Tina married actor Richard Lawson, whom she had known for many years. However, in July 2023, Tina filed for a divorce, citing irreconcilable differences, that was finalized the following August.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 isn\u2019t the only star in her family of origin. Her sister, Solange, is a Grammy-winning singer in her own right. She began her career as a backup dancer and occasional singer for Destiny\u2019s Child. In 2016, Solange and Beyonc\u00e9 became the first sisters to have chart-topping albums on the Billboard 200 in the same year.\n\nChildhood\n\nGetty Images Beyonc\u00e9 and her younger sister, Solange, had commonplace childhoods before becoming famous Grammy-winning singers.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 had a commonplace childhood before finding fame as a teen. She was raised in a religious household and attended Sunday service at St. John\u2019s Downtown Church, a United Methodist church in Houston. She spent her free time seeing movies, visiting AstroWorld amusement park, and going to the Houston rodeo annually.\n\nBecause she was a shy child, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s parents enrolled her in a dance class, hoping it\u2019d help her make friends. Performing unlocked an unexpected confidence in the future star. By the time she won her school\u2019s talent show as a first grader with a rendition of John Lennon\u2019s \u201cImagine,\u201d her fate was sealed. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, Lord, this is amazing,\u2019\u201d she told Rolling Stone. \u201cSo I knew I wanted to be a singer. I think I knew before that, but I\u2019d never been on a stage before that.\u201d\n\nShe started performing regularly and won 35 local talent shows in a row. At age 9, she began taking voice lessons from an opera singer. Next came an endurance exercise orchestrated by her father: 10-year-old Beyonc\u00e9 ran 1 mile in the morning while singing so she\u2019d be able to sing and dance simultaneously.\n\n\u201cI have very, very early-on memories of her rehearsing on her own in her room,\u201d her sister, Solange, told . \u201cI specifically remember her taking a line out of a song or a routine and just doing it over and over and over again until it was perfect and it was strong. At age 10, when everybody else was ready to say, \u2018Okay, I\u2019m tired, let\u2019s take a break,\u2019 she wanted to continue\u2014to ace it and overcome it.\u201d\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 credits her mother for helping her maintain a sense of normalcy. \u201cShe always kept me a normal kid; she made sure I had slumber parties, made sure we hung out with our friends\u2014even after eighth grade, when we started being home-schooled,\u201d Beyonce said in 2005. Before that, Beyonc\u00e9 attended St. Mary, a private Catholic school; Parker Elementary School; and Welch Middle School. She was also a student at High School for the Performing and Visual Arts.\n\nAlong with Solange, Beyonc\u00e9 grew up alongside her cousin Angie and friend Kelly Rowland. Both lived with the Knowles family for a time. Rowland was also a talented singer, and soon, she and Beyonc\u00e9 began performing together in the girl group that became Destiny\u2019s Child.\n\nDestiny\u2019s Child\n\nGetty Images Kelly Rowland, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and Michelle Williams performing at Super Bowl XLVII in February 2013.\n\nIn the early 1990s, 9-year-old Beyonc\u00e9 and Kelly Rowland formed a singing group with some classmates. Girls Tyme found early traction by booking an appearance on the TV talent competition show Star Search in 1992. The group impressed the judges but not enough to win. The loss propelled Mathew Knowles, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s father, to leave his corporate job to become the group\u2019s full-time manager. The group went through some name and line-up changes before landing a record deal in 1997 with Columbia Records as Destiny\u2019s Child. Joining Beyonc\u00e9 and Rowland to round out the group were LeToya Luckett and Latavia Roberson.\n\nDestiny\u2019s Child soon became one of the most popular R&B acts with the release of its first, self-titled album in February 1998 and its biggest hit \u201cNo, No, No.\u201d Gaining momentum, the group scored its first Grammy nomination and No. 1 single on the Billboard Hot 100 with \u201cBills, Bills, Bills\u201d from their second album, The Writing\u2019s On The Wall (1999). The record, on which Beyonc\u00e9 began to flex her songwriting muscle, featured a second chart-topper, the Grammy-winning \u201cSay My Name,\u201d and another hit in \u201cJumpin\u2019 Jumpin.\u2019\u201d Within two months of its release, The Writing\u2019s On The Wall was certified platinum, and it has now sold more than 8 million copies.\n\nDespite emerging as mainstream stars, Destiny\u2019s Child experienced some internal turmoil with the departure of Luckett and Roberson in December 1999. The women, who say they were kicked out, later sued and settled out of court. Farrah Franklin briefly joined the group, but ultimately, the lineup solidified with Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, and Michelle Williams. As a trio, Destiny\u2019s Child soon reached new heights.\n\nSurvivor (2001), the group\u2019s third album, debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and produced two more smash hits. \u201cIndependent Women Part I\u201d led Billboard\u2019s mainstream songs chart for 11 weeks, and \u201cBootylicious\u201d spent two weeks at No. 1. The latter song held special meaning for Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cI was feeling a bit insecure from hearing some of the comments [about my weight], and I woke up one day and refused to feel sorry for myself, so I wrote \u2018Bootylicious,\u2019\u201d she recalled to Harper\u2019s Bazaar . \u201cIt was the beginning of me using whatever life handed me and turning it into something empowering to other women and men who were struggling with the same thing.\u201d Survivor\u2019s title track won the Grammy for Best R&B Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal, marking the group\u2019s third trophy.\n\nDuring the three-year hiatus that followed the release of a 2001 Christmas album, the trio each worked on independent projects. For Beyonc\u00e9, this included her acting debut and her first solo album. Destiny\u2019s Child returned in 2004 with Destiny Fulfilled, which featured the hit songs \u201cLose My Breath,\u201d \u201cSoldier\u201d with T.I. and Lil Wayne , and \u201cCater 2 U.\u201d Yet, their days were numbered.\n\nIn June 2005, the group announced they would disband after the final concert on their Destiny Fulfilled\u2026 and Lovin\u2019 It tour that September. \u200b\u200b\u201cAfter a lot of discussion and some deep soul-searching, we realized that our current tour has given us the opportunity to leave Destiny\u2019s Child on a high note, united in our friendship and filled with an overwhelming gratitude for our music, our fans, and each other,\u201d they shared in a statement. \u201cAfter all these wonderful years working together, we realized that now is the time to pursue our personal goals and solo efforts in earnest.\u201d\n\nAll of Destiny\u2019s Child\u2019s albums are platinum- or multiplatinum-certified, having sold 1 million copies or more. After The Chicks and TLC, Destiny\u2019s Child has sold more albums in the United States than any other female musical group in history. Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, and Williams gave a surprise performance for a brief Destiny\u2019s Child reunion during the 2013 Super Bowl halftime show. \u201cKelly and Michelle are still my best friends,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 told Harper\u2019s Bazaar in 2021.\n\nSolo Albums\n\nAs a solo artist, Beyonc\u00e9 has released eight studio albums to enormous commercial and critical success. All eight debuted as No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 and have sold the equivalent of 37 million copies combined. Five records have won Grammy Awards as the Best Contemporary R&B Album, Best Urban Contemporary Album, or Best Dance/Electronic Music Album. I Am\u2026 Sasha Fierce was the singer\u2019s first Album of the Year nominee, but that trophy proved elusive despite four more nods in the category (including as a contributor to Lady Gaga\u2019s 2009 album The Fame Monster). Finally, Beyonc\u00e9 won Album of the Year for Cowboy Carter in 2025.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s latest album, Cowboy Carter, released on March 29, 2024. Her albums, in order, are:\n\nDangerously In Love (2003) Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s solo debut sounded much like her days as part of Destiny\u2019s Child. Many songs, such as \u201cCrazy In Love\u201d and \u201cMe, Myself and I,\u201d touched on romance and relationships. The record resulted in five Grammy Awards, including Best Contemporary R&B Album. Dangerously In Love remains one of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s best-selling albums; the multiplatinum-certified project has sold the equivalent of 7 million copies. B\u2019Day (2006) Anchored by \u201cIrrepplaceable\u201d and \u201cDeva Vu,\u201d B\u2019Day mimicked much of the success of Dangerously In Love. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s sophomore album garnered four Grammy nominations and won Best Contemporary R&B Album. I Am\u2026 Sasha Fierce (2008) Beyonc\u00e9 put her alter ego, Sasha Fierce, on full display with her 2008 record. The double-album incorporated emotional ballads like \u201cIf I Were a Boy\u201d and \u201cHalo\u201d as well as catchy female-empowerment tunes such as \u201cSingle Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\u201d and \u201cDiva.\u201d At the 2010 Grammy Awards, the singer collected her third consecutive Contemporary R&B Album trophy. 4 (2011) The singer\u2019s fourth album was aptly titled 4. A largely upbeat collection, 4 was Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first album to lead the Billboard 200 for multiple weeks (in this case, two weeks). Its bigger hits included the Grammy-winning \u201cLove On Top\u201d and \u201cRun the World (Girls).\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 (2013) On December 13, 2013, the triple-threat delivered a self-titled, surprise album and music videos to accompany all 14 tracks. Beyonc\u00e9 was released exclusively on iTunes initially before CD sales began one week later. The record-breaking album became the fastest-selling collection ever distributed by iTunes, having sold more than 80,000 copies in three hours, and sold more than 800,000 physical copies throughout that first weekend alone. \u201cDrunk In Love,\u201d a sensual track featuring husband Jay-Z, became a Grammy-winning standout song followed by the equally suggestive \u201cPartition\u201d and feminist anthem \u201c***Flawless\u201d featuring author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s three weeks atop the Billboard 200 marked a personal best for the singer that still stands. Lemonade (2016) In April 2016, the groundbreaking artist dropped an hour-long conceptual film on HBO that incorporated tracks from her sixth album, Lemonade, which was released immediately afterward. The cable special showcased the singer reeling from the romantic betrayal of her partner while acknowledging the strength found in communities of Black women. Tennis star Serena Williams and young actor Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis also made appearances in the New Orleans\u2013based project, which was helmed by a variety of directors and featured poetry from Warsan Shire. Lemonade the album was only initially available via Tidal, the online streaming service backed by Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s husband, Jay-Z, before its wider release. Musical contributors to the project included Jack White, The Weeknd, James Blake, and Kendrick Lamar. Lemonade debuted at No. 1, making Beyonc\u00e9 the only artist in history to have all of her first six studio albums reach the top of Billboard\u2019s albums chart. The acclaimed work won two Grammys\u2014Best Urban Contemporary Album and Best Music Video for \u201cFormation\u201d\u2014but lost Album of the Year in a much-remembered snub. Renaissance (2022) After a six-year break, during which time the COVID-19 pandemic began, Beyonc\u00e9 returned with act I of a three-part project: Renaissance. Infused in her signature anthems and powerhouse vocals were sounds and beats from the dance music scene. \u201cCreating this album allowed me a place to dream and to find escape during a scary time for the world,\u201d the artist shared on Instagram. \u201cIt allowed me to feel free and adventurous in a time when little else was moving.\u201d The lead single \u201cBreak My Soul\u201d teased to the full album release in July 2022 and became her seventh No. 1 song. \u201cCuff It\u201d was another popular hit among fans and critics. Renaissance resulted in four out of eight possible Grammy trophies, including for both aforementioned songs and Best Dance/Electronic Music Album. Cowboy Carter (2024) Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s most recent record is Cowboy Carter. As the name implies, the singer embraced country music and collaborated with some of the genre\u2019s biggest names like Willie Nelson, Dolly Parton, and Linda Martell. Beyonc\u00e9 combined original songs like the No. 1 hit \u201cTexas Hold \u2019Em\u201d with covers such as The Beatles\u2019 \u201cBlackbird\u201d and Parton\u2019s \u201cJolene.\u201d Cowboy Carter resulted in 11 Grammy nominations and won three of those, including Album of the Year and Best Country Album.\n\nHow Many Grammys Does Beyonc\u00e9 Have?\n\nThe most decorated and most nominated artist in Grammy history, Beyonc\u00e9 has won 35 Grammys out of 99 career nominations. Among her trophies are Album of the Year for Cowboy Carter, Song of the Year for her smash hit \u201cSingle Ladies (Put A Ring On It),\u201d and five awards for Best R&B Song.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s first three Grammys came during her tenure with Destiny\u2019s Child. The trio earned back-to-back trophies for Best R&B Performance By A Duo or Group With Vocals for \u201cSay My Name\u201d and \u201cSurvivor\u201d in 2001 and 2002. \u201cSay My Name\u201d was also named Best R&B Song.\n\nThat award has proven to be the most fruitful for the singer, who has won Best R&B Song more times than any other Grammy category in her career. Since \u201cSay My Name,\u201d she collected the trophy for \u201cCrazy In Love,\u201d \u201cSingle Ladies (Put A Ring On It),\u201d \u201cDrunk In Love,\u201d and \u201cCuff It.\u201d\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 again won Best R&B Performance By A Duo or Group With Vocals for the duets \u201cThe Closer I Get To You\u201d with Luther Vandross and \u201cSo Amazing\u201d with Stevie Wonder. Elsewhere, Beyonc\u00e9 has three Contemporary R&B Album awards for Dangerously In Love, B\u2019Day, and I Am\u2026 Sasha Fierce. She also has twice won the Grammy for Urban Contemporary Album with Lemonade and Everything Is Love, her joint album with husband Jay-Z.\n\nThe 52nd Grammy Awards in January 2010 were a monumental success for Beyonc\u00e9. She took home six trophies that night, setting the record for most Grammy wins by a female artist in a single ceremony. (Adele matched the record in 2012.) Moreover, the singer saw a career milestone when she accepted Song of the Year for \u201cSingle Ladies (Put A Ring On It).\u201d The award is one of the most coveted at the annual ceremony.\n\nMore than a decade later, in 2023, the singer made history when she became the top Grammy Award winner of all time. Her four trophies that night broke her tie, at 28, with producer Quincy Jones and allowed her to leapfrog conductor Georg Solti, who won 31 Grammys. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to be too emotional. I\u2019m trying to just receive this night,\u201d she said during her acceptance speech for her record-breaking win. \u201cThank you so much to the Grammys.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 99 Grammy nominations are also the most in history.\n\nDespite her records, detractors long criticized the Recording Academy for the fact that Beyonc\u00e9 has been largely shut out of the top Grammy categories. The singer has received six nods for Album of the Year and multiple others for Song and Record of the Year with just one trophies to show for it. Pointing to her lack of Album titles, in particular, critics cited this as an example of the industry\u2019s bias against Black artists. Even Jay-Z joined the fray when accepting the Dr. Dre Global Impact Award at the 2024 ceremony. \u201cI don\u2019t want to embarrass this young lady, but she has more Grammys than everyone and never won Album of the Year,\u201d he said referring to Beyonc\u00e9. But that changed in 2025 when Cowboy Carter won Album of the Year.\n\nMarriage to Jay-Z\n\nIn 2008, Beyonc\u00e9 married rapper and music mogul Jay-Z in a small, private ceremony in New York City. Among the guests sighted at the wedding were Knowles\u2019 mother, Tina Knowles; father, Mathew; sister, Solange; Destiny\u2019s Child members Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams; and friend Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nPhoto: Lester Cohen/Getty Images for NARAS Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles and Jay-Z at the 2017 Grammy Awards\n\nIn June 2018, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z embarked on the European leg of their 48-date tour. While they lived up to expectations with their theatrics and swagger, the couple also surprised fans with the release of their joint album, Everything Is Love, following a London show on June 16. Initially available for streaming only on the Jay-Z-owned Tidal, the nine-track album was accompanied by a video for the track \u201cApesh\u2013\u2013,\u201d which featured the couple and their dancers gallivanting around some of the world\u2019s most famous artworks at the Louvre in Paris.\n\nChildren\n\nFollowing years of pregnancy rumors, Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z went public with the news of their impending new arrival in 2011, the mom-to-be showing off her growing baby bump at the MTV Video Music Awards that August.\n\nShe and Jay-Z welcomed a baby daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, in early January 2012. The couple spared no expense to maintain their privacy during this special time, renting out a floor of New York\u2019s Lenox Hill Hospital.\n\nIn February 2017, the \u201cIrreplaceable\u201d singer announced on Instagram that she and Jay-Z were expecting twins. Later, the iconic shot was revealed to be the year\u2019s most-liked Instagram post, with 11.1 million fans offering their approval.\n\nThey welcomed twins, a boy and a girl, in June 2017. Although the couple didn\u2019t immediately confirm the twins\u2019 birth or their names, People magazine reported that they had filed trademark documents at the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the names Sir and Rumi. In the early morning hours of July 14, Knowles made it official, posting a photo in which she\u2019s holding her one-month-old twins.\n\nQuotes\n\nWhenever I\u2019m out in public, I have to be put together. When I get home, I rebel against it, and I don\u2019t want to take care of anything. I drop it. I\u2019m relaxed. I don\u2019t have any shoes on. No makeup.\n\nI feel that, especially now, with the internet and paparazzi and camera phones, it\u2019s so difficult to maintain mystery.\n\nOne of the reasons I connect to the Super Bowl is that I approach my shows like an athlete.\n\nI think people have an idea in their heads about entertainers [and] celebrities. I think they feel like their lives are so perfect, and it\u2019s really hard to go through painful experiences when you are in the public eye because it\u2019s hard to have closure.\n\nThe best thing is looking back and realizing how good life is. If you don\u2019t take the time to think about it, analyze it, you\u2019ll never realize all the dots that are connected.\n\nWe\u2019re all going through our problems, but we all have the same insecurities and we all have the same abilities, and we all need each other.\n\nIn my hardest moments, where I thought, \u201cWhat am I doing? I\u2019m not strong enough for this, I can\u2019t get through this, I\u2019m not ready.\u201d I just have to say, \u201cJump!\u201d because I know I\u2019m gonna land in that water and swim back on the boat, and I\u2019m going to jump again and land in the water and swim back to the boat. I have to trust myself.\n\nMy life is a journey. It seems like I set a goal and, some kind of way, I accomplish it, and then I set another one. And my goal was trusting myself, and my goal was growth.\n\nWomen have to work much harder to make it in this world. It really pisses me off that women don\u2019t get the same opportunities as men do. Because, let\u2019s face it, money gives men the power to run the show. It gives men the power to define our values and to define what\u2019s sexy and what\u2019s feminine and that\u2019s bullsh\u2013t. At the end of the day, it\u2019s not about equal rights, it\u2019s about how we think. We have to reshape our own perception of how we view ourselves.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to release my music the way I\u2019ve done it. I am bored with that. I feel like I am able to speak directly to my fans. There\u2019s so much that gets between the music, the artist and the fans. I felt like I didn\u2019t want anybody to give the message when my record is coming out. I just want this to come out when it\u2019s ready and from me to my fans.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult being a woman. It\u2019s so much pressure, and we need that support sometimes.\n\nFact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
