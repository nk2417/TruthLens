There went a great one. There\u2019s nobody like Harry Dean. Everyone loved him. And with good reason. He was a great actor (actually beyond great) \u2013 and a great human being \u2013 so great to be around him!!! You are really going to be missed Harry Dean!!! Loads of love to you wherever you are now!!!\u201c\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nDirector Monte Hellman made \u201cRide in the Whirlwind\u201d (1966), \u201cTwo Lane Blacktop\u201d (1971), and \u201cCockfighter\u201d (1974) with Stanton. He told Variety that he met Stanton through Jack Nicholson \u201cback when they were roommates.\u201d Hellman said that Stanton \u201chad the same quality as all great actors and I think Harry summed it up best himself when he told me some advice Jack had given him. It was \u2018Let the wardrobe do the acting.\u2019 He was one of a kind and he didn\u2019t have a bad angle. You could him up, down, left, right and he always looked great. He did have an actor\u2019s ego and did want to garner more lead roles. I remember on \u2018Two Lane Blacktop\u2019 he thought he should have been cast in the Warren Oates part. He was also very upset when he discovered, on location in Oklahoma, that the character was a gay hitchhiker. This was 1970 and he was a little bit old-fashioned in his thinking then. Actually, he was so pissed off, he almost quit. But then he delivered what I believe is one of the most moving performances of his life.\u201d\n\nShawn Doyle, who acted with Stanton in \u201cBig Love,\u201d tweeted a tribute. \u201cYou could watch him on set say a line as simple as \u2018hello,\u2019 and be mystified why it was so friggin compelling.\u201d\n\nYou could watch him on set say a line as simple as \"hello\", and be mystified by why it was so friggin compelling. #RIPHarryDeanStanton \u2014 Shawn Doyle (@Shawndoyle) September 15, 2017\n\nHorror film director John Carpenter, who directed the actor in \u201cEscape From New York,\u201d tweeted, \u201cHarry Dean Stanton was a wonderful man, kind and full of humor. He was also a great actor. Goodbye, Harry Dean. Rest in peace.\u201d\n\nHarry Dean Stanton was a wonderful man, kind and full of humor. He was also a great actor. Goodbye, Harry Dean.
