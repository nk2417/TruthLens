Cooper told the CinemaCon crowd that always wanted to do a love story and the best way to express that is through music.\n\nCooper REX/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cWe jumped on stage in front of real crowds,\u201d said Cooper.\n\nIn the new movie, Cooper plays Jackson Maine, a country music star on the brink of decline when he discovers a talented unknown named Ally (Gaga). As the two begin a passionate love affair, Jack coaxes Ally into the spotlight, catapulting her to stardom. But as Ally\u2019s career quickly eclipses his own, Jack finds it increasingly hard to handle his fading glory.\n\nIt\u2019s a poignant, honest trailer about songwriters and singers, and their struggles. Cooper croons country, and Gaga\u2019s mellifluous voice kicks in three-quarters into the trailer with a big \u201cAaahhh.\u201d While she wasn\u2019t onstage, Gaga\u2019s voice spoke for her in the trailer. Cooper\u2019s character performs in what looks like a jazz burlesque club. He meets the ingenue at the bar, and sparks ignite as it is clear she has the potential to ascend as quickly as he is descending.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nWarners generally doesn\u2019t release its CinemaCon-premiered footage, but we will post the video when it becomes available.
