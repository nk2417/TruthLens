She has also lost friends in the LGBT community because of her political views [backing Donald Trump].\n\n\"She was really hoping to reconnect with the Kardashians, especially with Khloe and Kim having had babies, but sadly she hasn't met them, and she hasn't even got to spend much time with her new granddaughter Stormi [Kylie Jenner's baby]. She just wants some companionship and really felt all alone before she met Sophia.\"\n\nCaitlyn and Sophia live together and are rarely seen without one another by their sides.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 5 Images Caitlyn and Sophia are said to be planning an intimate ceremony (Image: caitlynjenner/Instagram)\n\nView 5 Images She's said previously she was open to dating men and women (Image: REUTERS)\n\nThey're reportedly planning an intimate ceremony near Caitlyn's home in Malibu.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nHowever, a source close to Caitlyn told Mirror Online that while they could be dating, marriage isn't on the cards just yet.\n\nBack in January, Caitlyn made a number of revelations during her tell-all interview on Piers Morgan's Life Stories.\n\nAnd she said at the time she was open to dating men and women.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nShe said: \"It could be either. I don't know. It is kind of fun so see the world from the girl's side.
