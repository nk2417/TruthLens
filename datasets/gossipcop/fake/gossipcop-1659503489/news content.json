down.\n\nWhile she\u2019s hard at work on her new seventh studio album, the singer said this period of her life is all about family.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just super excited about this time in my life,\u201d Ciara told HarpersBazaar.com \u2014 for which she posed topless in a stunning bump photoshoot.\n\n\u201cLike, oh my gosh, I can see my son running around, and soon it\u2019s going to be
