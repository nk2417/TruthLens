The video shows Trump taking down and punching a man with the cable news channel\u2019s logo superimposed over his face.\n\nTrump accompanied the video with a caption, simply saying, \u201c#FraudNewsNetwork\u201d and \u201c#FNN.\u201d\n\nSunday\u2019s tweet is just the latest in the president\u2019s online crusade against CNN, MSNBC, and other media outlets. Trump has been feuding with \u201cMorning Joe\u201d hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski all week, referring to the pair as \u201clow I.Q. crazy,\u201d \u201cdumb as a rock,\u201d and \u201cpsycho\u201d on multiple occasions.\n\nBut while the president has defended his social media etiquette, celebrities and other prominent figures remain critical.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nJ.K. Rowling and Chelsea Clinton referenced our forefathers in their critiques of the controversial clip.\n\nhttps:// .com/ChelseaClinton/status/881517327195439104\n\n'To persevere in one's duty, and be silent, is the best answer to calumny.'\n\nGeorge Washington https://t.co/nvhYdTBF0P \u2014 J.K.
