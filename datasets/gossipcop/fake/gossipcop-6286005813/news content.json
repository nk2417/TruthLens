{"url": "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyga", "text": "American rapper (born 1989)\n\nMichael Ray Stevenson (born November 19, 1989), known professionally as Tyga ( ; a backronym for Thank You God Always),[3] is an American rapper. After several independent releases, he signed a recording contract with Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment, an imprint of Cash Money Records and Republic Records in 2008. His second album and major label debut, Careless World: Rise of the Last King (2012), peaked at number four on the Billboard 200, received platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and was met with critical praise. It spawned the Billboard Hot 100-top ten single \"Rack City\", as well as the top 40 single \"Faded\" (featuring Lil Wayne). His third album, Hotel California (2013), was met with trailing critical and commercial response, along with his collaborative album with singer Chris Brown, Fan of a Fan: The Album (2015).\n\nDue to disagreements with Young Money, Tyga's fourth album, The Gold Album: 18th Dynasty (2015), was released independently. Executive-produced by his then-common law relative Kanye West, it became his lowest-selling album to that point with estimated sales of 5,000 album equivalent units in its first week.[4] His fifth and sixth albums, BitchImTheShit2 (2017) and Kyoto (2018), were both met with continued stagnation. His May 2018 single, \"Taste\" (featuring Offset), marked a brief period of commercial resurgence; it became his first top 40 single since 2015's \"Ayo\" (with Chris Brown)\u2014peaking at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100\u2014and received diamond certification by the RIAA. It served as lead single and preceded the release of his seventh album, Legendary (2019).[5]\n\nEarly life\n\nMichael Ray Stevenson was born on November 19, 1989, in Compton, California,[6] and raised there until he \"was about 11, 12\", before moving to adjacent Gardena.[7] He was born to Jamaican and Vietnamese parents.[8] His mother, Pasionaye Nicole Nguyen (September 11, 1971 \u2013 January 18, 2025), was born in Vietnam and had the maiden name Nguyen.[9] He grew up listening to Fabolous, Lil Wayne, Cam'ron, and Eminem, among others.[10]\n\nOn December 3, 2012, debate arose concerning Tyga's upbringing. Tyga claimed to have been brought up in the low socioeconomic area of Compton, but in leaked footage from the unaired television show Bustas, he claimed he grew up in a \"well-to-do\" home in the Valley, where his parents drove a Range Rover. He also claimed that he attained his nickname from his mother calling him Tiger Woods.[11] There has been speculation that his claims on the show were satirical and not to be taken seriously. Tyga responded to the video's leak on Twitter: \"When u 14 an ambitious u don't give a fuk about anything. Scripted tv isn't that what we all live for. Hahahaha.\"[12]\n\nCareer\n\n2007\u20132010: No Introduction and mixtapes\n\nI met Tyga, he handed me a mixtape on Melrose. I was out in L.A. shopping. (...) You know, being on the road, I get demos and mixtapes all the time. Me and Matt, the drummer of Gym Class, we had this running joke like, \u201cLet's start the record label called Roadside Records\u201d. The joke was, \u201cYeah give us your demo and we\u2019ll sign you to Roadside Records.\u201d Our motto was \u201cyour demo hits the streets the same night\u201d which means as soon as we get your demo, we throwing them bitches out the bus window. (laughs) For some reason, I didn\u2019t throw Tyga\u2019s out. I kept it and listened to it like, homie got potential and he had a lot of energy. So I took him under my wing. \u2014Travie McCoy on discovering Tyga in a 2021 interview with HotNewHipHop. [ 13 ]\n\nTyga's career began with him releasing a multitude of demo tapes and mixtapes. His 2007 debut mixtape, Young On Probation, garnered the attention of rapper and Gym Class Heroes frontman, Travie McCoy. Seeing talent in the artist, McCoy led him to sign a recording contract with Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz's independent label Decaydence Records.[14] Tyga ended up performing on Fall Out Boy's \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" remix with McCoy and Lil' Wayne at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards.[14] He also performed at gigs with Gym Class Heroes and received mentoring from McCoy.[15][14][16] McCoy stated that he \"had [Tyga] sending me verses every other day. We started doing interviews, and he was like, 'This my big cousin Trav.' So a lot of people had the misunderstanding we were blood-related\".[13]\n\nOn June 10, 2008, Tyga released his debut studio album, No Introduction McCoy's imprint, BatSquad Records.[17][18] It was preceded by the single \"Coconut Juice,\" featuring McCoy, which became his first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. In addition to McCoy, the music video featured appearances by Pete Wentz and Lil' Wayne.[14] The album peaked at number 112 on the Billboard 200 and received mixed reviews. A song from the album, \"Diamond Life\" was used in the video games Need for Speed: Undercover and Madden NFL 2009, as well as in the 2009 film Fighting.\n\nAround this time, Tyga formed the record label G.E.D. Inc. (Grinding every day, Getting every dollar, or Getting educated daily) around the time, the same imprint that helped launch the career of fellow West Coast rapper Schoolboy Q, with whom he has worked with early in his career. Tyga also has a G.E.D. Inc tattoo above his right eyebrow.[19][20]\n\nTyga in 2008\n\nIn late 2008, Tyga signed a new record deal with Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment, which was a subsidiary of Cash Money Records at the time. He appeared on the label's posse cut hit single \"Bedrock\" shortly after his signing. He later released the mixtape Fan of a Fan with singer Chris Brown and producers DJ Ill Will and DJ Rockstar. It featured other artists such as Bow Wow, Lil Wayne, and Kevin McCall featured in several tracks. Four tracks \u2014 \"Holla at Me\", \"G Shit\", \"No Bullshit\" and \"Deuces\" \u2014 were accompanied with music videos. The track \"Deuces\" was released as the lead single for the mixtape and reached number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs; it was also nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 53rd Grammy Awards.[21][22] Tyga told MTV in an interview that the mixtape's production took just short of a week.[23] \"Deuces\" was eventually included on Brown's fourth studio album, F.A.M.E. (2011).\n\n2011\u20132012: Careless World: Rise of the Last King\n\nTyga in 2012\n\nCareless World: Rise of the Last King was his second studio album. The album was released on February 21, 2012, on Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records, and Universal Republic Records. It was a shift from the poppy dance sound exemplified on his previous effort, No Introduction, and geared towards the gangsta rap style first heard in his collaborative album with Young Money, We Are Young Money (2009).[24] Tyga stated that the album shows he has grown up but still relates to the kids. In preparation for the album, Tyga released the mixtape #BitchImTheShit in December 2011.\n\nThe album was preceded by four singles. Its first, \"Far Away\" (featuring Chris Richardson), was released on May 17, 2011, and peaked at 86 on the Billboard Hot 100.

In August, he released the mixtape Well Done 3, which spawned by the single \"Do My Dance\" (featuring 2 Chainz). The song peaked at number 79 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAlso that year, Tyga also produced and co-directed (with Justice Young) a multi-AVN Award-nominated crossover adult film, Rack City: The XXX Movie, which starred Skin Diamond, Jada Fire, Ice La Fox, Sophie Dee, Lexington Steele, Kristina Rose, London Keyes and Daisy Marie.[25][26] He also signed the soundtrack, which includes the hits \"Rack City\" and \"Faded\" together with several original songs, and he appeared in the film in a non-sex role.[27][28][29][30][31][32]\n\n2012\u20132013: Hotel California\n\nTyga in 2013\n\nTyga's third studio album, Hotel California, was released on April 9, 2013.
