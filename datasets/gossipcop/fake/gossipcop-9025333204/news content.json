She also managed to juggle her growing passion for acting and studied drama at Somerset College. At the age of 17, Margot moved to Melbourne in order to pursue a career as an actress.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly Work in Australia\n\nMargot Robbie began her acting career in her native Australia, appearing in low-budget independent films such as \"ICU\" and \"Vigilante\" while still a teenager. She quickly gained exposure through national television commercials and landed guest roles on popular Australian shows like \"The Elephant Princess\" and \"City Homicide.\" Her breakthrough in her home country came in 2008 when she was cast as Donna Freedman on the long-running soap opera \"Neighbours.\" Originally intended to appear in a short-term role, Robbie's charm and talent made her a fan favorite, and she became a series regular.

Her performance turned Harley Quinn into a cultural phenomenon and made Robbie a household name.\n\nShe followed up with roles in \"Goodbye Christopher Robin\" (2017) and \"I, Tonya\" (2017), the latter becoming one of her most acclaimed performances to date.

The movie drew praise for Robbie's energy, comedic timing, and commitment to reimagining the character on her own terms.\n\nRecent Work and Ongoing Projects\n\nIn the years that followed, Robbie continued to expand her creative reach. She voiced Flopsy again in \"Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway\" (2021) and appeared as Harley Quinn once more in James Gunn's \"The Suicide Squad\" (2021). Through LuckyChap Entertainment, she produced the darkly comedic thriller \"Promising Young Woman\" (2020), which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nHer biggest success came in 2023 with \"Barbie,\" which she both produced and starred in. Directed by Greta Gerwig, the film became a cultural event and one of the highest-grossing movies of all time, surpassing $1.4 billion worldwide. Robbie's dual role\u2014as both the lead performer and creative force behind the project\u2014was widely praised, cementing her status as one of the most influential figures in contemporary Hollywood.\n\nRelationships\n\nIn 2014, Margot Robbie began dating British assistant director Tom Ackerley, whom she met on the set of \"Suite Fran\u00e7aise.\" The couple married in a private ceremony in Byron Bay, Australia, in December 2016.
