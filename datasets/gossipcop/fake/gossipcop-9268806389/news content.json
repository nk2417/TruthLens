The daytime talk show host gushed about how beautiful Portia is after her People\u2019s Choice Awards this past week.\n\nEllen and Portia have been struggling to keep their marriage alive these last few months. And now Ellen is apparently trying to squash divorce buzz, despite ongoing media reports about their troubled marriage. Ellen gushed about Portia to reporters backstage at the People\u2019s Choice Awards. In an interview with ET Online, Ellen joked, \u201cIt\u2019s such an accident because she normally doesn\u2019t look beautiful like that.\u201d Was Ellen\u2019s joke a backhanded compliment? Did Portia take her comments the wrong way? That\u2019s what fans want to know.\n\nPrevious reports indicate that Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi have been dealing with marital issues for months now. In fact, insiders claim that Portia even considered quitting her Hollywood career and moving back to Australia. She simply doesn\u2019t want to deal with any of her marital drama anymore.\n\nBack in November, it was reported that Portia felt suffocated in her marriage. Apparently, Ellen is a different person behind closed doors. Her fans know her as a fun-loving and positive television talk show host, but her friends and family members see it differently. Insiders indicate that Ellen loves to control and micro-manage every aspect of Portia\u2019s life. She feels like she lives in a golden cage simply because Ellen is supposedly pulling all the strings in their marriage.\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi divorce reports have floated around for months now. Back in July, Ellen even took Portia to the Wimbledon Finals in London just to prove to the media that they were in fact still together.\n\nOf course, this isn\u2019t the first time Ellen has made headlines for her questionable behavior. Earlier this month eyewitnesses claim that Ellen was confronted by a waitress after she failed to leave a tip at a caf\u00e9. Fellow comedienne Kathy Griffin also called Ellen out for her supposed two-face character.\n\nSo far, Ellen DeGeneres herself has not made any comments about the divorce reports. Yet, her fans know that the truth will come out sooner rather than later. Do you agree? What are your thoughts? Drop us a line in our comments section below.
