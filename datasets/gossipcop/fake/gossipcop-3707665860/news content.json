Period. End of report.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly kept talking after the \u201cperiod\u201d and \u201cend of report.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly said, \u201cThere are laws in this country\u2026 I don\u2019t give a damn if a woman shows up in a bikini to the office, that doesn\u2019t make it all right\u2026 for her superior to harass her. It makes it OK for her boss to say go home and change. That\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThere was still more after \u201cthat\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly said, \u201cThe truth is, sexual harassment has nothing to do with wardrobe. It has to do with power and control\u2026 How insulting to men! Like they are animals who can\u2019t contain themselves if a woman shows part of her thigh\u2026 How about we not pile on Donna.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly said, \u201cHow about we use this moment to encourage women to find their own voices despite the risks and to stand up for themselves, which is hard enough without rich, powerful, well-connected fashion moguls lecturing them on their clothing choices. And speaking of fashion choices, here\u2019s one for you: I\u2019m done with Donna Karan.\u201d\n\nThe audience applauded Megyn\u2019s apparent boycott (how brave!), who then said, \u201cI want her to come on\u2026 and we can have an honest discussion about how she feels.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly welcomed Katy Tur to the stage to talk about Ivana Trump\u2019s statement about being the real First Lady.\n\nMegyn Kelly tried and failed to imitate Ivana Trump\u2019s accent.\n\nMegyn Kelly teased Edie Falco\u2019s appearance in promotion of, duh, Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders.\n\nMegyn Kelly sat down with Edie Falco in a pre-taped interview.\n\nEdie Falco said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t do it for the money,\u201d and suggested she believed the brothers were abused by their parents.\n\nMegyn Kelly teased the next segment by saying, \u201cComing up, the truth about infidelity, and the warning signs every spouse should know. But first on a lighter note, cocktails and conversation with Valerie Bertinelli!\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly welcomed Valerie Bertinelli to the stage.\n\nValerie Bertinelli taught Megyn Kelly how to make an Irish coffee.\n\nMegyn Kelly and Valerie Bertinelli took a sip of Irish coffee.\n\nThe audience applauded because there\u2019s nothing live studio audiences love more than the mere suggestion of alcohol.\n\nValerie Bertinelli began teaching Megyn Kelly how to make a margarita.\n\nValerie Bertinelli muddled the lime.\n\nMegyn Kelly asked Valerie Bertinelli, \u201cWhat is muddling?\u201d\n\nValerie Bertinelli explained muddling.\n\nMegyn Kelly used a shaker and said, \u201cI had a blender explode on me not long ago!\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly provided no additional details about said blender explosion.\n\nMegyn Kelly dumped the contents of the shaker into the glass Valerie Bertinelli rimmed with salt without putting the strainer lid on top. (See the Clip of the Day.)\n\nValerie Bertinelli said, \u201cOh Megyn,\u201d and the audience cackled.\n\nValerie Bertinelli caressed Megyn Kelly\u2019s arm, said, \u201cYou\u2019re so pretty, you\u2019re so pretty,\u201d and explained that she needed to strain the lime and jalape\u00f1os out of the margarita before serving.\n\nMegyn Kelly attempted to end the segment by saying, \u201cComing up, infidelity, the warning signs every spouse should know, and is there life after the affair.\u201d\n\nValerie Bertinelli said, \u201cI can tell you a little bit about that,\u201d in an apparent reference to Eddie Van Halen.\n\nMegyn Kelly and the audience laughed.\n\nMegyn Kelly returned and asked, \u201cCan a relationship survive and even thrive [after infidelity]?\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly rolled tape of some couple whose name I missed the first time around who dealt with\u2014dun dun dun\u2014infidelity.\n\nApparently the husband, Michael, cheated on his wife whose name I keep missing. Bobby Finger thinks it\u2019s spelled Tirsha, but has never heard this name before and it has not yet been put onscreen.\n\nMegyn Kelly said that Michael \u201cmoved into the basement\u201d after his affair was revealed so that he would be close to the kids.\n\nMichael said, \u201cDuring all my thinking time in the basement, I reflected a lot on what caused the affairs.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly said, \u201cMichael stayed in the basement for six weeks as the couple remained in counseling.\u201d\n\nBobby Finger asked, \u201cWhat the hell is this show and why do these people keep speaking in somber tones about \u2018the basement.\u2019\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly welcomed Michael and Tirsha to the stage and asked how they\u2019re doing.\n\nTirsha said, \u201cWe\u2019re doing great! As far as the marriage\u2026 we\u2019re better now than we have ever been\u2026 We\u2019ve gone through the ugly, we\u2019ve gone through the worst.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly asked if Michael had addressed the issues (i.e. \u201cnot being appreciated\u201d) that made him cheat to begin with.\n\nMichael said he had.\n\nMegyn Kelly said, \u201cForgive me for asking this, this is indelicate, but I know you took some of the affair partners home to your marital bed.\u201d\n\nMichael said, \u201cNo, it was in the home, but not in our bed.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly said, \u201cTo your home. To your home. So, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s been a source of pain, and I think the question is why? Why? Why would you do that?\u201d\n\nTirsha looked at Michael all yeah bish why.\n\nMichael said, \u201cIt was a way to fill the need at the time.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly asked another one-word question, saying, \u201cAnd you managed to find forgiveness. How?\u201d\n\nTirsha said, \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a process. And I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about forgiveness, and forgiveness initially is almost a selfish thing. Because you have to forgive to not let this consume yourself to that level, to not have that bitterness consume you, to not have this revenge consume you. Because that\u2019s not healthy. And that\u2019s not the woman that I wanna be. I\u2019m a fun person. I\u2019m a happy person. I didn\u2019t want that to change. And so forgiving was to keep myself intact. To not lose myself through this\u2026 He worked his butt off for two years to get that trust back\u2026\u201d\n\nMegyn teased something about how affairs might be helpful for relationships.\n\nMegyn Kelly welcomed yet another couple who spoke like a self-help book. One of their names was Anne.\n\nAnne said, \u201cWhen a tragedy like this hits you, it\u2019s either gonna destroy you, it\u2019s gonna define you, or it\u2019s gonna develop you\u2026 I had to grow as a person and in marriage, two halves don\u2019t make a whole\u2026\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly asked some infidelity expert named Esther Perel about warning signs for infidelity.\n\nEster Perel said looking for signs is sorta bullshit, saying, \u201cWhen you don\u2019t see, it\u2019s not because you\u2019re a fool or\u2026 you\u2019re not looking. It\u2019s because you\u2019re trying to protect an entire life that you have built.\u201d\n\nTirsha said she saw no signs and said, \u201cI blamed myself a lot for being dumb.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly asked Michael if their marriage has improved.\n\nMichael said, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly thanked her guests and said, \u201cUp next, supermodel Molly Sims is here. I need her badly! She\u2019s gonna help us turn our everyday messes into something called everyday chic!\u201d\n\nBobby Finger thought, \u201cWasn\u2019t that infidelity segment essentially about turning everyday messes into something called everyday chic?\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly welcomed Molly Sims to the stage.\n\nMolly Sims appeared to be Megyn Kelly\u2019s most excited guest to date.\n\nMolly Sims shared some tips with an audience member named Tracy who has \u201cthree-year-old twins and a messy pantry.\u201d\n\nBobby Finger thought, \u201cAll you have is a messy pantry and you\u2019re seeking the help of Molly Sims?!?!?!\u201d\n\nMolly Sims said to hang a shoe rack on the back of a pantry\u2014putting healthy snacks on the bottom, and less healthy snacks on the top.\n\nBobby Finger narrowed his eyes and grumbled, \u201cI dare any of you to provide proof that Molly fucking Sims hung a damn shoe rack on the back of her pantry.\u201d\n\nMolly Sims said, \u201cSometimes, I\u2019m not lying, i get so many \u2018mama, mama, mama,\u2019 that I\u2019ll hide in the pantry. So sometimes I\u2019ll eat my own snacks. I\u2019ll take conference calls. This is a great easy way! It\u2019s a hack of a hack of a hack.\u201d\n\nBobby Finger thought, \u201cWhat in the fuck is Molly Sims talking about? Does Molly Sims know what a hack is?\u201d\n\nMolly Sims could NOT be stopped, and started talking about other ways to hack, hack, hack! \u201cPrepackage!\u201d she demanded of us all. \u201cTake glass containers, plastic containers in your refrigerator. Cut up cucumbers, red pepper, carrots. I know it sounds like when am I gonna have time to do it, but it\u2019ll make your life so much easier and nine times out of 10 they\u2019re gonna grab something healthier.\u201d\n\nMegyn Kelly did not ask for data to back up that statistic from Molly Sims.\n\nHoda and Kathie Lee said Mandy Moore and Carla Bruni would be on their show today.\n\nMegyn Kelly said, \u201cWe\u2019ll see you tomorrow! Bye ladi\u2014\u201d before 4 New York cut to the local news.
