The Grammy-winning pop icon is set to release her 16th studio album, Here For It All, on September 26. Carey shared the news on Instagram July 21, posting a brief video of herself flipping her hair as a snippet of the title track played in the background.\n\nThe singer dropped a preview of the album in June with the release of single \u201cType Dangerous,\u201d which debuted at No. 1 on Billboard\u2019s R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales and R&B Digital Song Sales charts. She also recently teased her upcoming single \u201cSugar Sweet\u201d just days before announcing the new record\u2019s release date.\n\nHere For It All follows the success of 2018\u2019s Caution, which reached No. 5 on the Billboard 200 chart. The new record is her first with independent music label Gamma, with which she signed a multi-album deal.\n\nIn an interview with Apple Music earlier this month, Carey revealed the new project will reflect both her past and present, including her experiences as a mother. \u201cDefinitely when the album is released, there\u2019s a lot of who I am today, and the last 10 years, the last 14 years [in it],\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting situation when you have kids, and it\u2019s a whole \u2018nother paint job. It\u2019s a whole different thing.\u201d\n\nWhile the 56-year-old was otherwise tight-lipped about the album, she did confirm that there are \u201csome Mariah ballads\u201d on the track list.\n\nWho Is Mariah Carey?\n\nLegendary singer Mariah Carey has recorded 19 No. 1 songs, more than any other solo artist in Billboard Hot 100 history. The native New Yorker became an immediate sensation with her 1990 self-titled debut album thanks to her five-octave range and popular love ballads. By the end of the decade, Carey had released the diamond-certified albums Music Box and Daydream and eclipsed Michael Jackson\u2019s record for most chart-topping singles by an individual. Her 2005 album, The Emancipation of Mimi, became that year\u2019s best-selling record, and the five-time Grammy winner now stands as one of the most commercially successful artists of all time with more than 200 million albums sold worldwide. Her hit songs include \u201cVision of Love,\u201d \u201cHero,\u201d \u201cOne Sweet Day\u201d with Boyz II Men, \u201cWe Belong Together,\u201d and the modern holiday classic \u201cAll I Want For Christmas Is You.\u201d\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Mariah Carey\n\nBORN: March 27, 1969\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Huntington, New York\n\nSPOUSES: Tommy Mottola (1993-1998) and Nick Cannon (2008-2016)\n\nCHILDREN: Moroccan and Monroe\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Aries\n\nEarly Life\n\nMariah Carey was born March 27, 1969, in Huntington, New York, on Long Island to Alfred Roy Carey, a Venezuelan aeronautical engineer, and Patricia Carey, a voice coach and opera singer. Alfred and Patricia divorced when Mariah was 3 years old.\n\nHer parents had three kids together before their split, and Mariah is the youngest. She has an older brother, Morgan, and her older sister was Alison. Alison died in August 2024, on the same day that Mariah\u2019s mother died. Her father died in 2002.\n\nYoung Mariah stunned her mother by imitating Patricia\u2019s operatic singing as early as age 2. She began singing lessons at age 4. Eventually, Mariah developed a voice that spanned five octaves. Few singers have achieved this vocal feat; David Lee Roth and Yma Sumac are among the handful of people to have done so.\n\nAfter graduating in 1987 from Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, Mariah moved to Manhattan. There, she worked as a waiter and a coat check attendant and studied cosmetology while writing songs and actively pursuing a music career at night.\n\nAlbums\n\nGetty Images Mariah Carey had one of the most successful debut albums in music history and followed up her self-titled record with 1991\u2019s Emotions.\n\nWhen she was 18, Carey attended a CBS Records party with Brenda K. Starr, for whom Carey had started singing backing vocals in concerts. Starr convinced Carey to bring along one of her demo tapes. She intended to give the tape to Columbia\u2019s Jerry Greenberg, but Tommy Mottola, the president of Columbia Records (later Sony), intercepted it before she could hand it to Greenberg. After listening to the tape on the way home from the party, Mottola signed Carey immediately.\n\nSince then, Carey has released 15 studio albums (including one soundtrack). All but one made it into the Billboard 200\u2019s top 5, and six albums have reached No. 1. Worldwide, the pop diva has sold more than 200 million albums. She is the fourth best-selling female artist of all time in the United States, behind Rihanna, Taylor Swift, and Beyonc\u00e9. Carey\u2019s 16th studio album, Here For It All, is set to be released on September 26.\n\nMariah Carey and Emotions\n\nAfter signing her first record contract, the burgeoning star set to work on her first album. Mariah Carey (1990) included four No. 1 singles: \u201cVision of Love,\u201d \u201cLove Takes Time,\u201d \u201cSome Day,\u201d and \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Cry.\u201d The self-titled album, debuting that June, went platinum within two months and sold nine million copies by the end of the decade. A critical success to boot, Carey garnered five Grammy nominations, including in all four major categories (Album, Song, and Record of the Year, as well as Best New Artist). She won the latter category at the 1991 Grammy Awards and \u201cVision of Love\u201d won the trophy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.\n\nHer second album, Emotions, was released in September 1991. The title track became her fifth No. 1 single while \u201cCan\u2019t Let Go\u201d and \u201cMake it Happen\u201d were additional hits. The following March, Carey appeared on MTV\u2019s Unplugged. This televised performance was released as an album and a home video, resulting in another No. 1 single (a cover of The Jackson 5\u2019s \u201cI\u2019ll Be There\u201d).\n\nMusic Box, Merry Christmas, and Daydream\n\nCarey soon reached even greater heights. Her next album, Music Box (1993), cut back a bit on the lavish studio production techniques heard in her previous albums and included the No. 1 singles \u201cDreamlover\u201d and \u201cHero.\u201d Music Box also became Carey\u2019s first diamond-certified album, having sold 10 million copies by November 1997.\n\nShe first laid claim to the title \u201cQueen of Christmas\u201d in November 1994 with the arrival of Merry Christmas. The holiday album, which Carey was hesitant to record, combined traditional Christian hymns with new songs, most notably \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You.\u201d Now a modern Christmas classic, the tune has been played billions of times in the past three decades. It\u2019s also one of two Christmas songs to ever reach No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, joining \u201cThe Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don\u2019t Be Late).\u201d\n\nThe Controversial Back Story The History of \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d\n\nAnother diamond-certified album was in store with 1995\u2019s Daydream, which was also nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys. Its first single, \u201cFantasy,\u201d debuted at No. 1, followed by another chart-topper, \u201cAlways Be My Baby.\u201d Carey broke new ground with \u201cOne Sweet Day,\u201d her first collaboration track on an album. She wrote and performed the Grammy-nominated song with R&B group Boyz II Men. Another No. 1 hit, \u201cOne Sweet Day\u201d topped the Billboard Hot 100 for 16 consecutive weeks.\n\nFinal 90s Albums: Butterfly and Rainbow\n\nTwo years after Daydream, Carey released Butterfly, which resulted in her 12th No. 1 hit: \u201cHoney.\u201d The Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u2013produced track demonstrated Carey\u2019s continued interest in hip-hop and R&B. Butterfly also followed Daydream as her second album to debut at the top spot of the Billboard 200.\n\nIn 1998, she and fellow pop diva Whitney Houston recorded the duet \u201cWhen You Believe\u201d for the animated movie The Prince of Egypt. The tune later won the Academy Award for Best Original Song, though the trophy recognized the writer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz.\n\nPop Divas Forever Mariah & Whitney: The Feud That Never Was\n\nCarey rounded out the decade with a seventh album, Rainbow (1999). Many artists pitched in such as Jay-Z, Usher, Missy Elliott, and Snoop Dogg. That October, her duet with Jay-Z, \u201cHeartbreaker,\u201d joined her ever-growing list of No. 1 songs. With it, she surpassed Michael Jackson to become second only to The Beatles for the most No. 1 songs in the United States. Whereas Jackson racked up 13 chart-toppers in the span of 23 years, Carey recorded her 14 hits in just nine years.\n\n2000s: The Emancipation of Mimi and More\n\nIn the early 2000s, Carey hopped around record labels. In April 2001, she signed a deal with Virgin Records, owned by EMI, for a reported $80 million. The partnership lasted less than a year, though not before the release of the Glitter soundtrack. The singer reportedly walked away from Virgin Records with nearly $50 million as part of her severance agreement. In May 2002, she signed a new deal with Universal Music Group\u2019s Island/Def Jam Records.\n\nThe business end of her career newly secure, Carey released Charmbracelet in December 2002. The initial reception launched the album to third place on the mainstream chart, but only one of its songs, \u201cThrough The Rain,\u201d landed on the Billboard Hot 100\u2014at a disappointing No. 81.\n\nGetty Images Mariah Carey\u2019s The Emancipation of Mimi was the best-selling album of 2005.\n\nCarey was back to her chart-topping ways with 2005\u2019s The Emancipation of Mimi. It became the best-selling album in the United States of the year and has now sold 7 million copies. Her 10th record included the mega-hit \u201cWe Belong Together,\u201d which stayed at No. 1 for 14 weeks and won two Grammy Awards in 2006. The Emancipation of Mimi was also named the Best Contemporary R&B Album, bringing Carey\u2019s overall Grammy tally to five.\n\nHer follow-up in E=MC\u00b2 (2008) proved she could still produce a platinum-certified album nearly two decades into her career. \u201cTouch My Body\u201d became another No. 1 song, as \u201cBye Bye\u201d cracked the Hot 100\u2019s top 20. E=MC\u00b2 is her fourth and most recent album to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The next year, she released Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel to relatively modest success.\n\nLater Albums\n\nSince 2010, Carey\u2019s once white-hot career has cooled somewhat. Her second holiday album, Merry Christmas II You, arrived that year. Me. I Am Mariah...The Elusive Chanteuse (2014) marked her first original music in five years. It was followed by two Las Vegas residencies and 2018\u2019s Caution, her 15th studio album that earned mention on several albums of the year lists.\n\nCarey\u2019s latest releases have included a compilation album, a Christmas special recording, and a few anniversary editions of her 90s albums. In 2022, she was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Carey returned to Vegas for a third residency in the spring and summer of 2024. Dubbed The Celebration of Mimi, the residency included 16 shows.\n\n\n\nNo. 1 Songs\n\nGetty Images \u201cAll I Want For Christmas,\u201d which Mariah Carey co-wrote and performed, is now a modern Christmas classic that has topped the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nCarey holds the record for most No. 1 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 by a solo artist. With 19 chart-topping tracks, she is one shy of The Beatles\u2019 overall record. Carey has held the top spot in four decades, from the 1990s into the 2020s, making her the first artist to accomplish this feat. Well-aware of her airwave dominance, Carey even released a compilation album in November 1998 of her No. 1 hits up to that point. It was appropriately titled #1\u2019s.\n\nIn December 2019, Carey achieved another milestone when her enduring holiday song, \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You,\u201d topped the charts 25 years after its release setting a new Billboard record for longevity.\n\nCarey\u2019s No. 1 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, in chronological order, are:\n\n\u201cVision of Love\u201d (August 1990, four weeks)\n\n\u201cLove Takes Time\u201d (November 1990, three weeks)\n\n\u201cSomeday\u201d (March 1991, two weeks)\n\n\u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Cry\u201d (May 1991, two weeks)\n\n\u201cEmotions\u201d (October 1991, three weeks)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll Be There\u201d (June 1992, two weeks)\n\n\u201cDreamlover\u201d (September 1993, eight weeks)\n\n\u201cHero\u201d (December 1993, four weeks)\n\n\u201cFantasy\u201d (September 1995, eight weeks)\n\n\u201cOne Sweet Day\u201d with Boyz II Men (December 1995, 16 weeks)\n\n\u201cAlways Be My Baby\u201d (May 1996, two weeks)\n\n\u201cHoney\u201d (September 1997, three weeks)\n\n\u201cMy All\u201d (May 1998, one week)\n\n\u201cHeartbreaker\u201d featuring Jay-Z (October 1999, two weeks)\n\n\u201cThank God I Found You\u201d featuring Joe & 98 Degrees (February 2000, one week)\n\n\u201cWe Belong Together\u201d (June 2005, 14 weeks)\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Forget About Us\u201d (December 2005, two weeks)\n\n\u201cTouch My Body\u201d (April 2008, two weeks)\n\n\u201cAll I Want For Christmas Is You\u201d (December 2019, 14 weeks)\n\nMovies\n\nCarey took her creative talents and embarked on a movie career in the late 1990s, though her onscreen work has never overshadowed her myriad musical successes.\n\nAfter appearing in The Bachelor (1999), she starred in the semi-autobiographical Glitter (2001) as an aspiring singer seeking to making it big while navigating her relationship. Carey recorded the accompanying soundtrack album in addition to acting in the lead role. A month before Glitter was due in theaters, Carey was hospitalized and cancelled all her public appearances to promote the movie. The release of Glitter was subsequently pushed back from late August to late September 2001. Neither the movie nor the soundtrack generated much traction.\n\nCarey didn\u2019t stop acting there. She also had roles in the mob drama WiseGirls (2002) with Mira Sorvino, the indie flick Tennessee (2008), the Oscar-winning drama Precious (2009), and another Lee Daniels\u2019 drama The Butler (2013). For Precious, Carey transformed from her high-glam diva persona into a nearly unrecognizable welfare caseworker and delivered a career-best performance.\n\nIn 2015, the Queen of Christmas starred in and directed A Christmas Melody, a holiday movie on the Hallmark Channel. Two years later, Carey lent her legendary voice to roles in two animated voices: The Lego Batman Movie and The Star. She also made cameos in the comedies You Don\u2019t Mess with the Zohan (2008), Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping (2016), and Girls Trip (2017).\n\nAmerican Idol and Mariah\u2019s World\n\nThe \u201cHero\u201d singer has also appeared on various TV shows. In 2012, Carey was chosen as a new judge for Season 12 of the popular reality competition series American Idol. She took a seat alongside Randy Jackson, Nicki Minaj, and Keith Urban and ultimately didn\u2019t enjoy the gig. \u201cThat was the worst experience of my life,\u201d Carey later said. \u201cPitting two females against each other wasn\u2019t cool. It should have been about the contestants instead of about some nonexistent feud [with Minaj].\u201d\n\nIn 2013, Carey voiced a character for three episodes of the animated TV series American Dad! Three years later, she launched The Sweet Sweet Fantasy Tour and Mariah\u2019s World, a TV docuseries on E! network, which followed her European tour.\n\nNet Worth\n\nAs of July 2025, Mariah Carey\u2019s net worth is estimated at $350 million. The bulk of her wealth stems from her music career, with royalties from \u201cAll I Want For Christmas Is You\u201d accounting for a considerable portion. Various news outlets have pegged her annual take-home between $2.5 million and $3 million. In 2023, a music industry veteran told the Associated Press that the tune, which Carey co-wrote, was likely to exceed $100 million in lifetime earnings that holiday season.\n\nCarey has also made money from her acting work and TV appearances. For judging one season of American Idol, Carey was reportedly paid $18 million. Elsewhere, she secured a book deal for her 2020 memoir, . \u201cI want to tell the story of the moments\u2014the ups ad downs, the triumphs and traumas, the debacles and the dreams that contributed to the person I am today,\u201d she said in her book announcement.\n\nMariah Made the List The Best Memoirs by Musicians\n\nCapitalizing on her star power, Carey is an active fundraiser for The Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that provides free summer vacations to disadvantaged children in New York City, and is the co-founder of Camp Mariah, one of the organization\u2019s initiatives.\n\nEx-Husbands and Kids\n\nGetty Images Mariah Carey and Tommy Mottola were married for five years, from 1993 to 1998.\n\nCurrently single, Carey has been married twice and has two kids.\n\nIn June 1993, the singer married music executive Tommy Mottola in a spectacular ceremony at Manhattan\u2019s St. Thomas Episcopal Church. Their relationship began professionally in the late 1980s. Mottola, then the president of Columbia Records, listened to Carey\u2019s demo tape and quickly signed her to the label. By 1991, they had begun dating despite their 20-year age gap. Carey was 24 and Mottola 43 when they tied the knot.\n\nThe marriage was an unhappy one for Carey, who has since described Mottola as \u201ccontrolling\u201d and compared the marriage to prison. \u201cThere was no \u00adfreedom for me as a human being,\u201d she told Cosmopolitan in 2019. \u201cIt was almost like being a prisoner.\u201d The couple divorced in 1998, and Mottola wrote in his 2013 memoir that their relationship was \u201cabsolutely wrong and inappropriate.\u201d\n\nGetty Images Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon got married after several weeks of dating and later had two kids together.\n\nCarey\u2019s second husband was rapper and actor Nick Cannon, who is 10 years her junior. The pair began a whirlwind relationship after he appeared in her music video for \u201cBye Bye.\u201d After dating for less than two months, the couple married on April 30, 2008, in a secret ceremony in the Bahamas.\n\nSoon after, Carey became pregnant, news she reluctantly shared in a now-controversial 2008 interview on The Ellen Degeneres Show. Degeneres pressured Carey into announcing the pregnancy on air by offering her champagne. \u201cI was extremely uncomfortable with that moment is all I can say,\u201d Carey told Vulture in 2020. \u201cAnd I really have had a hard time grappling with the aftermath.\u201d The singer suffered a miscarriage, something that she had prior experience with, after the TV appearance.\n\nGetty Images Mariah Carey hosted a 2016 Halloween party, which her ex-husband Nick Cannon and their twins, Monroe and Moroccan, attended.\n\nBut eventually, Carey and Cannon did become parents. Carey announced they were expecting in October 2010 and memorably performed a Christmas special with her baby bump on full display. The 41-year-old singer gave birth to twins on her fourth wedding anniversary in April 2011. Her daughter, Monroe, is nicknamed \u201cRoe,\u201d and her son, Moroccan, goes by \u201cRoc.\u201d\n\nRelated Story 11 Musicians Who Have Performed While Pregnant\n\nCarey and Cannon stayed together for six years before announcing their separation in August 2014. Their divorce was finalized in 2016. The former couple has continued to co-parent their kids.\n\nIn addition to her ex-husbands, Carey has had other serious relationships. She dated Latin singer Luis Miguel for three years, beginning around 1998. They reportedly ended things in summer 2001. After splitting for her second husband, Carey got engaged to Australian businessman James Packer in January 2016, but that October, it was announced that the couple had split.\n\nGetty Images Mariah Carey and ex-boyfriend Bryan Tanaka dated for seven years.\n\nMost recently, Carey\u2019s long-term boyfriend was Bryan Tanaka, one of her backup dancers who was also featured in her reality show Mariah\u2019s World. She confirmed the relationship in 2017. After seven years together, Tanaka announced their breakup in December 2023.\n\nBipolar Diagnosis\n\nIn July 2001, Carey was admitted into a New York\u2013area hospital and put under psychiatric care after suffering what her publicists called a \u201cphysical and emotional collapse.\u201d Carey was released from the hospital after two weeks but not before she was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder.\n\nFor years, Carey kept her mental health struggles a secret. She finally shared details in an April 2018 cover story for People. After her 2001 diagnosis, the singer said she refused to acknowledge it for years. \u201cUntil recently I lived in denial and isolation and in constant fear someone would expose me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was too heavy a burden to carry, and I simply couldn\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d\n\nCarey said she turned things around after finally reaching out for help and that she began undergoing therapy and taking medication regularly. \u201cI\u2019m just in a really good place right now, where I\u2019m comfortable discussing my struggles with bipolar II disorder,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful we can get to a place where the stigma is lifted from people going through anything alone. It can be incredibly isolating. It does not have to define you and I refuse to allow it to define me or control me.\u201d\n\nQuotes\n\nNever, never listen to anybody that try to discourage you.\n\nForget the image, forget the ensemble, forget the rumors, forget the short skirts, the big hair, whatever! I owe this to the fans, and I will never forget you.\n\nFact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
