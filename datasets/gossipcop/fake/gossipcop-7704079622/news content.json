I am tired of being a seen as a mere beauty queen. A woman is far more than her looks. It\u2019s time for movies to recognize the depth in women, and not just their physical appearance.\u201d\n\nGadot reports that the film will be shot in Israel, in Hebrew, her native tongue. Film funds in Israel all rejected the project, maintaining it was too religious, and that the script, also written by Fishman, is filled with Rightist ideology.\n\nMr. Fishman, who is also the film\u2019s producer, says that money for the budget was raised through a \u201chalf-shekel\u201d fundraising campaign.\n\nStarring alongside Gal Gadot will be Israel\u2019s popular actor Yehuda Barkan in the role of Achashveros. The wicked Haman will be played by former United States President Barack Obama, his debut role on the silver screen. Fishman himself will play the male lead alongside Gadot, as Esther\u2019s uncle, Mordechai the Jew, who refuses to bow down to Haman. New Zealand\u2019s popular pop-singer, Lorde, is scheduled for the part of Haman\u2019s wife, Vashti.\n\nFishman, a religious Jew, was asked how he intends to get around the Torah prohibition of hearing the voice of a singing woman in the upcoming movie musical?\n\n\u201cAll of the voices of women will be computer generated and dubbed, as if the actresses were doing the singing,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cWhat about the Torah prohibition of gazing at women?\u201d\n\nFishman has an answer for that as well: \u201cAll of the actresses will wear masks, in line with the tradition of wearing costumes on Purim.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the lead actress wears a mask all through the film, why did you choose Gal Gadot for the role?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wears a mask all the time,\u201d the long-bearded writer/director who spent years in Hollywood as a successful screenwriter before becoming religious and making aliya, replied. \u201cLike all the Jews in Hollywood. They are all pretending to be successful, secular, American personalities, just like the Gentiles, when they are really all Israeli Jews in exile. Just like it was with the Jews of Shushan in the Purim story.\"\n\n\"In addition, a Jew can pretend to be secular, but all Jews are believers beneath their costumes and masks. It\u2019s our hope that this film of the Purim story will wake up Jews to recognize their true selves and inspire them to cast off their masquerades and return to Israel and Torah. Happy Purim! Purim Sameach!\u201d\n\n(Note: Tzvi Fishman was awarded the Israel Ministry of Education Prize for Jewish Culture and Creativity.
