For that reason, many people, Shelton and Stefani included, assumed they would have a quick rebound relationship.\n\n\"I think if Gwen and I were being honest right now talking about this, I think in the back of our minds we both kind of thought this is a rebound deal,\" Shelton reveals. \"I mean, because we're both coming out of a pretty low spot in our lives and we're kind of clinging to each other to get through this.\"\n\nThe couple is still going strong, though.\n\n\"Now here we are, going on three years later, and every day that goes by it just feels like a stronger bond between the two of us and it constantly feels like it's going to the next level,\" Shelton says. \"That's the only way I think either one of us could describe it if she was sitting right here.\"\n\nThe musicians have been especially sweet the last couple of weeks. Stefani celebrated Shelton's birthday over the weekend with dinner at BOA Steakhouse in West Hollywood, California, and a cookout on Father's Day. On Tuesday, Stefani shared snaps from her time with Shelton in his home state of Oklahoma. The couple, along with Stefani's sons \u2014 Kingston, 12, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4 \u2014 spent time on a boat and out in nature.\n\nDespite their obvious love for each other, the duo is in no rush to tie the knot.\n\n\"There is no reason for them to rush into a marriage, so they aren\u2019t,\" a source exclusively told ET back in March. \"Both of them are happy and content with where their relationship is right now.\"\n\nThe source continued: \"They are on cloud nine for each other. They are perfect for each other. They know they have found their true soulmate.\"\n\nIn April, however, the country superstar admitted to thinking about marrying his longtime love.\n\n\"I think about [marrying her]. I don't think it's anytime soon or anything,\" he said during an interview with CMT. \"The more time that goes by, I guess, the closer you'd be getting to that.\"\n\nFor more on the couple, watch below:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/eto_a08_gwen_blake.jpg?h=0f7b0343", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2024-04/MK-Gwen-Stefani-and-Blake-Shelton-1920-x-800-GALLERY-HERO-TEAR.jpg?h=4ebbc9cd&width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/eto_a08_gwen_blake.jpg?h=0f7b0343&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-04/et_041618_gwenblakeduetvidpic.png?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-06/blakegwen.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/eto_a08_gwen_blake.jpg?h=0f7b0343", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/blake-shelton-calls-meeting-gwen-stefani-a-miracle-after-hitting-rock-bottom-104680", "title": "Blake Shelton Calls Meeting Gwen Stefani 'a Miracle' After 'Hitting Rock Bottom'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/eto_a08_gwen_blake.jpg?h=0f7b0343", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Shelton offers up some insight into the start of his relationship with Stefani after his divorce from Miranda Lambert.", "title": "Blake Shelton Calls Meeting Gwen Stefani 'a Miracle' After 'Hitting Rock Bottom'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/blake-shelton-calls-meeting-gwen-stefani-a-miracle-after-hitting-rock-bottom-104680", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Shelton offers up some insight into the start of his relationship with Stefani after his divorce from Miranda Lambert.", "twitter": {"description": "Shelton offers up some insight into the start of his relationship with Stefani after his divorce from Miranda Lambert.", "title": "Blake Shelton Calls Meeting Gwen Stefani 'a Miracle' After 'Hitting Rock Bottom'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/blake-shelton-calls-meeting-gwen-stefani-a-miracle-after-hitting-rock-bottom-104680", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/eto_a08_gwen_blake.jpg?h=0f7b0343", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Blake Shelton Calls Meeting Gwen Stefani 'a Miracle' After 'Hitting Rock Bottom' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani, Miranda Lambert", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
