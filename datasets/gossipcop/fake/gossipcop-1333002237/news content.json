Her candid comments came to light after Piers Morgan revealed the pair had texted each other, after Piers covered the break-up on Good Morning Britain earlier this month. On the show, he said: \"It's always weird when celebrity couples split up saying they have so much love for each other. If they love each other that much, why are they splitting up? They should be more honest and just say, 'We hate each other.'\"\n\nIn his latest column for the Daily Mail's Event magazine, Piers revealed that Cheryl texted him after the broadcast to share her feelings. \"When we came off air, Cheryl texted me: 'I'm so sorry you didn't like my statement, Piers \u2013 perhaps I should have texted you the intimate details in chronological order as it unfolded,'\" the TV star revealed.\n\nCheryl and Liam's love story through the years:\n\nPiers added that the pair had \"always got on well\" so he felt a \"sudden rare pang of guilt\" after making the comments. He apologised and Cheryl replied that she was \"only messing\". He continued: \"Fortunately, Cheryl quickly eased my concern: 'I'm just messing. I hate those kinds of statements too, so cringeworthy. But we don't hate each other. It just didn't work out.'\"\n\nMORE: The detail in Prince George's birthday portrait you might have missed\n\nCheryl, 35, and Liam, 24, announced their split in a joint statement on Twitter earlier this month. The friendly exes, who share a one-year-old son Bear, wrote: \"We are sad to announce that we are going our separate ways. It's been a tough decision for us to make. We still have so much love for each other as a family. Bear is our world and we ask that you respect his privacy as we navigate our way through this together.\"\n\n\u00a9 Photo: Getty Images\n\nCheryl and Liam have a son together\n\nMORE: Tess Daly shares rare photo of daughters\n\nThe Fight For This Love singer has since been spotted out in public, attending Simon Cowell's Syco summer party in high spirits, while her best friends Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts have said she is \"doing really well\".
