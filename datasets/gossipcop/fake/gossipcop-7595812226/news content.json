Why is this? It be they just choose not to spend much time together, or perhaps even that they're trying to give each other space.\n\nSome royal fans, and many national newspapers, have suggested Pippa and Meghan can at times look somewhat similar.\n\nView 7 Images Meghan Markle attends the 25th Anniversary Memorial Service to celebrate the life and legacy of Stephen Lawrence.
