She also gave him $1.3 million at the time of their split.\n\nSpears agreed to the terms through her father, Jamie, who controls her finances through a conservatorship to this day following her highly publicized breakdown in 2007.\n\nSince then, she\u2019s landed two lucrative Las Vegas residencies, gone on tour, released four new albums, five compilation albums, 18 fragrances and a lingerie line.\n\nFederline laments in the documents that \u201c[Spears] is a single woman who lives alone in a 13,264 square foot Neoclassical Italianate villa on 21 acres of land in a gated community with an elevator, a library, a media/game room, 3,500 bottle wine cellar, an additional 1,200 square foot pool house, an orchard, resort-sized pool and spa, lighted tennis court and three-green golf course. In contrast, Respondent lives with his wife, his two minor children from his current marriage, the two minor children he shares with Petitioner and two minor children from a previous relationship in a 2,000 square foot home.\u201d\n\nHe claims that Spears (who\u2019s currently dating hunky fitness junkie Sam Asghari) offers the boys amenities including private chefs, tutors, nannies and other staff, as well as the best toys and gadgets available and that he simply can\u2019t keep up with their luxuries in his 2,000-square-foot home, in which his wife Victoria Prince, their two children and his two children from ex-wife Shar Jackson all live.\n\nFederline has previously rejected attempts to settle the child support battle without litigation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their position that they don\u2019t have to turn over Britney\u2019s financial information, including tax returns, which is required under the California family code. It\u2019s not California celebrity code edition, she has to comply,\u201d Federline\u2019s lawyer, Mark Vincent Kaplan, told Us Weekly Tuesday. \u201cThis is the choice they have made, and they will now have to deal with it. We are still open to try and settling this without judicial intervention.\u201d\n\nNeither a rep nor an attorney for Spears immediately returned a request for comment.", "images": ["https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F100-live-115674573.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115743727.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115485559.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/kevin-spacey-reveals-homeless-living-115762000.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/fergie.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115752191.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fjones-road-black-friday-sale.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1763551750&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fbethenny-frankels-gift-picks-include-115619188.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115742458.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/fergie.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/kevin-spacey-reveals-homeless-living-115762000.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115723827.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/kevin-federline-britney-spears-glaad-media-awards.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115733621.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/minka-kelly-jenna-bush-hager.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115723827.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115742458.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115731438.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2FCMA.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2FKrisJennersaystheseamazingPDRNproductshavebecomehernewessentials.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/kevin-federline-britney-spears-glaad-media-awards.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115757930.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115747784.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/kevin-federline-britney-spears-glaad-media-awards.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/05/23/kevin-federline-wants-60k-in-monthly-child-support-from-britney-spears/", "title": "Kevin Federline wants $60K in monthly child support from Britney Spears", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
