When asked how moving away taxpayer dollars away from public schools to private, parochial, and charter schools is working out, DeVos struggled with a response.\n\n\u2013 Stahl challenged DeVos's claim that \"we have seen zero results\" from federal investment in public schools, and DeVos said that \"test scores vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the world have not gone up,\" even though they have gone up the last 25 years.\n\n\u2013 DeVos cited a study that showed the positive impact of \"school choice\" in Florida, so Stahl asked her about the result of \"school choice\" in her home state, Michigan, that she abandoned out in the cold like whatever humanity the devil might have once had, and DeVos responded, \"there are certainly lots of pockets where ... the students are doing well\", unable to cite which pockets those are exactly.\n\n\u2013 Stahl argued back: \"No, but your argument that if you take funds away, that the schools will get better, is not working in Michigan, where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system here. .... The public schools here are doing worse than they did.\"\n\n\u2013 Stahl asked DeVos if she'd \"seen the really bad schools\" to \"figure out what they're doing,\" and DeVos said, \"I have not intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\"\n\n\u2013 Stahl: \"Maybe you should.\" DeVos: \"Maybe I should.\"\n\n\u2013 DeVos will be appearing on The Today Show Tuesday Morning, and is said to be appointed the same day for a position to deal with gun violence in schools.\n\nElsewhere on 60 Minutes...\n\n\u2013 Also in the interview, when asked if the criticisms she receives hurts, DeVos said, \"Sometimes it does. ... I think I'm more misunderstood than anything.\"\n\n\u2013 Trump's lawyers are reportedly trying to stop a Stormy Daniels segment from airing on 60 Minutes March 18th.\n\n\u2013 Oprah appeared for a story about trauma care and public schools in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\n\nBetsy DeVos could have lived the rest of her dumb life as an unknown billionaire but apparently she had to seize the opportunity to make children's lives infinitely shittier \u2014 Leslie Grossman (@MissLeslieG) March 12, 2018\n\nTrump supporters! I have a super basic question for you. I\u2019m being sincere and I\u2019d like to have a real conversation about this.\n\n\n\nPlease watch this video and tell me that you feel confident this woman is going to make education better in this country. https://t.co/8FMESQ9IkK \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) March 12, 2018\n\nThere was some next level messed up parenting going on in the family that raises a Betsy deVos and an Eric Prince. \u2014 Lizz Winstead (@lizzwinstead) March 12, 2018\n\nReminder: Every single Democratic Senator (and two Republicans) voted against the confirmation of the dangerously incompetent Betsy DeVos. The lockstep GOP gave her enough support for Mike Pence to put her in. https://t.co/FTIzGqFi1t \u2014 Mark Harris (@MarkHarrisNYC) March 12, 2018\n\nLeslie Stahl deserves an award for her doggedness and her patience in this interview.
