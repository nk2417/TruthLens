The new issue of Entertainment Weekly offers our first look at Nicole Kidman\u2018s character in the film, Queen Atlanna, alongside Momoa and Amber Heard as Mera. Check out the cover below.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nAtlanna debuted in 1959\u2019s Adventure Comics #260, which focused on the early years of Arthur Curry. The comic depicted Atlanna getting washed ashore by a hurricane, ultimately falling in love with lighthouse keeper Tom Curry, resulting in Arthur\u2019s birth.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly how closely to her comics origins the film will stick, though Kidman has professed her enthusiasm over the experience.\n\n\u201cI got to be [like] a mermaid!\u201d Kidman revealed to The Hollywood Reporter last year. \u201cI got to be a queen, I got to wear a crown\u2026I have a particular way of looking.\u201d\n\nThe upcoming film was directed by James Wan, who mastered the horror world with films like The Conjuring and Insidious before making the leap to big-budget actions films with Furious 7. Kidman teased that Aquaman will appeal to fans of a variety of demographics.\n\n\u201cI got to lie on a rock with my hair strewn, and blood,\u201d Kidman pointed out. \u201cAnd I kind of liked it.\u201d\n\nWan also teased that the world he\u2019s exploring in the film marks uncharted territory for the filmmaker.\n\n\u201cThe water world my movie takes place in is so separate and so far apart from previous DC movies it\u2019s like I\u2019m making my own sci-fi fantasy film,\u201d Wan shared with Entertainment Weekly. \u201cThis is a whole new underwater world nobody has seen before in live action.\u201d\n\nFans of Aquaman enjoyed his appearance in Justice League, though the ways in which his underwater encounters were handled left much to be desired. According to former president of DC Entertainment Geoff Johns, the new film will appease devout fans.\n\n\u201cThe underwater stuff has never been executed like this before,\u201d Johns confessed. \u201cThe visual effects shots coming in are just beautiful. James can switch modes from horror to big bright colorful action to really emotional scenes. He\u2019s so able to hit all these different genres.\u201d\n\nFootage from the film was recently screened at CineEurope, likely confirming audiences\u2019 first look at an Aquaman trailer debuting in the near future.\n\nAquaman lands in theaters on December 21.\n\nHow do you think Atlanna looks in the new image?
