Preparations are afoot to announce their rise to the throne by the end of December. The Queen wants to star 2018 in a positive way so they can turn the opinion polls around,\u2019 a top palace source reveals.\n\n\u2018The recent opinion polls are a disaster for the monarchy, there are no two ways about it,\u2019 says the palace courtier. \u2018This was the first time the Queen had watched on as another member of the royal family placed the wreath at the Remembrance Day service, and she saw it as the first step in the changing of the guard.\n\nBut the outcry from the public and the fact that so many people disapprove of Charles taking over the throne has really set a cat among the pigeons. The Queen has always been nervous of handing the reins to Charles and Camilla \u2013 her preferences has always been to make William and Kate the next king and queen, as she really feels they\u2019re the future of the monarchy.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese latest opinion polls reveal that over the past two years support for the monarchy is the lowest it\u2019s ever been, and experts claim the lack of support for Charles is a major problem of the Queen.\n\n\u2018The proportion of people who advocate for William to be crowns as the next monarch has reached its highest point since our monarchy tracker began,\u2019 James Endersby, managing director of Opinium Research, told The Express.\n\nNow the Queen is \u2018talking to her advisers on the legalities of moving Prince William to be next in line. It\u2019s what she has always wanted to do and now she just needs to make it happen.\u2019\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea \u2013 out now!\n\nAdvertisement", "images": ["https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/chrissie-swan-the-shortcut-queen-691e509abfe28.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-13t111849.371-691523f39f6e6.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/131299/kate-middleton-style-1.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/NewIdea-2-Logo.png?fit=128%2C128", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/04/New-Header-2.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/19184/wills-and-kate-pre.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/Logo-1.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/untitled-design-2025-11-13t155101.395-691563c9075e3.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/131095/untitled-design-2023-11-08t103411331.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wordpress-featured-image-template-35-691e75ed0477e.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/19184/wills-and-kate-pre.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/icon-phosphor-circle.svg", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/07/NIFLOGO_Organge.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-18t171832.263-691c0fd21ad3d.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/19183/charles.jpg?resize=1024%2C694", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/ni2546pm1_marketing-cover_v0.1-691a9098143bf-scaled.jpg?resize=1955%2C2560", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/19182/ni4817-cover-4col.jpg?resize=750%2C1023", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920-x-1080-11-6916b87c8e3c7.png?resize=380%2C200", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-20t100612.179-691e4d7618296.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/08/wp-header-2025-11-14t145312.168-6916a7b31c394.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-14t092603.688-69165b0bdf11b.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/untitled-design-43-691557d7aea0d.jpg?resize=380%2C285"], "top_img": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/19184/wills-and-kate-pre.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["New Idea Team"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newidea.com.au/royals/will-and-kate-christmas-coronation/", "title": "Queen retires: Wills and Kate\u2019s Christmas coronation!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "taboola-author": "New Idea team", "taboola-category": "ROYALS", "taboola-section": "royals", "taboola-pub-date": "2017-11-20T07:27:34+11:00", "taboola-updated-date": "2024-05-11T10:48:29+10:00", "taboola-title": "Queen retires: Wills and Kate\u2019s Christmas coronation!", "taboola-description": "<p>Exciting times ahead.</p>", "taboola-image-url": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/19184/wills-and-kate-pre.jpg?fit=1500%2C800", "taboola-tags": "Duchess Of Cambridge, Duke Of Edinburgh, Kate Middleton, Latest Royal News, Prince Charles, Prince William, Royal Family News, Royal Gossip, Royal News, The Queen, The Royal Family, The Royals", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "It was meant to be Prince Charles' first major step towards taking over the royal throne -
