In fact, KUWTK producer Ryan Seacrest leaving L.A. might also be a sign that the reality show will soon be facing the end, according to Radar \u2018s source.\n\n\u201cMore and more viewers are tuning out every week and at this point it looks like the end is inevitable.\u201d\n\nStill, there seems to be no confirmation yet as to whether or not Seacrest will no longer be producing E!\u2019s Keeping Up With the Kardashians . Although he may be moving to the Big Apple, the 42-year-old TV host revealed that he will still spend a lot of time in L.A. in an interview with Variety after he was named as the co-host for Live!\n\n\u201cI have never lived here before but I have spent a lot of time here,\u201d he told the outlet when asked whether or not he ever tried living in New York.\n\n\u201cI expect to still spend a lot of time in Los Angeles, but I\u2019m excited to take up residence in the Big Apple.\u201d\n\nAccording to the New York Times , KUWTK producer Ryan Seacrest was granted a position in \u201ca high-profile platform\u201d by making him Kelly Ripa\u2019s co-host for ABC\u2019s morning show in preparation for a new competition.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s making sure the show is in the right hands \u2014 one day, eventually, I\u2019m sure of it, I will retire,\u201d Ripa told the outlet, adding a forecast about her new permanent co-host\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cAnd Ryan Seacrest, who is a seamless broadcaster and a kind human being, is the one who can take this show into the future.\u201d\n\nOf course, it is still too early to know for sure whether or not KUWTK producer Ryan Seacrest will be letting go of his project with Kris Jenner and E! especially since he was recently named as one of the co-producers for a Keeping Up With the Kardashians spinoff covering Kylie Jenner\u2019s private life .\n\nAccording to another report from Variety, the host\u2019s entertainment production company Ryan Seacrest Productions is teaming up with Bunim/Murray Productions to make Life of Kylie happen. The report also revealed that Kris will be executive producing the show together with a number of other people from E!.\n\nDo you think KUWTK producer Ryan Seacrest will soon be ditching Kris Jenner and the rest of the Kardashians?
