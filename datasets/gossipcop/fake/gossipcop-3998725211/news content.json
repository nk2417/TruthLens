Bagged a EM!!!\u201d she wrote on Instagram, captioning her video post.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for a follower to ask Minaj, \u201cYou dating Eminem???\u201d Minaj simply replied, \u201cYes.\u201d\n\nNeither Minaj nor Eminem\u2019s reps replied to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment. But while fans wondered if she was serious, sources close to Minaj told TMZ \u201cthe rapper was only joking\u201d and that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing romantic between the two.\u201d\n\nKevin Mazur/WireImage; Gregory Pace/BEI/REX/Shutterstock\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

I\u2019ll talk to you when I get home.\u201d\n\nNicki Minaj/Instagram\n\nThe exchange between Eminem and Minaj, who\u2019s been known to jokingly flirt via social media, came months after Eminem told Vulture that he hasn\u2019t been dating much.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough. Since my divorce I\u2019ve had a few dates and nothing\u2019s panned out in a way that I wanted to make it public,\u201d he explained. \u201cDating\u2019s just not where I\u2019m at lately.\u201d\n\nEminem, who was previously married to ex Kim Scott, went on to reveal that he mostly uses Tinder to meet women. Occasionally, he breaks out of the digital realm and seeks love in the real world.\n\n\u201cI also used to go to strip clubs,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWhat can I say? Going to strip clubs is how I was meeting some chicks. It was an interesting time for me.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Minaj \u2014 who was last linked to Nas \u2014 has been busy, gearing up to release her fourth studio LP, Queen.\n\nSingles \u201cBarbie Tingz\u201d and \u201cChun-Li\u201d are already out, the latter of which she already performed last week on the season finale of Saturday Night Live.\n\nThe full album was originally due on June 15, but Minaj announced on Thursday that the record will now drop Aug. 10. When it does, it\u2019ll be Minaj\u2019s first new album in four years. A tour, beginning in September, is planned as well.", "images":
