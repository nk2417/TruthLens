Shocked eyewitnesses saw how even tight leggings were hanging off the shrinking princess \u2014 as Kate Middleton is battling a killer eating disorder \u2014 as the stick-thin princess compulsively forces herself to throw up after every meal! The Duchess of Cambridge's shocking secret is getting tougher to hide, too, as seen when Kate showed off her frail body while playfully running along with husbandduring a recent royal appearance. Shocked eyewitnesses saw how even tight leggings were hanging off the shrinking princess \u2014 as The National ENQUIRER exposed tell-tale signs of her vomiting after every meal!\n\nMEGA MEGA Princess Diana, who also suffered from bulimia in secret. But, as seen in shocking photos unearthed by The ENQUIRER, Kate's fragile hands keep her from hiding her sickly secret! The beloved 5'9\" royal is now down to a disturbing 89 lbs., as even sickly Queen Elizabeth reportedly fears for the beauty\u2019s survival. Kate\u2019s skeletal appearance has triggered gut-wrenching memories of the mother-in-law she never knew \u2014 the late, who also suffered from bulimia in secret. But, as seen in shocking photos unearthed by The ENQUIRER, Kate's fragile hands keep her from hiding her sickly secret!\n\nInStar InStar Photos such as this image from Jan. 2017 show how Kate is keeping Band-Aids wrapped around her fingers and thumbs \u2014 indicators of what mental health experts call \u201cRussell\u2019s signs,\u201d meaning cuts or callouses caused by weight- obsessed bulimics sticking fingers down their throat to force themselves to vomit up unwanted calories.

They bite down on their fingers and knuckles while putting their fingers down their throat. It\u2019s extremely unlikely she would be injured repetitively in these places. Kate would have to be a carpenter or shuck oysters and clams for a living!\u201d\n\nAKM-GSI AKM-GSI \u201cIt\u2019s a frightful and damaging way to lose weight,\u201d added Dr. Fischer, who has not treated Kate. \u201cShe might feel immense pressure under the spotlight in the royal family, but she has to stop!\u201d And insiders told The ENQUIRER that the mother of two did seek help from a leading British medical expert for the early stages of anorexia a couple of years back.\n\nMEGA MEGA A doctor made several visits to Anmer Hall on Queen Elizabeth\u2019s country estate, Sandringham, where Kate and William live with Prince George and Princess Charlotte. The expert told Kate she must enter a residential treatment facility to beat her eating disorder, the source said.", "images":
