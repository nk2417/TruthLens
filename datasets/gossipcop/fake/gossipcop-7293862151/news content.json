{"url": "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lopez", "text": "American singer and actress (born 1969)\n\nJennifer Lynn Lopez (born July 24, 1969),[4] also known by her nickname J.Lo, is an American singer, songwriter, actress, dancer and businesswoman. Lopez is regarded as one of the most influential entertainers of her time, credited with breaking barriers for Latino Americans in Hollywood and helping propel the Latin pop movement in music. She is also known for her cultural impact through fashion, branding, and shifting mainstream beauty standards.\n\nAfter appearing as a Fly Girl dancer on the sketch comedy series In Living Color (1991\u20131993), Lopez rose to wider fame as an actress with leading film roles in Selena (1997), Anaconda (1997), Out of Sight (1998), and The Cell (2000). She successfully ventured into music with her debut album, On the 6 (1999), which spawned the US Billboard Hot 100 number-one single \"If You Had My Love\". With her second album J.Lo and the romantic comedy The Wedding Planner (both 2001), she became the first woman to simultaneously have the number-one album and film in the United States. Her musical success continued with J to tha L\u2013O! The Remixes\u2014the first remix album to top the US Billboard 200\u2014and This Is Me... Then (both 2002). These projects included the US number-one singles \"I'm Real\", \"Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)\", and \"All I Have\".\n\nLopez established herself as one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses with her roles in romantic comedies, including Maid in Manhattan (2002), Shall We Dance? (2004), and Monster-in-Law (2005). Subsequent albums included Como Ama una Mujer (2007), which broke first-week sales records for a debut Spanish album. After a career decline, Lopez returned to prominence as a judge on American Idol (2011\u20132016) and released her comeback single, \"On the Floor\", from the album Love? (2011). She later starred in the police drama series Shades of Blue (2016\u20132018) and served as a judge on World of Dance (2017\u20132020). Her film career saw an upturn with her critically praised performance in the crime drama Hustlers (2019). She has since starred in Marry Me (2022), The Mother (2023), This Is Me... Now: A Love Story and Atlas (both 2024), while receiving praise for her supporting roles in Unstoppable (2024) and Kiss of the Spider Woman (2025).\n\nLopez has sold over 80 million records worldwide, while her films have cumulatively grossed over US$3.1 billion. Her accolades include a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the Billboard Icon Award, three American Music Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards (including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award), and six Guinness World Records. She has been ranked among the 100 most influential people in the world by Time (2018) and the World's 100 Most Powerful Women by Forbes (2012). Lopez has a large social media following, being one of the most-followed individuals on Instagram. Her other ventures include a lifestyle brand, beauty and fashion lines, fragrances, a production company, and a charitable foundation.\n\nEarly life\n\nJennifer Lynn Lopez was born on July 24, 1969, in the Bronx, one of the boroughs of New York City, and raised in its Castle Hill neighborhood.[5][6][7] Her parents, Guadalupe Rodr\u00edguez and David Lopez, were born in Puerto Rico and met in New York City.[8][9] After serving in the Army, David worked as a computer technician at Guardian Insurance Company.[10] Guadalupe was a homemaker for the first ten years of Lopez's life, later working as a Tupperware salesperson[11] and a kindergarten and gym teacher.[12] They divorced in the 1990s after 33 years of marriage.[11]\n\nLopez is a middle child; she has an older sister, Leslie, and a younger sister, Lynda.[13] The three shared a bed.[14][15] Lopez has described her upbringing as \"strict\".[16] She was raised in a Catholic family; she attended Mass every Sunday and received a Catholic education, attending Holy Family School and the all-girls Preston High School, a private school.[17] In school, Lopez ran track on a national level, participated in gymnastics, and was on the softball team.[18] She danced in school musicals and played a lead role in a production of Godspell.[19] She described herself as a \"tomboy\" and \"very athletic\".[20]\n\nThere was \"lots of music\" in the typically Puerto Rican household,[21] and Lopez and her sisters were encouraged to sing, dance, and create their own plays for family events.[22][23] West Side Story made a particular impression on the young Lopez, who wanted to be an entertainer from an early age.[17] As a teenager, Lopez became \"obsessive\" about dance, stating that \"I practiced until my legs and feet ached\".[24] She learned flamenco, jazz, and ballet at the Kips Bay Boys & Girls Club[17] and taught dance to younger students, including Kerry Washington.[25] After graduating from high school, she had a part-time secretarial job at a law firm and studied business at New York's Baruch College for one semester.[26][27] At age 18, she enrolled as a full-time student at Manhattan's Phil Black Dance Studio, where she had already taken night classes in jazz and tap dance.[16][15][17] Her parents were unhappy with her decision to leave college to pursue a dance career. According to Lopez, her parents felt it was \"foolish\" because \"no Latinas did that\".[19] Her mother asked her to move out of the family home, and they stopped speaking for eight months.[22][28] Lopez moved to Manhattan, sleeping in the dance studio's office for the first few months.[16][15][17]\n\nCareer\n\n1989\u20131996: Professional dancing and early acting roles\n\nLopez's first professional job came in 1989 when she spent five months touring Europe with the musical revue show Golden Musicals of Broadway. She was upset at being the only member of the chorus not to have a solo, and later characterized it as a pivotal moment where she had to \"try harder and become that much more committed\".[29][30] In 1990, she danced alongside MC Hammer in an episode of Yo! MTV Raps,[31] and traveled around Japan for four months as a chorus member in Synchronicity.[17] When she returned to the United States, she was hired as a backup dancer for New Kids on the Block's performance of \"Games\" at the 1991 American Music Awards.[32] She also traveled around America with regional productions of the musicals Jesus Christ Superstar and Oklahoma!.[33] During this period, Lopez also danced in music videos including Doug E. Fresh's \"Summertime\", Richard Rogers' \"Can't Stop Loving You\", EPMD's \"Rampage\",[34] and Samantha Fox's \"(Hurt Me! Hurt Me!) But the Pants Stay On\".[35] Lopez stated: \"I'd dance in a piece-of-garbage rap or pop video for 50 bucks and make the money last a whole month.\"[36]\n\nHer most high-profile job as a professional dancer was as a Fly Girl jazz-funk dancer on the sketch comedy television series In Living Color. The show's choreographer, Rosie Perez said she chose Lopez because \"she had that look that I knew the audience would tune in to\".[37] Lopez moved to Los Angeles in late 1991 for the job; she filmed In Living Color during the day and attended acting classes taught by Aaron Speiser at night.[17] Lopez felt ostracized by the other Fly Girls because of her \"voluptuous figure\", and also clashed with Perez.[37] The head of Virgin Records considered signing The Fly Girls as a girl group to rival the Spice Girls, but the deal fell apart.[30] After appearing as a Fly Girl in seasons three and four of In Living Color, Lopez left to work as a backup dancer for Janet Jackson, and appeared in the music video for \"That's the Way Love Goes\".[30] She was scheduled to tour with Jackson on her Janet World Tour in late 1993 but opted to pursue an acting career instead.[38] Music industry executives expressed interest in giving Lopez a record deal, but she chose to focus on acting.[39] She hired In Living Color producer Eric Gold as her manager. He advised Lopez to lose weight if she wanted to succeed as an actress.[40]\n\nLopez's first professional acting job was a small recurring role on the television show South Central (1994). She was invited to audition for the pilot by a casting director who had seen her speak to camera during a behind-the-scenes In Living Color segment.[17] She then acquired an agent and was cast in the CBS show Second Chances; the series was quickly cancelled, but her popularity with viewers led to her being cast in its spin-off Hotel Malibu.[41] She subsequently appeared in the television film Lost in the Wild (1993).[42] For her first major movie role, in Gregory Nava's 1995 drama Mi Familia, Lopez received a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Actress.[43] She then starred in the action comedy Money Train (1995). The film was not a box office success, though her performance was reviewed positively,[44] which led to her being further noticed in Hollywood.[45] In 1996, Lopez had a supporting role opposite Robin Williams in the comedy Jack, which director Francis Ford Coppola cast her in after seeing her performance in Mi Familia.[44] She next starred opposite Jack Nicholson as a \"calculating Cuban maid\" in the neo-noir thriller Blood and Wine (1996),[39] where David Rooney of Variety felt she delivered in \"juggling\" the \"smoldering and soulful sides\" of the character.[46]\n\n1997\u20131999: Breakthrough with Selena and On the 6\n\nWith her casting as the singer Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez in the biopic Selena (1997), Lopez became the first Latina actress to earn $1 million. She described her salary for the film as a \"statement to the world\",[47] but expressed disappointment that other Latina actors were not being afforded the same opportunities.[48] Despite having previously worked with the film's director Gregory Nava on Mi Familia, Lopez participated in an intense auditioning process and spent time with the late singer's family in Corpus Christi, Texas before filming began.[49][50] Selena was a box office hit, and Lopez's performance received critical acclaim.[51][52] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times described it as \"a star-making performance\" and wrote: \"She has the star presence to look convincing in front of 100,000 fans.\"[53] Lopez received her first Golden Globe nomination for the performance. Nava asked the heads of Warner Bros. to fund an Academy Award campaign for Lopez but was told the Academy would \"never nominate a Latina.\"[54] Later in 1997, Lopez starred opposite Ice Cube in the horror film Anaconda, which received negative reviews from critics but was a box office success.[55] Joe Leydon of Variety found the film \"silly\" but said it deserved \"a little credit\" for being \"the first movie of its kind to have a Latina and an African-American\" as its stars.[56] In the crime film U Turn (1997),[57] Lopez appeared topless in a sex scene that was added by director Oliver Stone during filming. Speaking in 2003, Lopez said it was not something \"I would have chosen to do\" and that she and Stone fought over it: \"It's hard being the only woman on a set.\"[17]\n\nLopez starred opposite George Clooney in the crime caper Out of Sight (1998), Steven Soderbergh's adaptation of the Elmore Leonard 1996 novel.[58] Cast as a deputy federal marshal who falls for a charming criminal, she won rave reviews for her performance.[59][60] Janet Maslin of The New York Times described it as her \"best movie role thus far, and she brings it both seductiveness and grit; if it was hard to imagine a hard-working, pistol-packing bombshell on the page, it couldn't be easier here.\"[61] Turan of the Los Angeles Times described Lopez as \"an actress who can be convincingly tough and devastatingly erotic\" and said the film solidified \"her position as a woman you can confidently build a film around.\"[62] In 2021, Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian named Lopez and Clooney's partnership as one of the best examples of on-screen chemistry in cinema history.[63] Also in 1998, Lopez provided the voice of Azteca in the animated film Antz.[59]\n\nLopez decided to pursue a music career after working on Selena, realizing that she had missed \"the excitement of the stage\".[30] Her new manager Benny Medina sought to position her as \"a brand name that will cross over into all media.\"[30] Lopez, who was \"really feeling [her] Latin roots\",[64] recorded a Spanish-language demo for circulation among prospective labels. With Lopez being a high-profile personality, a bidding war ensued.[65] Tommy Mottola, the head of Sony Music's Work Group, signed her but suggested that she sing in English instead.[66] Her record deal with Sony was described as \"lucrative\", having outbid other offers from Capitol Records and EMI Latin.[67] While Lopez worked on her debut album, Sony \"began a major push\" to feature her with other high-profile entertainers, leading her to appear in the Sean Combs music video \"Been Around the World\" (1997).[65]\n\nHer debut album, On the 6 (1999), named after the 6 Subway line which connected her childhood home in the Bronx to Manhattan,[68] was met with positive reviews and further propelled her public profile.[69][70] The album was a success and Lopez's debut single, \"If You Had My Love\", topped the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 for five consecutive weeks,[70] with another single, \"Waiting for Tonight\", reaching number eight and becoming a celebratory anthem for the new millennium.[71] Other singles from the album included \"Let's Get Loud\", which became one of Lopez's signature songs, and \"No Me Ames\", a duet with future husband Marc Anthony.[70] In July 1999, she performed \"If You Had My Love\" and \"Let's Get Loud\" at the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup closing ceremony. It was watched by over one billion viewers worldwide, exposing Lopez's music career to a larger international audience.[72]\n\n2000\u20132002: Box office success, J.Lo and This Is Me... Then\n\nIn February 2000, Lopez and then-boyfriend Sean Combs attended the Grammy Awards, with Lopez wearing a plunging green Versace silk chiffon dress.[73] The dress generated worldwide attention and became the most popular search query in Google's history, leading to the creation of Google Images,[74] while boosting Lopez's album and movie ticket sales.[75] Later that year, Lopez starred in the psychological thriller The Cell, for which she received a $4 million salary.[69] The film, where Lopez played a psychologist who uses radical experimental therapy to enter the mind of a killer, received mixed reviews but was a box office success.[76] David Edelstein of Slate remarked that the \"imperious\" Lopez was \"trying to look waifishly expectant\"[77] while Amy Taubin of The Village Voice noted that she appeared to be engaged \"in some kind of pouting competition\" \"in lieu of acting.\"[78]\n\nIn January 2001, Lopez became the first woman to have a number-one film and album simultaneously in the United States, with the release of her second album, J.Lo, and her first romantic comedy The Wedding Planner, which co-starred Matthew McConaughey.[79] Lopez had been searching for a romantic comedy role for several years; she wanted to show that she could be \"every girl\", stating: \"I felt like all the women in romantic comedies always looked the same way, they were always white.\"[80] Despite negative reviews, the film opened at number one at the box office and solidified her place in Hollywood.[81][82][80] At the same time, J.Lo debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200; she was the first female solo recording artist under Epic Records to do so since the label's inception in 1953.[83] J.Lo was titled after the nickname she had been given by her fans, with Lopez also adopting J.Lo as her stagename.[84] The album received mixed critical reviews but became the most successful of her career, selling 12 million copies worldwide.[85][86] It produced four singles: \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\", which reached number one in various countries,[70] \"Play\", \"I'm Real\", and \"Ain't It Funny\". A remix of \"I'm Real\" featuring rapper Ja Rule propelled that song to number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[87]\n\nIn September 2001, Lopez performed a two-concert residency in Puerto Rico, which marked her first concerts. It was broadcast that November as an NBC special, Jennifer Lopez in Concert, and became one of the most-watched concert specials of the year, with a US audience of almost 12 million.[88] Also in 2001, Lopez founded her production company, Nuyorican Productions, with manager Benny Medina, and starred in the romantic drama, Angel Eyes, opposite Jim Caviezel.[89] Lopez's performance was well-reviewed,[90][91] though the film was a critical and commercial disappointment.[92] She was slated to star alongside Ricky Martin in a remake of Elvis Presley's Viva Las Vegas, but this did not eventuate.[93]\n\nThere was a time when I was very overworked and I was doing music and movies and so many things. I was suffering from a lack of sleep ... I was like \u2014 I don't want to move, I don't want to talk, I don't want to do anything. It was on that movie, Enough ... I had a nervous breakdown. \u2014Lopez, discussing the \"height of her fame\" [ 94 ]\n\nLopez released two albums in 2002. The first was J to tha L\u2013O! The Remixes, which became the first remix album in history to debut at number one on the Billboard 200.[95] Its singles included \"Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)\" and \"I'm Gonna Be Alright\", which reached number one and ten on the Billboard Hot 100, respectively.[96] Lopez's third studio album, This Is Me... Then, was released in late 2002, and was heavily influenced by her relationship with then-fianc\u00e9 Ben Affleck. It received mixed critical reviews; Billboard's Michael Paoletta noted the \"considerable growth she reveals as a performer and tunesmith\" on the album,[97] while Jon Caramanica called it \"the least interesting music on the pop charts today.\"[98] The album became a commercial success, achieving the highest opening sales week of her career. The album's lead single, \"Jenny from the Block\", which peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100, was viewed as a response to the notion that Lopez had alienated her \"core fan base: the black and Hispanic hip-hop community.\"[99] The album also spawned the US number-one single \"All I Have\".[70]\n\nLopez starred as an abused wife who fights back in the thriller Enough (2002), a role which required her to learn Krav Maga.[92][100] An overworked Lopez suffered a nervous breakdown in 2001 while filming it.[94] The film received negative reviews;[92] Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times felt it was \"tacky material\" and was surprised to see \"an actress like Jennifer Lopez\" involved with the project.[101] Her next film was the romantic comedy, Maid in Manhattan (2002), in which Lopez starred opposite Ralph Fiennes as a maid and single mother from the Bronx.[102] It became the highest-grossing film of her career at the time.[103] Reviewing Maid in Manhattan, A. O. Scott of The New York Times enjoyed Lopez as a romantic lead and said \"her greatest skill as an actress\" was \"her ability to melt without cracking the hard shell of composure she wears.\"[104] Lopez was ranked among the top ten highest-paid actresses in Hollywood in 2002, earning $8 million per feature.[105]\n\n2003\u20132006: Media scrutiny\n\nLopez arriving at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2004\n\nLopez became the subject of widespread media criticism in 2003 due to her public relationship with Ben Affleck and the tabloid depiction of her as a demanding diva.[106] She fired both her personal manager Benny Medina and her publicist in mid-2003; The New York Times reported that movie executives had become frustrated by having their communications with Lopez \"largely filtered\" through Medina.[107] That year, Lopez starred opposite Affleck in the romantic comedy Gigli, which was a box-office bomb and is considered one of the worst films of all time.[103][108][109] Rex Reed of The Observer criticized the lead actors, calling them \"pathetically incompetent\" in both \"craft and talent\".[110] Roger Ebert agreed that the movie \"doesn't quite work\", but found Lopez and Affleck \"appealing in their performances\" and noted the couple's chemistry.[111]\n\nLopez had a minor role opposite Affleck in the film Jersey Girl (2004). Following test audiences' negative reactions to the onscreen couple, her screen time was halved.[112] While she remained one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood during this period,[113][114] Lopez later described this as the lowest point of her career[115] and admitted she felt \"eviscerated\" by the media coverage surrounding Gigli: \"I lost my sense of self, questioned if I belonged in this business, thought maybe I did suck at everything. And my relationship self-destructed in front of the entire world. It was a two-year thing for me until I picked myself up again.\"[116] Months later, she starred opposite Richard Gere in the romantic comedy-drama Shall We Dance?, which was a box-office success.[103]\n\nShe released her fourth studio album, Rebirth, in early 2005. Its title was symbolic of Lopez's hopes for \"a new professional beginning\".[117] It was recorded during a period where Lopez felt \"a little bit lost, trying to get my footing in a new life\", \"I had just gotten married [to singer Marc Anthony] ... I wasn't with Benny [Medina].\"[118] In a review of Rebirth, journalist Alexis Petridis remarked that the title \"suggests even Lopez has realised that something is amiss with her career ... Despite the highlights, you're still left pondering the question: what happened to Jennifer Lopez?\"[119] The album reached number two on the Billboard 200, but failed to replicate the sales of her previous albums.[120] Its lead single, \"Get Right\", however, reached number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming one of her most successful songs.[96]\n\nThe marketing for the romantic comedy Monster-in-Law (2005), in which Lopez starred opposite Jane Fonda, played up her \"Gigli-and-tabloid tarnished image\", and it became a box office success.[103][121] She next starred alongside Robert Redford and Morgan Freeman in the drama An Unfinished Life (2005), which received mixed reviews. Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times predicted that the typical review would be unkind: \"It will have no respect for Jennifer Lopez, because she is going through a period right now when nobody is satisfied with anything she does ... Give Lopez your permission to be good again; she is the same actress now as when we thought her so new and fine.\"[122]\n\nThe next year, she returned to the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 as a featured artist on \"Control Myself\", the lead single from LL Cool J's twelfth studio album.[123] In 2006, she reunited with director Gregory Nava to star in the crime drama Bordertown as a journalist investigating female homicides in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico.[124] The film was negatively reviewed and received a direct-to-video release.[103] David D'Arcy of Screen Daily found Lopez \"unconvincing\" as a journalist.[125]\n\n2007\u20132010: Career downturn\n\nBy the late 2000s, Lopez's commercial success had declined. Her music career \"entered a plateau\", while \"her film career entered a period of some disappointing-to-middling successes\".[126] In 2007, she starred opposite her then-husband Marc Anthony in the music biopic El Cantante, which told the story of Puerto Rican salsa singer H\u00e9ctor Lavoe and his wife Puchi.[127] It did not perform well at the box office and received mixed reviews from film critics; Lopez's performance, which she expressed pride in,[128] drew both praise and criticism.[117][129]\n\nLopez in 2008\n\nLopez released two studio albums in 2007. Her fifth album, Como Ama una Mujer, was her first to be recorded entirely in Spanish.[130] Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly acknowledged that the album offered \"fairly persuasive proof\" that Lopez can sing, but was unimpressed by the \"flaccid torch songs.\"[131] It became the fifth Spanish album to debut in the top ten of the Billboard 200, and achieved the highest first-week sales for an artist's debut Spanish album at the time.[132] The lead single, \"Qu\u00e9 Hiciste\", reached number 86 on the Billboard Hot 100 while the second single, \"Me Haces Falta\", failed to chart. Lopez's sixth studio album, Brave, released later that year, was her lowest-charting album worldwide.[133] Jonathan Bernstein of Entertainment Weekly was disappointed that Lopez had returned to \"listless vocals\" for her \"back-to-the-dance-floor album.\"[134] The album debuted at number 12 on the Billboard 200[135] and produced two singles, \"Do It Well\" and \"Hold It Don't Drop It\". The first peaked at number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, while the latter failed to chart. While pregnant with twins, Lopez embarked upon her first ever concert tour, a show co-headlined by Anthony, in September 2007; the tour was well received.[117][136] She also created, produced and was featured in the MTV show DanceLife, which she described as a \"passion project\".[117]\n\nAfter giving birth to twins in February 2008, Lopez took a career break.[137] She described the next few years as a \"strange time\" as she primarily focused on family and travelling with Anthony while he toured.[138] After rehiring former manager Medina,[139] Lopez released two songs in late 2009, \"Louboutins\" and \"Fresh Out of the Oven\". The songs were intended for her seventh studio album but failed to make an appearance on the Billboard charts, leading to her departure from Sony Music and Epic Records.[140] Lopez's first theatrical role in three years was in the romantic comedy The Back-up Plan (2010).[137] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times was unimpressed by the movie and described Lopez as \"an appealing screen presence with a disappointing big-screen track record. That's probably not all her fault: romantic roles for women often are the provenance of the bland or the blonde.\"[141]\n\n2011\u20132015: American Idol and career revival\n\nA \"big turning point\" in Lopez's career came when she joined the judging panel of the singing competition series American Idol for its tenth season, replacing Simon Cowell. Despite being advised that it was a \"huge gamble\",[142] she accepted the job, as she was \"not getting offered a whole bunch of movies\".[143] Lopez's appearance on American Idol in 2011 returned her to prominence.[143] Hannah Elliot of Forbes described it as \"a remarkable comeback\", writing: \"Idol humanized her. Viewers who knew only an attention-grabbing siren met a hardworking, self-made, empathetic single mother, who got emotional when contestants did well and when they failed.\"[144]\n\nLopez's exposure on American Idol resulted in what Billboard called \"the most impressive reality-TV-based rejuvenation of a music career ever.\"[145] After signing a new recording contract with Island Records, her seventh studio album, Love?, was released in early 2011. While the album itself was a moderate commercial success,[133] the single \"On the Floor\" was the year's highest-selling single by a female artist,[146] and ultimately became the best-selling single of her career.[120] It reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming her highest-charting song as a lead artist since \"All I Have\".[147] The album produced two more singles, \"I'm Into You\" and \"Papi\", which did not achieve similar success.[145] By the end of 2011, Lopez was deemed the \"world's greatest musical comeback act\", based on a study which analysed over one billion Google searches since 2004.[148]\n\nLopez returned as a judge for American Idol's eleventh season in 2012, earning a reported $20 million.[144] That year, she released her greatest hits album, Dance Again... the Hits, to fulfil her contractual obligations with her former label Epic Records.[149] Lopez, who was divorcing Anthony and navigating the \"breakup of a family\", felt as if the album's sole single, \"Dance Again\", had come to her at the \"perfect moment\".[150] \"Dance Again\" reached number 17 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100. Lopez launched the Dance Again World Tour, her first headlining concert tour, in mid-2012. It grossed over $1 million per show.[151]\n\nLopez returned to the big screen in 2012, starring alongside an ensemble cast in the film What to Expect When You're Expecting, which is based on the 1984 book What to Expect When You're Expecting.[152] Lopez voiced Shira, a saber tooth tiger, in the animated film, Ice Age: Continental Drift, the fourth film in the Ice Age franchise.[153][154] Also in 2012, a talent show, \u00a1Q'Viva! The Chosen followed Lopez, Anthony, and director-choreographer Jamie King as they travelled across 21 countries in Latin America to find new talent for a Las Vegas show.[155] In 2013, Lopez starred alongside Jason Statham in the crime thriller Parker, in which she played Leslie. Her performance earned positive reviews, with the Chicago Tribune commending the role for giving Lopez \"an opportunity to be dramatic, romantic, funny, depressed, euphoric and violent. The audience stays with her all the way\".[156] That year, Lopez released the single \"Live It Up\", and was named chief creative officer of NuvoTV.[157][158] She also served as an executive producer of the television series The Fosters (2013\u20132018), a show about a lesbian couple raising a family. Lopez's desire to work on the series was driven by her late aunt, who was gay.[159]\n\nLopez at the 25th GLAAD Media Awards in 2014\n\nAfter a one-season absence, Lopez returned to American Idol for its thirteenth season, earning a reported $17.5 million.[160] Her eighth studio album, A.K.A., was released in mid-2014 through Capitol Records, experiencing lacklustre sales, becoming her lowest-selling album in the U.S.[161] The album produced three singles: \"I Luh Ya Papi\", featuring French Montana, \"First Love\", and \"Booty\", featuring Iggy Azalea.

Then blends 1970s soul with \"streetwise\" hip hop.[97] Rebirth was noted for its \"relaxing\" atmosphere, while Como Ama una Mujer was characterized as \"silkily sedate Spanish Sade worship\".[120] Brave and Love? delved further into dance-pop,[134][395] while A.K.A. and This Is Me... Now saw her return to her R&B roots, though the latter eschews Latin influences.[396][397]\n\nDescribed as autobiographical,[398] most of Lopez's music has centered around the \"ups and downs\" of love, often inspired by her own love life.[399][400] Lyrically, This Is Me... Then is largely focused on her relationship with Ben Affleck; the song \"Dear Ben\" was described as the album's \"glowing centerpiece\".[401] Its sequel album, This Is Me... Now, was informed by her marriage to Affleck, and Lopez's \"psychological journey of the past two decade\".[402] Como Ama una Mujer features introspective lyrics about romance, heartache and self-loathing.[130] Regarding Love?, Lopez stated: \"There's still so much to learn and that's why the question mark.\"[399] Other recurrent themes in Lopez's music have included her upbringing in the Bronx,[30][403] social class[390] and women's empowerment.[404]\n\nLopez has received mixed reviews for her \"light\" soubrette voice,[405] which critics have described as thin,[397] and overshadowed by her music's production.[406][407][408] With On the 6, critics described Lopez's voice as a \"sultry purr\" and \"breathy\";[409][410] Rob Sheffield remarked: \"Lopez sticks to the understated R&B murmur of a round-the-way superstar who doesn't need to belt because she knows you're already paying attention ... She makes a little va-va and a whole lot of voom go a long way.\"[411] Lopez, who often worried about her singing \"not being as strong\" as her other attributes, would later credit ex-husband Marc Anthony for helping her find her \"best singing voice\".[412] Pitchfork described her voice as being \"stronger than ever\" on This Is Me... Now, while opining that \"the thinness of the voice has often been beside the point, if not a boon to her early career\", which was marked by \"Bronx regularness\".[128]\n\nLopez has been criticized for her use of background vocals from demo singers, prompting rumors of ghost singers' vocals being used in place of her own.[413][414] The rumors have been debunked by writers and background singers who worked with Lopez,[415][416] including Christina Milian (\"Play\"), who called the controversy \"funny\" and said: \"It's no different than Michael Jackson having background singers on songs or Britney Spears. This is what music is made of.\"[416]\n\nDance, videos and stage\n\nConsidered one of dance's \"greatest success stories\",[180] Lopez has received praise for her highly choreographed dancing,[405][417][418] and is noted for her technical skill.[419] She has been trained in a range of dance styles, including ballet, jazz, flamenco, ballroom,[420] pole dancing,[421] breakdancing, street dance, and hip hop.[422] Her signature movements include \"clock-wise pivoting with salsa hip circles and sequential torso undulations\".[423] Described by MTV's Madeline Roth as \"some of the most memorable visuals of the 21st century\",[424] Lopez's music videos made her a dominant figure on MTV,[425][426] and helped influence 2000s fashion trends.[427][428] Her music videos are known for showcasing her ability as a dancer,[429] which CNN's Holly Thomas said gave her a \"captivating, commanding presence\",[430] as well as themes of surveillance and fame.[429][431] Her videography and dancing have also been criticized for their provocative nature,[432][433] with Lopez being described as one of the Latin performers whose work \"racialized and sexualized their bodies\".[434]\n\nOn stage, Lopez is recognized for her showmanship, sex appeal, and glamorous costumes, which often include bodysuits.[435][436] Journalists have described her as the \"ultimate showgirl\".[437][438] While being noted to lip sync in the early stages of career,[439][440] Lopez's Dance Again World Tour was praised for showcasing live vocals and choreography synchronously.[405][441][442] In a review of her Las Vegas residency All I Have, Los Angeles Times writer Nolan Feeney remarked that her dancing is \"undoubtedly the centerpiece of the show\".[435]\n\nHer provocative stage performances and costumes have also drawn scrutiny. Robin Givhan of The Daily Beast criticized the nude bodysuit Lopez wore during her performance at the 2011 American Music Awards, calling it \"banal exhibitionism\" which \"cried out for attention in all the wrong ways\".[443] A number of her performances have been deemed inappropriate for television,[444][445] including her controversial appearance at the Moroccan musical festival, Mawazine, in 2015. Moroccan Prime Minister Abdelilah Benkirane called it \"disgraceful\" and demanded that legal measures be taken, while an education group claimed that she \"disturbed public order and tarnished women's honor and respect\".[446]\n\nActing and screen\n\nLopez at the Toronto Film Festival in 2019\n\nLopez's films often see her playing \"relatable everywomen\",[447] with Cady Lang of Time writing: \"A longtime hallmark of Lopez's filmography is her penchant for stories about survivors. Her characters are never shrinking violets.\"[448] Discussing the roles she is drawn to, Lopez said in 1998: \"I don't think of them as strong women ... I like characters that are really part of the story as opposed to window dressing, but I think the interesting thing is that they are real people. Nobody walks around being strong all the time.\"[449] Like her music, a number of her film roles explore class consciousness, including Maid in Manhattan (2002) and Second Act (2018).[450]\n\nFilm critic Stephanie Zacharek described Lopez as \"one of the most gifted and appealing performers of the past two decades ... and yet the movies have rarely known what to do with her and her significant gifts as an actor.\"[451] While Lopez received acclaim for her early film work, The New York Times writer Kyle Buchanan noted that her tendency to star in romantic comedies, and her pop music career, \"lowered her critical bona fides\".[60] Taylor Hackford, who directed Lopez in Parker, said she \"can really act\": \"She knows how to transmit nuances, to make the subtlest of shifts. Does she have humor? Yes. But at the same time she can get into the deepest dramatic areas.\"[118] Lopez, who identifies the romantic comedy as her favorite film genre,[452] has been referred to as the \"Patron Saint of Romantic Comedies\"[451] and the \"Queen of Romantic Comedies\".[453][454]\n\nIn her early films, Lopez played stereotypical roles which signified her as a \"racialized, exoticized\" other. In films such as Blood and Wine and U Turn, her body is fetishized \"through extreme close-ups\" and \"framed as animalistic, primitive, and irresistibly dangerous to the Anglo American male characters.\"[455] This shifted with her role in Selena, which \"affirmed her Latinx identity, and won her the loyalty of that significant section of the U.S. and global audience.\"[203] She has also been criticized for playing ethnically ambiguous parts and tapping into \"the ability to perform a panethnic other\" to commodify herself.[455] Her role as an Italian woman in The Wedding Planner has been described as \"a case of classic Hollywood whitewashing.\"[82]\n\nPublic image\n\nLopez has been a polarizing figure in popular culture.[456][457] Andrew Barker of Variety writes that she \"exhibits a plethora of contradictions\", observing: \"Despite a carefully cultivated image as an imperious pop empress in ludicrously expensive outfits, her signature hits bear the titles 'I'm Real' and 'Jenny From the Block'.\"[120] In 2002, Lynette Holloway of The New York Times described Lopez's image as including \"a dash of ghetto fabulousness\" and \"middle-class respectability\" for mass appeal.[99] The media discerned a shift in her public image upon joining American Idol in 2011,[456][458] with Entertainment Weekly writing: \"Gone was her old cut-a-bitch swagger; J. Lo 2.0 is an all-embracing, Oprahfied earth madre.\"[459] People editor Peter Castro said American Idol made Lopez \"a celebrity of the people\" whereas before, \"there was a huge distance with the American public.\"[458]\n\nLopez performing during her Dance Again World Tour in 2012\n\nLopez is widely celebrated for her curvaceous hourglass figure,[460][461] which earned her the nickname La Guitarra (the guitar).[84] Vanity Fair described her buttocks as \"in and of themselves, a cultural icon\".[462] Recounting her experience on early films, Lopez stated: \"I've always had costume people looking at me a little weary and immediately fitting me out with things to hide my bottom.\"[463] She often wears revealing outfits to accentuate her curves.[464] Author Mary Beltr\u00e1n opined that for Lopez to \"unashamedly display her well-endowed posterior during this time period\" could be viewed as \"a revolutionary act with respect to Anglo beauty ideals\".[465] However, she was also criticized for perceived changes in her image upon launching her music career,[465] which included \"weight loss and lightening her hair\".[466]\n\nConsidered a fashion icon, Lopez is known for her sense of style and \"breaking fashion rules\".[467][84][468] She is recognized for both her \"bold\" red carpet fashion,[469] including fourteen appearances at the haute couture Met Gala in New York City, and her everyday street style, which is \"discussed ad infinitum by the fashion press.\"[470][471] British Vogue said she \"added megawatt glamour to every outfit she wore\",[270] with Billboard describing her style as \"scantily clad\".[472] Lopez's style has been influenced by \"women who epitomize old Hollywood glamour like Rita Hayworth\", as well as her Bronx upbringing and Nuyorican identity.[473] Described as the \"ultimate sex symbol\" of the early 21st century,[474] various publications have ranked her as the most beautiful or sexiest woman in the world, including People,[144] People en Espa\u00f1ol,[475] Vibe,[476] Details,[477] and FHM, with Lopez topping the latter's 100 Sexiest Women list twice.[478] Lopez has criticized \"this funny notion in America that you can't be a mom and be sexy\", stating: \"The truth is that women can be sexy until the day they die.\"[163]\n\nShe has a large following on social media, being the 14th most-followed individual on Instagram and having one of the 50 most-followed accounts on Twitter.[479][480] On the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)'s \"Music Fuels\" ranking, Lopez is the eighth-most-followed musician across Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.[481] She is the richest Latin actress, with an estimated net worth of US$400 million.[482][483]\n\nDescribed as \"one of the most photographed women in the world\",[484] Lopez has long been a tabloid fixture, and admits to having a \"less-than-perfect\" public image.[485][486] Frances Negr\u00f3n-Muntaner wrote that by 1999, \"Internet chat rooms exploded with anti-Lopez babble\" and she became \"one of the easiest moving targets for cheap laughs as well as anxieties about working-class 'loud' sexuality and specifically Latino visibility.\"[487] Much of the media coverage surrounding Lopez in the 2000s \"focused on her dramatic private life\",[69] with several writers describing her as overexposed at the time, despite her continued success.[99][488] Media outlets often liken her to actress Elizabeth Taylor, due to her numerous failed relationships and glamorous public persona.[489][490][491] Her high-profile relationship with Combs was described as having \"defined an age\",[106] with Vanity Fair writing that they entered \"the pantheon of slightly notorious celebrity couples: Liz and Dick, Frank and Ava.\"[492]\n\nThroughout her career, she has also received a bad reputation as being a demanding and outspoken \"diva\",[493][465] something which she denies, stating: \"I've always been fascinated by how much more well-behaved we have to be than men.\"[494] Some of the backlash and fabricated tabloid stories surrounding Lopez have been attributed to her 1998 interview with Movieline, in which she was quoted as criticizing various actors and directors. Lopez, who \"cried for hours\" after the article was published, said the comments were made in jest and she was \"so misquoted and so taken out of context\".[492] In 2003, Lawrence Donegan of The Guardian posited that \"indefensible\" misogyny and racism were to blame for her position as \"the most vilified woman in modern popular culture\".[106] In 2021, Ben Affleck said: \"People were so fucking mean about her; sexist, racist, ugly vicious shit was written about her in ways that if you wrote it now, you would literally be fired for saying some of the things you said.\"[495]\n\nLegacy and cultural impact\n\nEntertainment industry\n\nLopez's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame\n\nRegarded as one of the most influential performers of her time,[496] Lopez is often cited by journalists and academics as the most influential entertainer of Latin descent,[497][498] credited with breaking racial barriers in the entertainment industry.[499][500] She was described as \"the first Latina superstar\" by writer Ned Zeman,[492] and the \"embodiment of the American Dream\" by Robert C. Cottrell in Icons of American Popular Culture (2009).[501] Maer Roshan, editor-in-chief of The Hollywood Reporter, said \"Lopez has broken barriers and redefined what\u2019s possible for women and Latinos in entertainment.\"[502] Often dubbed the \"Queen of Dance\" by media outlets,[503] she is considered a triple threat performer,[203][504][505] and was one of few actors to successfully cross over into music.[506] Rachel Sklar of The Huffington Post called Lopez a trailblazer, writing: \"Beyonc\u00e9, Miley, Gaga, any actress who's ever released an album \u2014 they are all standing on the shoulders of J.Lo. She was a true triple threat \u2014 actress, singer, dancer ... and packaged it sometimes outrageously but always sexily.\"[507] Lopez is considered a pop icon,[508][509] with VH1 ranking her at number 15 on their list of 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons,[510] number 16 on 100 Greatest Women In Music,[511] and number 21 on 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era.[512]\n\nThe highest-paid Latina actress in history,[513][514] Lopez's film career has been credited with paving the way for greater representation of Latino Americans in Hollywood, a historically white space.[515][516][465][517] Biographer Kathleen Tracy opined that \"Lopez blazed a trail no openly Latin actress had gone before\", noting that previous Latina stars cosmetically downplayed their ethnicity and changed their names.[518] Lopez, who achieved \"ethnic 'blind' casting\" with Out of Sight (1998),[519] is noted by biographer James Robert Parish to have \"helped minimize racial boundaries in show business\" by deliberately avoiding stereotypical roles.[499]\n\nWith her musical debut, Lopez helped influence the Latin pop movement in American music, often dubbed the \"Latin explosion\" of the 1990s.[498][520] The Recording Academy called her the \"breakout female star\" of the Latin pop movement,[521] with historian Roger Bruns describing her as \"an influential force in driving a growing Latin cultural influence in popular music\" at the time.[65] Ella Cer\u00f3n of Teen Vogue wrote: \"In an era of blonde, bubblegum pop, there was only one J.Lo.\"[522] She has been credited with paving the way for U.S.-born Latina artists including Selena Gomez, Becky G, and Cardi B,[523][517] and for Latin American artists to venture into English pop music, including Shakira, Thal\u00eda and Paulina Rubio.[524] Along with Ricky Martin, she helped increase the visibility of Latin music in international markets including East Asia and Canada.[425][525] Due to her \"multi-tasking career\", she has been described as \"the next-generation Madonna\",[526] and \"the first woman to demonstrate that a Madonna could be a Latina\".[390]\n\nLopez's music has been credited with helping influence the trajectory of 2000s music,[71] including dance music,[120][389] Latin music,[527] R&B,[528] and pop rap collaborations.[87][71] Billboard magazine described her as having \"helped define an era where hip-hop, R&B and pop all got more cuddly together than ever before\".[529] Scholar Miriam Jim\u00e9nez Rom\u00e1n suggested that Lopez, who represents the \"often-suppressed\" history of Puerto Ricans in hip hop culture, was \"able to traverse the difficult racial boundaries\".[530] In July 2023, Madame Tussauds New York unveiled a wax figure of Lopez inspired by her performance at the Super Bowl LIV halftime show.[531]\n\nCultural influence\n\nIn 2012, Forbes ranked Lopez as the world's most powerful celebrity and the 38th most powerful woman.[144][532] She was named one of Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2018.[533] Lopez's influence has been attributed to her bicultural identity and ability to code-switch.[534] According to Latina magazine founder Christy Haubegger, Lopez was \"the first icon that generationally fits\" young Latino Americans who followed celebrity culture.[457] Lopez was featured on the first cover of Latina in 1996, with editor Galina Espinoza writing in 2011 that there is \"no recounting of modern Latina history without Jennifer\".[535] She has been credited with empowering Puerto Ricans, a group \"which has been subdued to different forms of discrimination\" since Puerto Rico was annexed by the U.S.[536]\n\nJonathan Van Meter of Vogue described Lopez as having \"changed the face of modern celebrity.\"[118] Her ability to start trends has prompted the usage of the phrase \"the J.Lo effect\" in popular culture, which has been used in various different contexts,[537][538][539] including the trend of networks hiring \"big name\" judges for reality competition programs after Lopez's successful casting on American Idol.[540] With her moniker J.Lo, Lopez started a trend of celebrities being given abbreviated nicknames, while \"Bennifer\" began the convention of celebrity couple name blending.[390][541]\n\nDescribed by scholar Helene A. Shugart of the University of Utah as \"arguably the most visible Latina in contemporary mainstream popular culture\", Lopez has been the subject of considerable academic analysis, including in relation to ethnicity, class, \"body politics\",[542] race, Latin culture, and gender.[543][466] While credited with opening \"the door to [Latino culture having a] broader appeal\",[203] Lopez has also been a polarizing figure, generating \"often vehement disagreement about what is and isn't Latino.\"[457] According to journalist Jes\u00fas Trivi\u00f1o Alarc\u00f3n, Lopez \"widened the scope of what it means to be Latina by simply being her. You don\u2019t have to speak perfect Spanish, or Spanish at all, to be proud of your roots.\"[517]\n\nAs a result of the public emphasis on her curvaceous figure, Lopez has been credited with influencing a shift in cultural beauty standards.[390][544][545][546] The surge in popularity of buttock augmentation surgery in the early 2000s was attributed to Lopez.[547][548] In Latin Sensations (2001), Her\u00f3n Marquez wrote: \"Because she wasn't rail thin, Lopez had broken the mold ... Suddenly, it was okay for women to have hips, curves, and a big backside.\"[549] This has been considered a sign of Lopez's social power in \"changing cultural standards within the mainstream media as a whole\".[550]\n\nIn 2014, scientists named a species of aquatic mite found in Puerto Rico, Litarachna lopezae, after Lopez.[551] In Tok Pisin, a language spoken in Papua New Guinea, the term palopa is used to describe non-heteronormative people whose identities may correlate with those who, in Western contexts, identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community.[552][553] In 2019, she was presented with keys to the city of Miami Beach, where July 24 was declared \"Jennifer Lopez Day\".[554]\n\nFashion and branding\n\nLopez (left), wearing an updated version of her iconic green Versace dress, and Donatella Versace (right) in 2019\n\nThe Council of Fashion Designers of America presented Lopez with its Fashion Icon Award in 2019 for her \"long-standing and global impact on fashion\".[467] Her green Versace \"Jungle Dress\" was voted the fifth most iconic red carpet dress of all time in a poll run by The Daily Telegraph.[555] The dress had a significant impact on the fashion industry, celebrity endorsements, and the evolution of red carpet fashion.[556][469][557][558] The images of Lopez wearing the dress became the most popular search query of all time at that point, and subsequently led to the creation of Google's image search.[559] Lopez has been credited with popularizing various fashion and beauty trends throughout her career.[560][561][128][562][563] In 2003, she inspired a trend of curvier mannequins being designed, which fuelled a rise in sales for manufacturers and retailers.[564][565][566] Lopez's personal style and brand deals have had a considerable effect on sales in the fashion industry.[526][562][567] The success of Louis Vuitton's fall 2003 campaign, for which Lopez was the brand's model, led to more Hollywood stars \"becoming image models of fashion and cosmetic labels\".[568] In 2021, The Daily Telegraph reported that she was among ten celebrities whose personal style choices drove the greatest spikes in searches and news coverage for brands.[569] Her appearance at Milan Fashion Week in 2019 generated over $31.8 million in total media impact value.[570][571]\n\nDescribed as a \"branding pioneer\", Lopez has been credited with ushering in a new era of celebrity branding.[558][572][118] Her first fragrance, Glow by JLo, influenced the rise of celebrity fragrances in the 2000s.[573][574][558][575] Her fragrance line became the most successful celebrity line in the world, with sales exceeding $2 billion as of 2012 .[576] Lopez's clothing brand was one of the first celebrity fashion lines;[577] scholars have credited her with redefining \"how fashion is produced and entwined with other artistic endeavors\",[524] and popularizing a trend of utilizing racial ambiguity for branding purposes in fashion and cosmetics.[578] As of 2022, her business ventures have cumulatively earned over US$5 billion in sales globally.[579]\n\nAchievements\n\nAs of 2022 , Lopez has sold more than 80 million records worldwide and amassed over 15 billion streams; her films have grossed a cumulative total of US$3.1 billion while her business ventures have cumulatively made over US$5 billion in consumer sales.[579] She remains the only female entertainer to have a number-one album and film simultaneously in the United States.[580] The Guinness World Records acknowledged J to tha L\u2013O! The Remixes (2002) as the first number-one remix album on the U.S. Billboard 200,[581] and recognized \"On the Floor\" as the \"Highest Viewed Female Music Video of All Time\" in 2012.[582] Billboard named Lopez the top Hot 100 female artist and the Greatest Pop Star of 2001.[583][474] Billboard ranked her as the ninth-greatest dance club artist of all time in 2016, having scored 18 number-one songs on its Dance Club Songs chart.[584][70] The magazine also ranked her at number 22 on its \"Top 100 Women Artists of the 21st Century\" list (2025).[585] She was named the top Latin touring artist of the decade by Pollstar in 2021.[586]\n\nFor her contributions to the music industry, Lopez was honored by the World Music Awards with the Legend Award in 2010,[587] and was presented with the prestigious landmark 2,500th star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2013.[588] At the 2014 Billboard Music Awards, she became the first female recipient of the Billboard Icon Award.[589] In 2017, she was awarded the Telemundo Star Award at the Billboard Latin Music Awards.[590] Lopez received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award during the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, making her the first Latin performer to receive the honor.[591] She later received the Icon Award at the iHeart Radio Music Awards in 2022.[592] Outside of music, Univision presented her with the World Icon Award in its Premios Juventud in 2013.[593] She received the Generation Award at the MTV Movie & TV Awards for her contributions to film and television in 2022.[594]\n\nDiscography\n\nFilmography\n\nFilms
