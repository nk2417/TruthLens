Everyone at GMA is thrilled to have Michael on the show full-time. He\u2019s a fantastic addition to the team.'\n\nRoberts publicly stated how fond she was of Strahan too earlier this week when she posted a photo of him laughing on the set to her Twitter account - on Valentine's Day.\n\nShe wrote that Strahan 'does make me laugh...he brightens my morning every day!'\n\nThat was followed by an emoji with two giant heart-eyes.\n\nStrahan returned the love by retweeting Roberts and adding a emoji of a kissing face that same day.\n\nLive in person: Rinaldi's report came during the show's Big Board segment, and he was live in studio that day\n\nRumors of tension on set are nothing new to Strahan.\n\nNews of his departure last April from Live With Kelly & Michel was surrounded by drama after Ripa did not turn up for work the day after it was announced he was moving to Good Morning America full-time come September.\n\nRipa, it turned out, had been blindsided by the news and it was a week before she returned to her hosting duties.\n\n'I wasn't surprised by her reaction at all, but I can't control somebody else's actions,' he reflected later in a interview with People.\n\n'I was there four years, and it's about more than just being in front of the camera.'\n\nStrahan, 44, who had been on Live! for four years, added: 'Toward the end of it all, we didn't communicate that much. I kinda looked at it like, \"It was what it was.\"\n\nKeeping quiet: Strahan and Roberts were also seen quietly sitting next to one another during breaks\n\nRoberts expressed her love for Strahan on Valentine's Day, tweeting about how much he makes her laugh\n\nStrahan shared his admiration for his co-host by retweeting the message and adding an emoji\n\n'The show was going well? We're all winning. That's all that matters to me.'\n\nThe drama was so bad that Strahan left Live! earlier than planned at the network's request, leaving Kelly, 46, to begin the process of finding a new co-host.\n\n'The most disappointing thing to me was that I was painted as the bad guy,' said Strahan.\n\n'I value the way I carry myself,' he said. 'I don't want people to see me as \"Oh, he just ran out, just left them there.\" That's just not true.\n\n'On air all I could do was control myself. In football, New York is the toughest place to play. One day you're the greatest player they've ever seen, then the next game you're the worst.\n\n'But I got older in that business and I said, \"Hey, it doesn't matter what their opinion is. All I know is I'm doing my best, and I'm giving it everything I have.\"'\n\nStrahan also said of his relationship with Ripa: 'At one point I think we were friends. I don't know what happened in the end'.\n\nReading glasses: The pair used their commercial breaks to prep for upcoming segments on that day\n\nExecutives at ABC were apparently less than thrilled with Strahan however after his comments about Ripa in that interview.\n\n'They were livid,' a source told DailyMail.com about the reaction of multiple executives when they read the story.\n\n'Things had finally calmed down and then he goes and does this interview, throwing Ben Sherwood under the bus.'\n\nSherwood, the rpesident of ABC, had just issued a public apology to Ripa and about how the situation was handled just one week prior.\n\nA spokesperson for ABC shot down claims that anyone at the network was 'livid,' pointing out that Strahan's story got its own segment on the program the week that it hit newsstands.\n\nThat segment did not however mention Strahan's comments about Ripa or Live\n\nThe source also said that the team at Good Morning America was also less than thrilled with the Strahan story.\n\n'They think it looks like he came in with his own agenda - which is himself,' said the source.\n\nStrahan was also involved in a feud with former Live co-host Kelly Ripa after he decided to leave the show for GMA\n\n'It is just clear that he is always trying to blame everyone but himself for what happened when in fact he is the one who said on Live two years ago that he would never leave the show and wasn't going anywhere.'\n\nRipa made it clear she was angry with both the network and Strahan when she learned he was leaving the show for Good Morning America on April 19 only an hour before it was publicly announced.\n\nAfter missing four episodes, Ripa held hands with Strahan as she returned to the set on April 26 and joked that the 'long national nightmare' was over.\n\n'I needed a couple days to gather my thoughts,' she told the audience that day.\n\n'After 26 years with this company, I earned the right. Let's be honest, I know half of you called in sick to be here, so we get each other.'\n\nRipa added that 'apologies have been made' and said she was thrilled for Strahan, who was chosen to be Regis Philbin's successor on the show in 2012.\n\nShe has been hosting the show since Strahan's exit with guest hosts including her husband Mark Consuelos, close friends Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen, and Pennsylvania high school teacher Richard Curtis, who won the Live co-hot search.\n\nMegyn Kelly also stopped by the day after the election in a rare early appearance for the primetime news host that came just two months before it was revealed she had signed a new contract with NBC where she will have her own morning show.", "images":
