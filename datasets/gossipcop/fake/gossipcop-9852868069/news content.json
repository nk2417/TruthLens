Trump Jr. was responding to a story Perlman shared in which he remembered urinating on his hands before giving Harvey Weinstein a handshake at a charity event. Trump Jr. called Perlman a \u201ccoward\u201d for staying silent all these years.\n\n\u201cSo you knew he was a rapist and rather the actually do something or say anything you pissed all over your hand?\u201d Trump Jr. asked Perlman on Twitter. \u201cImagine how many assaults on innocent women you could have prevented if you weren\u2019t a coward.\u201d\n\nPerlman\u2019s original tweet detailing the story of his Weinstein handshake never said he knew about the ex-studio head\u2019s predatory behavior. The actor responded to Trump Jr. informing him he never said what Trump Jr. was accusing him of in his question. Perlman proceeded to tell Trump Jr. that the reason he urinated on his hands was because he knew Weinstien was \u201ca prick.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never said I knew Harvey was a rapist,\u201d Perlman wrote to Trump Jr. \u201cI never worked for Harvey\u2026I DID know he was a prick though. A prick and a bully. And I gotta thing about that.\u201d\n\nPerlman has been one of Weinstein\u2019s biggest critics since the first sexual harassment allegations became public last October. The actor used Twitter to celebrate the Academy\u2019s decision to expel Weinstein from its ranks, and he tweeted \u201cMan, if I had an Oscar for every time I almost hit Harvey Weinstein!!\u201d after news broke James Cameron almost hit Weinstein at the Oscars on behalf of Guillermo del Toro. Perlman and del Toro are friends and collaborators, and the director has spoken about clashing with Weinstein during the making of \u201cMimic.\u201d\n\nIn Perlman\u2019s original tweet, the actor shared, \u201cDid I ever tell [you] about when Harvey Weinstein told me to make sure I shook his hand at a charity event? I stopped in the men\u2019s room and pissed all over my hand, then went straight up to him on the receiving line.\u201d\n\nYou can read Perlman and Trump Jr.\u2019s Twitter face off below.\n\nSo you knew he was a rapist and rather the actually do something or say anything you pissed all over your hand??? Imagine how many assaults on innocent women you could have prevented if you weren\u2019t a coward. https://t.co/EvA7bou2bg \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) June 26, 2018", "images": ["https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2218936991_91f763.jpg?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247550030-e1763601506562.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247553612-2.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_9639840c.jpg?w=650", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7155.jpg?w=3000&h=2656&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TNB_05859_R-H-2024-1.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7417.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_9639840c.jpg?w=3000&h=1687&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/anaconda.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2506O02_B5071.jpg?w=3000&h=1687&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/john-and-yoko.jpg?w=770&h=980&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Zack-Sharf.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple_TV_Your_Friends_and_Neighbors_key_art_graphic_header_16_9_show_home.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2246549744.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-01-at-8.32.46\u202fPM.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fear-the-walking-dead-s2-finale-4.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Manfred_MLB.png?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7173.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-Lowdown-Ethan-Hawke-interview.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gangs-of-New-York-Leo.jpg?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_9639840c.jpg?w=650", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zack Sharf"], "canonical_link": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/donald-trump-jr-accuses-ron-perlman-harvey-weinstein-piss-handshake-1201978877/", "title": "Donald Trump Jr. Suggests Ron Perlman Knew About Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Sexual Abuse, Calls Him a \u2018Coward\u2019 For Being Silent", "meta_data": {"description": "Donald Trump Jr. and Ron Perlman faced off on Twitter after the \"Hellboy\" actor admitted to pissing on his hands before shaking Harvey Weinstein's at a charity event.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400654071", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Zack Sharf", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Donald Trump Jr. Suggests Ron Perlman Knew About Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Sexual Abuse, Calls Him a \u2018Coward\u2019 For Being Silent", "url": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/donald-trump-jr-accuses-ron-perlman-harvey-weinstein-piss-handshake-1201978877/", "description": "Donald Trump Jr. and Ron Perlman faced off on Twitter after the \"Hellboy\" actor admitted to pissing on his hands before shaking Harvey Weinstein's at a charity event.", "site_name": "IndieWire", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_9639840c.jpg?w=650", "width": 650, "height": 433, "alt": "Producer Ron Perlman attends a screening of \"To Dust\" at the SVA Theatre during the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival on in New York2018 Tribeca Film Festival - \"To Dust\" Screening, New York, USA - 22 Apr 2018"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-26T19:40:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-26T19:41:38+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Donald Trump Jr. and Ron Perlman faced off on Twitter after the \"Hellboy\" actor admitted to pissing on his hands before shaking Harvey Weinstein's at a charity event.", "site": "@IndieWire", "creator": "@zsharf", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Donald Trump Jr. Suggests Ron Perlman Knew About Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Sexual Abuse, Calls Him a \u2018Coward\u2019 For Being Silent", "image": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/shutterstock_9639840c.jpg?w=650"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-iw_favicon.png?w=270", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530042021.0, "source": "http://www.indiewire.com", "summary": ""}
