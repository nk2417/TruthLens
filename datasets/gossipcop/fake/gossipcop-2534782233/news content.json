Reputation hit the milestone in its first week of release, selling 1.2 million copies.\n\nAll of Swift's six previous studio albums - 1989, Red, Speak Now, Fearless, and Taylor Swift - sold more than two million copies.\n\nHowever, Forbes pointed out that, interestingly, it took significantly longer for Reputation to hit that phenomenal milestone. In fact, longer than Swift's past three albums combined.\n\n2014's 1989 hit 2 million during its third week of release, 2012's Red during its fifth week of release, and 2010's Speak Now during its sixth week. Even 2008's Fearless took only seven weeks to pass 2 million sales.\n\nSwift\u2019s 50-plus-stop stadium tour will commence on 8 May. She recently released the video for her new single \"Delicate\", which imagined the musician gaining the power of invisibility, allowing her a brief sojourn away from her much-tormenting \"reputation\".\n\nFollow Independent Culture on Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and more.", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/30/10/taylor-swift.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/30/10/taylor-swift.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/taylor-swift-reputation-two-million-album-sales-adele-25-ed-sheeran-buy-a8271911.html", "title": "Taylor Swift's Reputation becomes first album to surpass two million in sales since 2015", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/music/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "It's also only one of two albums from last year to sell more than one million copies, Ed Sheeran's \u00f7 being the other", "og": {"updated_time": "2018-03-24T11:57:39.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Taylor Swift's Reputation becomes first album to surpass two million in sales since 2015", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/news/taylor-swift-reputation-two-million-album-sales-adele-25-ed-sheeran-buy-a8271911.html", "type": "article", "description": "It's also only one of two albums from last year to sell more than one million copies, Ed Sheeran's \u00f7 being the other", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/30/10/taylor-swift.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/30/10/taylor-swift.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-24T11:57:39.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-24T11:57:39.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Music", "author_name": "Clarisse Loughrey", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 432, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 4, "external_link_count": 3}, "date": "2018-03-24T11:57:39.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176832122"}, "twitter": {"title": "Taylor Swift's Reputation becomes first album to surpass two million in sales since 2015", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "It's also only one of two albums from last year to sell more than one million copies, Ed Sheeran's \u00f7 being the other", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/30/10/taylor-swift.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Taylor Swift\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521892659.0, "source": "http://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
