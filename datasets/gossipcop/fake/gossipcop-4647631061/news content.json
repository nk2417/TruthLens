The funny thing about a backlash is the way it opens things up and builds momentum on its own. It\u2019s no coincidence that the metaphors we use for a backlash tend to be come from climactic phenomenon \u2014 an opening of the floodgates, a turning of the tide, when it rains it pours. A backlash, though made by human beings, can feel like a part of the natural world and its inexorable forces. And that seems to be what\u2019s happening right now with Taylor Swift.\n\nAnd while there are good things to say about Swift \u2014 her pushing back against streaming services that shaft musicians, for instance \u2014 this tide-turning comes not a moment too soon. I don\u2019t say this because I hate Taylor Swift or because I think she\u2019s talentless. It\u2019s because of the weird consensus that\u2019s shaped up around her in the last year or two: That she\u2019s a brave young woman who\u2019s earned it all herself, that she\u2019s \u201cjust like us,\u201d that she should be lionized for her success at the game of self-branding, that she\u2019s a musical genius, that this scion of a multi-generational banking fortune is \u2014 as the New York Times said of her not long ago \u2014 some kind of \u201cunderdog.\u201d\n\nDespite this weird worship of wealth and power that\u2019s grown up in post-Great Recession America \u2014 which has helped Swift immensely \u2014 not everyone loves Swift or her oddly lifeless, machine-made music. But these critical voices have been marginalized. She\u2019s like the prom queen who drives the brand-new Mercedes to school, whose parents buy everyone cookies: If you defy her you are some kind of envious grouch or killjoy. Our job is simply to obey.\n\nBut the superstar\u2019s Twitter incident with Nicki Minaj \u2014 spurred by MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards snubbing Minaj\u2019s \u201cAnaconda\u201d video \u2014 has opened up a broader discussion about Swift\u2019s privilege and preening and phoniness, and it\u2019s about time. The Guardian has called Swift\u2019s response to Minaj \u2014 she blamed it on men \u2014 \u201cfaux-feminist\u201d and \u201ctone deaf.\u201d The typically sober Atlantic charges Swift with \u201cuses the pretext of female solidarity to try and shut down [Minaj\u2019s] frustration with the music industry.\u201d (Minaj was complaining about the way black musician often get overlooked.)\n\nAnd the press and media \u2014 which has bowed to Swift\u2019s every move \u2014 may be just getting started in this new direction. This is from a substantial new Gawker piece, \u201cTaylor Swift is Not Your Friend,\u201d which documents a lot of over-the-top blather praising her.\n\nIt\u2019s surprising to see smart people talk about Swift with such breathlessly positive overtures, not only because\u2014like pop stars before her and pop stars after her\u2014her music is simple and unfussy and infused with inane platitudes, but also because there appears to be something more opportunistic and sinister at play. When Taylor Swift does the mega-pop stardom act, she does it to the tilt. Swift has to be the person with the prettiest friends, the biggest records, the most popular and successful and groanworthily obvious boyfriend. The underdog narrative that the Swift machine has built is one of forced falsehoods; Swift is not coming from behind. She\u2019s been ahead since she started. And watching her collect best friends during a moment in history when womanhood is finally beginning to feel valued does not only feel uncomfortable\u2014it feels evil.\n\nIt\u2019s also hard not to find the ultraviolent \u201cBad Blood\u201d video a bit, uh, bloodthirsty, especially given that much of her audience is young girls who may not be legally admitted to PG-13 movies. But Dayna Evans\u2019s Gawker piece says the video perfectly illustrates Swift\u2019s ruthlessness and feminist posing. \u201cSwift isn\u2019t here to help women\u2014she\u2019s here to make bank,\u201d she writes. \u201cSeeing her on stage cavorting with World Cup winners and supermodels was not a win for feminism, but a win for Taylor Swift. Her plan\u2014to be as famous and as rich as she can possibly be\u2014is working, and by using other women as tools of her self-promotion, she is distilling feminism for her own benefit.\u201d\n\nSo how far will this go? One thing we\u2019ve learned lately is that Swift has very smart, savvy people working for her. She\u2019s a master of PR, and she could spin this all her way and go back to ordering us mortals to do her laundry and clear her table. But at least for now, we\u2019re enjoying a more honest, wide-ranging conversation about a figure who\u2019s been coddled for far too long.", "images": ["https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2015/07/taylor_swift7.jpg", "https://www.salon.com/app/themes/salon/assets/img/salon-logo.svg", "https://www.salon.com/app/themes/salon/assets/img/salon-placeholder.webp", "https://www.salon.com/app/themes/salon/assets/img/mobile-logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2015/07/taylor_swift7.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Scott Timberg"], "canonical_link": "https://www.salon.com/2015/07/22/the_inevitable_taylor_swift_backlash_begins_watching_the_critical_mad_love_crumble_right_on_schedule/", "title": "The inevitable Taylor Swift backlash begins: Watching the critical mad love crumble, right on schedule", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"pages": 120680396518, "app_id": 134091381200152}, "p": {"domain_verify": "afd252c603232fed8ddf2554b144079b"}, "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The media's bizarre love-fest is finally abating, and not a moment too soon", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.salon.com/2015/07/22/the_inevitable_taylor_swift_backlash_begins_watching_the_critical_mad_love_crumble_right_on_schedule/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ogshare&utm_content=og", "site_name": "Salon.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2015/07/taylor_swift7.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"publisher": 120680396518, "published_time": "2015-07-23T01:15:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-07-23T03:07:48+00:00", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "Twitter", "author": "Scott Timberg"}, "author": "Scott Timberg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Scott Timberg", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "4 minutes"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1437537600.0, "source": "http://www.salon.com", "summary": ""}
