And then she went on to raise what she apparently considers to be the burning question here: Are women who are getting harassed \u2018asking for it'?\"\n\nAfter playing a clip of the comments \u2014 for which Karan has since apologized, telling the Associated Press they are \"not representative of how I feel or what I believe\" \u2014 Kelly turned the focus to her interview with one of Weinstein's accusers, TV journalist Lauren Sivan, who on Monday's episode told Kelly about her \"disgusting\" experience with Weinstein. \"Weirdly, I never thought to ask Lauren whether her skirt brought on that [restuarant] vestibule incident because her outfit is totally irrelevant \u2014 and most rational people know that,\" said Kelly.\n\nQuestioning Karan's statement, Kelly challenged her \"wrong\" thinking: \"There are laws in this country. Laws. I don't give a damn if a woman shows up in a bikini to the office. That doesn't invite or make it okay for her superior to harass her. It makes it okay for her boss to say, \u2018Go home and change.' That's it. The truth is sexual harassment has nothing to do with wardrobe; it has to do with power and control and sexual proclivities that a superior chooses not to reign in. How insulting, by the way, to men, as well? Like they are a bunch of animals who cannot behave themselves if a woman shows part of her thigh, right? This attitude of blaming women for their own harassment is actually one of the reasons women choose not to come forward after they get harassed because they fear victim shaming.\"\n\nKelly continued: \"How about we not pile on, Donna? How about we use this moment to encourage women to find their own voices, despite the risks and to stand up for themselves \u2014 which is hard enough, without rich, powerful, well-connected fashion moguls lecturing them on their fashion choices.\"\n\nThen came Kelly's kicker: \"And speaking of fashion choices, here's one for you: I'm done with Donna Karan.\"\n\nDespite her dismissive message, Kelly invited Karan on the show for \"an honest discussion about how [Karan] really feels,\" adding, \"If she's really sorry, if she really was taken out of context, if she really doesn't believe that way, explain those comments.\"\n\nWith her comments Tuesday, Kelly joined a growing list of celebrities speaking out against Weinstein, whose scandal erupted following an Oct. 5 New York Times expos\u00e9 alleging the movie mogul has been sexually harassing women for three decades. Weinstein has since been fired by The Weinstein Company and apologized for \"the way I've behaved with colleagues in the past\" in a statement to the Times. On Tuesday, a report posted by the New Yorker alleged more sexual misconduct claims, including assault, against Weinstein, which he also denied.\n\nWatch Kelly's segment in the video above.
