That\u2019s what one tabloid is reporting, but this was more than likely a false rumor.\n\nThe gossip magazine, Star, reported that the Sons of Anarchy alum caused a scene and was even booed by other passengers. A person, who is called a \u201cspy\u201d by the tabloid, claimed to be at the airport during the incident.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\n\u201cThe lines were huge, and people had been waiting for well over an hour, but Charlie was in and out of there at warp speed.

According to Gossip Cop, the report is entirely fabricated.\n\nA source told Gossip Cop that this alleged incident \u201cnever happened.\u201d\n\nWhen the British actor isn\u2019t the subject of seemingly fake news stories, he is gushing over his longtime girlfriend, Morgana McNelis.\n\nWhile attending the Toronto International Film Festival to promote his new film, Papillon, Hunnam explained how he and McNelis have maintained their romance for more than a decade.\n\n\u201cI try to keep the romance on the reg,\u2019\u201d he told PEOPLE magazine. \u201cI\u2019ve been with my girlfriend 11 years, and as anyone knows, it\u2019s been a long-term, fully monogamous relationship that requires work, a lot of work.\u201d\n\nHunnam says that working on his relationship with McNelis doesn\u2019t always require grand romantic gestures.\n\n\u201cBefore I came away to TIFF I ended up staying until 5 in the morning because I decided I was going to clean the entire house,\u201d he said.", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/boston-blue-faith-and-family-sonequa-martin-green-donnie-wahlberg-cbs.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "http://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/04/70839b1d-3826-4242-9848-ca2fff9b687f.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/04/45511bc5-8791-4d0b-a2e9-34e9c9011b24.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/70afec6a-3143-4947-b047-428e525611d4.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hunter Miller", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/charlie-hunnam-airport-booed-cutting-line/", "title": "Was Charlie Hunnam Booed for Cutting Airport Line?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Was Charlie Hunnam Booed for Cutting Airport Line?", "description": "Did Charlie Hunnam really get booed at the airport by other travelers when using his celebrity status to cut the long immigration line?
