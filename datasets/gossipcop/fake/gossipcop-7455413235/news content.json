I love embracing my curves no matter what size I am.\u2019\n\nKhloe covers her body completely sparking more rumours (Picture: Splash News)\n\nIf the rumours are true, Khloe and her NBA star boyfriend, who have dated for one year, will be expecting their first child together.\n\nFans are clearly eager to know what\u2019s going on, as they have been flooding Khloe\u2019s Instagram every time she posts a picture, convinced they can see a \u2018baby bump\u2019\n\nKhloe is reportedly pregnant with Tristan Thompson\u2019s child (Picture: Splash News)\n\nThe family\u2019s radio silence suggest there will be a big announcement (Picture: Splash News)\n\nThe Instagram picture showed Khloe in a revealing leather black dress and among the comments praising Khloe for her look were many who believed the picture showed a hint of baby bump.\n\n\u2018Aw look at her little baby bump! (sic),\u2019 wrote one fan while another asked: \u2018Is that baby bump or I\u2019m just trippin?\u2019 Another thought for sure that they could \u2018see that bump\u2019.\n\nIt was suggested that the uncharacteristic radio silence from the family suggests that there may be plans in the works for some kind of headline-stealing joint pregnancy reveal from the sisters; sister Kim has already confirmed she is expecting her third child, via a surrogate, in a teaser clip for the upcoming 14th season of their hit show Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nKim and Khloe\u2019s younger half-sister Kylie Jenner is also reportedly pregnant, due in January with boyfriend Travis Scott\u2019s baby.\n\nKim (L) is expecting her third child via a surrogate pregnancy (Picture: Backgrid)\n\nAlthough Kylie is keeping mum, it has also been claimed that the 20-year-old has hired a whole squad ahead of her rumoured child\u2019s arrival, including a pregnancy coach to help her make sure she\u2019s eating right and staying healthy, but also a whole new team to help expand her empire.\n\nThe Kardashian could soon be expanding (Picture: BACKGRID)\n\nThis is in addition to extra security, according to Radar Online. \u2018Kylie hired a pregnancy coach too, who will help her with nutrition and exercise, as well as take her through Lamaze training when she gets further along,\u2019 an insider said.\n\n\u2018Kylie is definitely not taking any chances when it comes to her unborn baby!\u2019\n\nArrow MORE: The Kardashian baby boom: Everything you need to know about the
