Production on the $50 million film, which wrapped this summer in advance of an April 6 release, was moved to Georgia to take advantage of a generous tax credit.\n\nThen the studio played hardball with the actors, who have experienced mixed levels of success outside of the franchise.\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood\u2019s 10 Highest-Grossing Actors\n\nAccording to sources, Universal is paying Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott a robust $5 million each, plus a small slice of first-dollar gross, to reprise their roles.\n\nAlyson Hannigan, star of CBS\u2019 How I Met Your Mother, is getting about $3 million. And veteran Eugene Levy, who starred in four profitable direct-to-DVD Pie films that helped make the property a billion-dollar franchise, is said to have received a payday also in the $3 million range.\n\nPHOTOS: \u2018How I Met Your Mother\u2019 and Fall TV\u2019s Other Returning Shows\n\nThe rest of the cast \u2014 which includes Chris Klein, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Thomas Ian Nicholas, Natasha Lyonne, Jennifer Coolidge, Mena Suvari and Shannon Elizabeth \u2014 is being paid far less, say sources, most in the $500,000 to $750,000 range (though bonuses for some could kick in if the film is a hit, as expected).\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood\u2019s 10 Highest-Paid Actresses\n\nRounding out the list is Tara Reid, who is said to have joined Reunion for close to the $250,000 that Universal initially offered. A studio rep calls the figures \u201cinaccurate\u201d but declines further comment.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pie_a.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pie_a.jpg?w=2000&h=1126&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pie_a.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matthew Belloni", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/american-pie-reunion-salaries-242160/", "title": "Who Got Paid What for the \u2018American Pie\u2019 Reunion", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott commanded robust salaries while Mena Suvari, Tara Reid and others received millions less from Universal.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Matthew Belloni", "tags": "American Pie, American Reunion, Eugene Levy, Jason Biggs, Seann William Scott", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Who Got Paid What for the \u2018American Pie\u2019 Reunion", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/american-pie-reunion-salaries-242160/", "description": "Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott commanded robust salaries while Mena Suvari, Tara Reid and others received millions less from Universal.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pie_a.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Who Got Paid What the 'American Pie' Reunion"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2011-09-29T16:36:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-29T06:45:37+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jason Biggs and Seann William Scott commanded robust salaries while Mena Suvari, Tara Reid and others received millions less from Universal.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Who Got Paid What for the \u2018American Pie\u2019 Reunion", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/pie_a.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1317314160.0, "source": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
