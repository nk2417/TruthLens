I don\u2019t think mine\u2019s particularly exceptional apart from that we\u2019re both in the public eye.\n\n\u2018But I never thought I would get married. It was not an ambition of mine. It was the opposite.\u2019\n\nThe Brit added: \u2018I couldn\u2019t relate to romantic comedies \u2014 marriage seems to be the whole point of them. Then it just happened, happily, at a more mature moment.\u2019\n\nThe Mercy hits cinemas on 9 February.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
