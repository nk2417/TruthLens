Then he pivoted to riskier territory \u2013 Hollywood\u2019s recent flood of sexual harassment allegations.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice a very disturbing pattern emerging, which is that many of the predators are Jews,\u201d said David, whose Curb Your Enthusiasm once included a plot about mistaking Survivor cast members with camp survivors, said. \u201cI don\u2019t like it when Jews are in the news for notorious reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know I consistently strive to be a good Jewish representative,\u201d David said after a crude joke about Harvey Weinstein. \u201cWhen people see me, I want them to say, \u2018Oh, there goes a fine Jew.\u2019\u201d\n\nThen he dove in head first.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been obsessed with women and often wondered, if I\u2019d grown up in Poland when Hitler came to power, and was sent to a concentration camp, would I still be checking out women in the camp? I think I would.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey Shlomo, look at the one by barracks 8,\u201d David continued. \u201cOh my God, is she gorgeous?!\u2026 I\u2019d like to go up and say something to her.\n\n\u201cOf course, the problem is there are no good opening lines in a concentration camp: \u2018How\u2019s it going? They treating you OK? You know, if we ever get out of here, I\u2019d like to take you out for some latkes.\u201d", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/david-snl.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/david-snl.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Greg Evans", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2017/11/larry-david-snl-monologue-concentration-camps-reaction-1202202297/", "title": "Anti-Defamation League Blasts Larry David\u2019s Concentration Camp \u2018SNL\u2019 Jokes: \u201cOffensive, Insensitive & Unfunny\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The Anti-Defamation League says Larry David's Saturday Night Live monologue - in which the Curb Your Enthusiasm creator pondered his dating options in a concentration camp - was \"offensive, insensitive &amp; unfunny all at same time.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Greg Evans", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Anti-Defamation League Blasts Larry David\u2019s Concentration Camp \u2018SNL\u2019 Jokes: \u201cOffensive, Insensitive & Unfunny\u201d", "url": "https://deadline.com/2017/11/larry-david-snl-monologue-concentration-camps-reaction-1202202297/", "description": "The Anti-Defamation League says Larry David\u2018s Saturday Night Live monologue \u2013 in which the Curb Your Enthusiasm creator pondered his dating options in a concentration camp \u2013 was \u201coffensive, insensitive & unfunny all at same time.\u201d The ADL\u2019s stance, tweeted by the organization\u2019s CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, was in line with plenty of Twitterers who started [\u2026]", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/david-snl.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 559, "alt": "Anti-Defamation League Blasts Larry David's 'SNL' Monologue"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-05T18:45:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-05T19:51:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Anti-Defamation League says Larry David\u2018s Saturday Night Live monologue \u2013 in which the Curb Your Enthusiasm creator pondered his dating options in a concentration camp \u2013 was \u201coffensive, insensitive & unfunny all at same time.\u201d The ADL\u2019s stance, tweeted by the organization\u2019s CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, was in line with plenty of Twitterers who started [\u2026]", "site": "@Deadline", "creator": "@GregEvans5", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Anti-Defamation League Blasts Larry David\u2019s Concentration Camp \u2018SNL\u2019 Jokes: \u201cOffensive, Insensitive & Unfunny\u201d", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/david-snl.jpg?w=1024"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509907548.0, "source": "http://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
