Three days later, the lovebirds emerged once again at Santa Monica\u2019s decidedly more-low key Jack in the Box drive-thru. With fries and a cheeseburger in hand, the all-smiles duo sped off in his Range Rover. According to a witness, \u201cThey looked so happy together.\u201d\n\nSomething was off, however. The passenger was not his love of more than a year, Lindsay Shookus \u2014 but 22-year-old Playboy model Shauna Sexton. Not only had Affleck, 46, and the Saturday Night Live producer, 38, quietly split \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s amicable,\u201d says a source \u2014 in just two weeks, the actor had also reverted back to his womanizing ways. It\u2019s a behavior his estranged wife, Jennifer Garner, knows all too well. While still with Garner, Affleck began secretly dating Shookus. And just weeks after the parents of Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6, announced the end of their decade-long marriage, Affleck moved on with their then 28-year-old nanny, Christine Ouzounian.\n\n\u201cJen realized a long time ago that she cannot fix Ben and that his problems are not hers to solve,\u201d a Garner confidant reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly. \u201cShe\u2019s not his babysitter. She just wants to protect the kids. But she does wish Ben would keep his life more private.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Splits 2018 Calling it quits.

(After photos of them hit the internet, Shookus deleted her Instagram account.) Evenings out aside, Affleck and Playboy\u2019s Miss May 2018 have clocked plenty of hours holed up in his $20 million, seven-bedroom Pacific Palisades bachelor pad, says an insider \u2014 much to the dismay of Garner.\n\nRelated: Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner: The Way They Were Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner announced their split after 10 years of marriage on June 30, 2015. From their first public outing, to welcoming daughters Violet and Seraphina, and son Samuel, look back at the way they were.\n\n\u201cOf course she\u2019s not pleased he\u2019s dating a 22-year-old Playboy model,\u201d says the Garner confidant. \u201cBut she\u2019s also not surprised. Jen has come to expect this from Ben. She\u2019s not going to get involved. She can\u2019t make decisions for him.\u201d\n\nFor more on Garner and Affleck, pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly, on newsstands now!", "images":
