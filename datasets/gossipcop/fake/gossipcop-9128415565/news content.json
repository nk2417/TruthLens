This week\u2019s Star magazine in the US features the news that Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are \u2018back together\u2019 with the help of George Clooney \u2013 seemingly confirming New Idea\u2019s exclusive report last week that he had engineered the couple\u2019s reunion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Star, when Angelina Jolie left Brad\u2019s life, party-loving George was excited to return, having allegedly been shunted out of the actor\u2019s life by a disapproving Ange. And he reportedly relished the opportunity to facilitate a thawing between Brad and his ex-wife Jen.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ve been secretly getting together for late night hook ups, and it\u2019s all because of George,\u2019 a source told Star.\n\n\u2018George was the first person to call him when his marriage to Angie imploded. After Jen and Justin Theroux announced their split, he encouraged Brad to reach out and give their relationship another chance.\u2019\n\nThe magazine cover that all of America is talking about today (Credit: Star magazine)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the magazine, the duo had their first post-slip meet up an March 3 at a private pre-Oscars party in Beverly Hills.\n\n\u2018The plan was to head over to Jen\u2019s place afterward for a nightcap, but, of course, George would just drop Brad off.\u2019\n\nThe magazine claims that Jen was so excited by the idea, that she even went to the extreme of lending George her bodyguard so he could drive the pair to her home.\n\n\u2018Their evening together was very relaxed and low-key,\u2019 the source told Star. \u2018They reminisced about the past and had a lot of laughs. It seems just like old times, only better.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Star notes that George Clooney\u2019s rep had denied their story, the magazine goes on to note that Jennifer \u2018wants to keep the reunion under the radar\u2019, given that she only announced her marriage split weeks ago.\n\nNeither Brad nor Jen\u2019s reps have yet commented on Star\u2019s story.", "images": ["https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/chrissie-swan-the-shortcut-queen-691e509abfe28.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-20t164344.876-691eaa9997406.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-18t103613.659-691bb21f4c9ec.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/71038/michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-hollywood.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/Logo-1.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/131095/untitled-design-2023-11-08t103411331.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/icon-phosphor-circle.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-19t145321.000-691d3f406e345.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/07/NIFLOGO_Organge.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/gettyimages-2156373625-691bc2c3a0fcf-scaled.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/121578/untitled-design-4.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/ni2546pm1_marketing-cover_v0.1-691a9098143bf-scaled.jpg?resize=1955%2C2560", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/air-fryer-1-691eadfe53bed.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?d=mm&s=128", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/24790/jent.png?resize=762%2C1023", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-19t134714.374-691d2fbe0f750.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/07/wordpress-featured-image-template-11-6863926196e99.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-19t162531.737-691d54db7671a.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-18t112445.554-691bbcd84c0f3.png?resize=380%2C285"], "top_img": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Audrey Goddard", "Loves To Write", "To Share", "Opinion -
