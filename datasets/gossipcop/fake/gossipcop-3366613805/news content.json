You are the last person to know about it. So everyone phones you and could be phoning your family. The weirdest is when people text you saying, \u2018Dude, are you dead?\u2019. I'm always like: 'what do you think I\u2019m going to [reply]? Sometimes I just don\u2019t reply,\u201d he added.\n\nHouston News reported in July that Trevor died following a shooting incident at Orlando. The web publication said Trevor was shot while greeting fans after a concert.\n\nTrevor was reportedly also \"killed\" in March after being involved in an alleged \"car accident\".", "images": ["https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/arenaholdings-sandbox/1733820208740.svg", "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/TV355FINWJBZ5JXINNMKSYQ7K4.png?smart=true&auth=e34c41f23e6d88c47ffd2fe6157300784abfe60cff10be6228c9b93a8adfadc1&width=274&height=182", "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/L2KC772PSJJOJLUSFXDTFZWX4Q.jpg?smart=true&auth=dae61b95d0e24b56ccfadd4576ecaaa740feb8da190e87853385f86790c1fc4c&width=274&height=182", "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/YGD44AHGR5NU7LZMSXHW7QTEZQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=c3f4b0e745dbb8663e4256294d68bc6d32094db0026f98461ed85fb3427160a3&width=274&height=182", "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/SEFTHOBTSVETDLP5VDDTFPRT4U.jpeg?smart=true&auth=e028fd93de64b65aeec99039f7896e9d4c3f378f62fbd20e61b85391e316084c&width=274&height=182", "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/SJAPDHYBTNOZREMVYKKSD2W4KY.jpg?smart=true&auth=0261b20417049de5280cd825be36b320111c14bfca80ee7a1ee877355c25f9ac&width=1200&height=630", "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/SJAPDHYBTNOZREMVYKKSD2W4KY.jpg?auth=0261b20417049de5280cd825be36b320111c14bfca80ee7a1ee877355c25f9ac&width=800&height=533&smart=true", "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/AKUPTS46LVKCLGO44XBBJUNWQE.jpg?smart=true&auth=7f86f919e0c7796bcf08c000312eba28699ea7316cf0a8eb9652bbcf8c9b887c&width=274&height=182"], "top_img": "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/SJAPDHYBTNOZREMVYKKSD2W4KY.jpg?smart=true&auth=0261b20417049de5280cd825be36b320111c14bfca80ee7a1ee877355c25f9ac&width=1200&height=630", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.timeslive.co.za/tshisa-live/tshisa-live/2017-09-08-watch-im-always-the-last-to-hear-about-it-says-trevor-noah-on-fake-death-hoax/", "title": "WATCH: 'I'm always the last to hear about it, says Trevor Noah on fake death hoax", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "description": "Comedian Trevor Noah has laughed off the constant influx of fake reports claiming he had died, explaining how he was always the last to know of his \"death\".", "twitter": {"description": "Comedian Trevor Noah has laughed off the constant influx of fake reports claiming he had died, explaining how he was always the last to know of his \"death\".", "title": "WATCH: 'I'm always the last to hear about it, says Trevor Noah on fake death hoax", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/SJAPDHYBTNOZREMVYKKSD2W4KY.jpg?smart=true&auth=0261b20417049de5280cd825be36b320111c14bfca80ee7a1ee877355c25f9ac&width=1200&height=630", "alt": "Trevor Noah has been host of 'The Daily Show' for seven years."}, "site": "@TimesLIVE", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"description": "Comedian Trevor Noah has laughed off the constant influx of fake reports claiming he had died, explaining how he was always the last to know of his \"death\".", "title": "WATCH: 'I'm always the last to hear about it, says Trevor Noah on fake death hoax", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.timeslive.co.za/resizer/v2/SJAPDHYBTNOZREMVYKKSD2W4KY.jpg?smart=true&auth=0261b20417049de5280cd825be36b320111c14bfca80ee7a1ee877355c25f9ac&width=1200&height=630", "alt": "Trevor Noah has been host of 'The Daily Show' for seven years."}, "type": "article", "site_name": "TimesLIVE", "url": "https://www.timeslive.co.za/tshisa-live/tshisa-live/2017-09-08-watch-im-always-the-last-to-hear-about-it-says-trevor-noah-on-fake-death-hoax/"}, "keywords": "trevor noah,dead", "robots": "noarchive"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/OLxDnnTpgA0?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1504843200.0, "source": "http://www.timeslive.co.za", "summary": ""}
