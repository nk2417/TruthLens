Osborne served as the face of TCM since its launch in 1994; the longtime industry columnist also authored many books on the history of the Oscars, including 1965\u2019s Academy Awards Illustrated and The Official History of the Academy Awards.\n\n\n\nLongtime friend Liza Minnelli said in a statement to Deadline:\n\n\u201cIt was evident to anybody who watched Robert Osborne on Turner Classic Movies that his knowledge about Hollywood and film was second to none. He was an indispensable guide to viewers who tuned in everyday to hear his thoughts. Often, if I couldn\u2019t remember the name of an actor or a particular film, I\u2019d ring him up and he\u2019d instantly know the answer.\u201d\n\nTCM shared a touching video with Osborne\u2019s friends and colleagues; industry figures including Cher, Patton Oswalt, Patricia Arquette, Gilbert Gottfried, and others expressed their grief on social media. Watch the video here:\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nToday we say good-bye to a dear member of our TCM family.
