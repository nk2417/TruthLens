We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n\nName a more glamorous and solid Hollywood couple than Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds\u2014we\u2019ll wait.\n\nThe two first met on the set of 2011\u2019s Green Lantern, and realized their love for one another during a double date sometime later. The friendship turned romance quickly led to marriage, and over a decade later, the couple is raising four children.\n\nBelow, look back at Lively and Reynolds\u2019s complete relationship timeline\u2014from their superheroic costarring gig onward.\n\nDecember 13, 2024: Ryan gives rare insight on parenting his kids with Blake.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the Deadpool star opens up about how he and Lively approach parenting to their four kids: James, Inez, Betty, and Olin.\n\n\u201cWe try to give them as normal a life as possible. I try not to impose upon them the difference in their childhood to my childhood or my wife\u2019s childhood,\u201d he tells the outlet. \u201cWe both grew up very working class, and I remember when they were very young, I used to say or think, like, \u2018Oh God, I would never have had a gift like this when I was a kid,\u2019 or, \u2018I never would\u2019ve had this luxury of getting takeout,\u2019 or whatever.\u201d\n\nHe continues, \u201cThen I realized that that\u2019s not really their bag of rocks to carry. They\u2019re already very much in touch with gratitude and understanding the world enough to have a strong sense of empathy. Those are the things that I would think [would indicate] we\u2019re doing an OK job \u2014 if our kids can empathize with other people and other kids. But yes, it\u2019s different. When I was a kid, you would just suck it up, get out of the house and be back by sundown, which I just can\u2019t even imagine now.\u201d\n\nLively and Reynolds join their longtime friend Taylor Swift, as well as her beau Travis Kelce, for dinner at The Corner Store in New York City.\n\nLively, who famously styles herself , wears a sheer maroon dress with cutouts and thigh-high slits on each side, revealing the matching fishnet tights she wears underneath. She styles her look with pair of purple Valentino Soul Rockstud boots, a multicolor quilted bag, and an avant-garde silver choker. For the occasion, she wears her blonde hair in bouncy waves, pulling her hair to one side for an added dramatic effect.\n\nXNY/Star Max\n\nReynolds, for his part, wears a white button-up shirt from Bode. His top features a contrasting yellow trim, as well as a navy collar embellished with yellow stars, and he styles the shirt with a pair of matching blue trousers. On foot, he wears striped white-and-navy socks and a pair of tan suede dress shoes. Reynolds clasps his wife\u2019s hand as they enter the restaurant, and perhaps in a nod to Swift, he finishes off his look with a handful of beaded bracelets.\n\nAugust 6, 2024: They look incredible at a NY premiere.\n\nThe couple\u2014who robbed us of our annual dose of Blake-and-Ryan-red-carpet PDA by not attending this year\u2019s Met Gala\u2014finally give us what we want at the New York premiere of It Ends With Us.\n\nLively looks incredible in a vintage Versace gown: a shimmery rainbow piece. And Reynolds looks dashing in a light gray suit and white top adorned with a baby pink rose in his pocket square.\n\nGotham // Getty Images\n\nOn the carpet, the couple looks in love as ever.\n\nJuly 22, 2024: Ryan reveals the name of his and Blake\u2019s fourth child.\n\nGotham // Getty Images\n\nFor a year and a half, Lively and Reynolds keep the name of their fourth child a secret\u2014until Reynolds ends up spilling the beans when he thanks his family at the New York City premiere of Deadpool & Wolverine.\n\nOn the red carpet, Reynolds shows his love for Lively, as well as daughters James, nine, Inez, seven, Betty, four, and their fourth child, whose name is revealed to be Olin.\n\nAccording to the Bump, the name Olin is of Nordic origin, and means \u201cancestor\u2019s heir\u201d or \u201cto inherit.\u201d While the moniker is typically used for boys, Lively and Reynolds have yet to reveal the gender of their youngest. (And as evidenced by their eldest\u2019s name, they aren\u2019t afraid to challenge conventions.)\n\nThe entire family attends the premiere event, where Reynolds thanks them with a characteristically funny speech. \u201cI hope that, if I\u2019m lucky, this moment will be the most traumatic thing\u2014that is, the contents of this movie\u2014that happens in your wondrous lives,\u201d he says.\n\nJuly 21, 2024: Ryan says he wants all the kids with Blake.\n\nIn an interview with E! News, the Deadpool & Wolverine star admits that he\u2019ll take all the kids he can get with Lively. \u201cThe more the merrier,\u201d he says. \u201cAs many as possible. As many little heartbeats as possible, just running around, wrecking stuff in the house. I love it. Let\u2019s have more!\u201d\n\nThe two are already parents to daughters James, nine, Inez, seven, and Betty, four, as well as a fourth child born in 2023.\n\n\n\nMay 13, 2024: Ryan jokes about the name of their fourth baby.\n\nDuring an appearance on the Today show, the IF star is asked by hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb about the name of his and Lively\u2019s fourth child, whom the couple recently welcomed. \u201cTaylor Swift keeps dropping [their names] into lyrics!\u201d Guthrie said, referring the pop star\u2019s song \u201cBetty,\u201d from 2020, in which she includes the names of Lively and Reynolds\u2019 three daughters: Inez, James, and course, Betty.\n\nAfter Guthrie asks Reynolds whether the fourth baby\u2019s name is anywhere on Swift\u2019s new album, The Tortured Poets Department, he jokes, \u201cWe always wait for Taylor to tell us what the child\u2019s name is \u2026 and I will say this: We\u2019re still waiting.\u201d He does not end up revealing the name.\n\nDustin Satloff // Getty Images\n\nApril 19, 2023: They coordinate street-style looks.\n\nWhile out in New York City, Lively and Reynolds dress in matching beige-and-blue outfits.

Everybody\u2019s actually doing fantastic.

And it was just one of those moments where halfway through the dance, it was like, \u2018Oh, I think I just crossed a line.\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cAnd then I walked her home. And, uh, you know, I don\u2019t really need to go into what happened after that.\u201d\n\nApril 14, 2016: Blake and Ryan are expecting again.\n\nUs Weekly confirms Lively is pregnant with their second child, daughter Inez, who will be born in September.\n\nOctober 6, 2014: Blake is pregnant.\n\nIt is confirmed that Lively and Reynolds are expecting their first child together, daughter James, who will be born in December.\n\nJuly 18, 2014: Blake boasts about Ryan.\n\nLively expresses her contentment with Reynolds as both a husband and soon-to-be father in a new interview. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be a great father and leader and patriarch\u2014he\u2019s so meant to be all of those things.

In a 2014 interview, she shares, \u201cLater, my dress was hanging up and Ryan said, \u2018Isn\u2019t that beautiful?\u2019 I said, \u2018What?\u2019 And he pointed to the burn. My heart just stopped, because it was such a sensitive little subject. And he said, \u2018You\u2019ll always remember that moment with Florence singing and the sparklers. You have that forever, right there, preserved.\u2019 Now that\u2019s my favorite part of the dress.\u201d\n\nLively and Reynolds, now split from their previous significant others, meet up again for a double date\u2014though with different partners. Reynolds later jokes on SiriusXM\u2019s Entertainment Weekly Radio that it was \u201cthe most awkward date\u201d for the people they were with, because \u201cfireworks\u201d were going on between him and Lively.\n\nThey begin going on casual dates\u2014without anyone else\u2014after that, and the rest is history.\n\n\u201cNext thing you know, she was going to Boston, I was going to Boston, and I said, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll ride with you.\u2019 We got on the train and rode together,\u201d Reynolds tells SmartLess cohost Jason Bateman in July 2021. He adds jokingly, \u201cI was just begging her to sleep with me.\u201d\n\nHe continues: \u201cA week later, I was like, \u2018We should buy a house together.\u2019 And we did.\u201d\n\nJuly 2010: They meet on the set of Green Lantern.\n\nLively and Reynolds first meet as costars\u2014whose characters are romantic interests\u2014in the DC Comics film. \u201cI met Blake on the darkest crease in the anus of the universe called Green Lantern,\u201d he says on an episode of the SmartLess podcast 11 years later. (The 2011 superhero movie was famously a bomb, and Reynolds would lampoon its failure a few years later, in the much more successful Deadpool.)\n\nNothing happens between the two, as the they are both with other people at the time\u2014Lively with Gossip Girl costar Penn Badgley, and Reynolds with then-wife Scarlett Johansson\u2014but they do become \u201cbuddies,\u201d according to the actor.",
