{"url": "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despacito", "text": "2017 single by Luis Fonsi featuring Daddy Yankee\n\nNot to be confused with Despacio\n\n\"Despacito\" (Latin American Spanish: [despa\u02c8sito]; transl. \"Slowly\") is a song by Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi, originally written in 2015. In 2016, Luis sent the song to Puerto Rican rapper and singer Daddy Yankee to give it an \"urban injection\", and released it as the lead single from Fonsi's 2019 studio album Vida.[1][2]\n\nReleased on January 13, 2017, the song was written by Fonsi, Erika Ender, and Daddy Yankee, and produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andr\u00e9s Torres.[1] A remix version featuring Canadian singer Justin Bieber was released on April 17, 2017, which helped to improve the chart performance of the song in numerous countries, including various number-one positions. \"Despacito\" has been widely credited by music journalists as being instrumental in the renewed popularity of Spanish-language pop music in the mainstream market.\n\nIt is a reggaeton and Latin pop song composed in common time with lyrics about desiring a sexual relationship, performed in a smooth and romantic way. \"Despacito\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the fusion between Latin and urban rhythms, its catchiness, and its text painting. It has received Latin Grammy Awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Urban Fusion/Performance, and Best Short Form Music Video at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards. \"Despacito\" has been also ranked among the best Latin songs of all time and the best songs of 2017 by various publications, which referred to it as one of the most successful Spanish-language tracks in pop-music history.\n\nThe song topped the charts of 47 countries and reached the top 10 of six others. In the United States, it became the first song primarily in Spanish to top the Billboard Hot 100 since Los del R\u00edo's \"Macarena\" in 1996, subsequently tying the longest-reigning number one on the Billboard Hot 100 at the time with 16 weeks, as well as becoming the longest-running number-one on the Hot Latin Songs chart with 56 weeks. It also became the first Latin song to receive a diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. The music video shows both artists performing the song in La Perla neighborhood of Old San Juan, Puerto Rico and local bar La Factor\u00eda. It was the most-viewed YouTube video of all time from August 2017 to November 2020 when it was overtaken by Pinkfong's Baby Shark, and became the first video on the site to reach the milestones of three, four, five, six, seven, and eight billion views.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nOriginal version [ edit ]\n\nPanamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender (pictured) co-wrote the song.\n\nThe lyrics of \"Despacito\" were written in late 2015 in Luis Fonsi's house in Miami because he wanted to record a \"swinging song\" for his new album after two years without releasing new music.[3][4] He woke up mulling about \"a song called 'Despacito'\" and invited Brazilian-Panamanian singer and songwriter Erika Ender to a songwriting session.[5] Fonsi co-wrote the song on a Gibson Emmylou Harris guitar.[6] He originally composed it as a cumbia and pop song with lyrics written as a ballad, but decided to give it an \"urban injection\" and sent a demo to reggaeton artist Daddy Yankee.[4] They recorded the song at Noisematch Studios in Miami in late 2016.[7][8] Daddy Yankee improvised his verse in a corner of the studio's control room while thinking about his father playing bongos and wrote the post-chorus.[8][9] It was produced by Mauricio Rengifo and Andr\u00e9s Torres; the former is known as a member of Colombian pop duo Cali y El Dandee and the latter is known for previously working with David Bisbal, Thal\u00eda, and Ricky Martin.[10][11] It was mixed by American engineer Jaycen Joshua at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles.[12]\n\nLuis Fonsi does not consider it a reggaeton song, but feels, \"it does have a reggaeton energy and an subtle urban beat\".[4] Ender stated that the track \"went through several arrangements\" until Fonsi got \"exactly the arrangement he wanted\".[5] Fonsi described \"Despacito\" as a very melodic song that can adapt well to many other music genres.[13] Due to the sensual nature of the song, they \"needed to be responsible with a good lyric\" and Ender's approach to writing for Fonsi was \"to take care of how to say things with a good taste\".[3] In April 2017, American singer and songwriter Nicky Jam revealed that the original version of \"Despacito\" featured him instead of Daddy Yankee, but had to decline due to the song's release interfering with the launch of his album F\u00e9nix.[14]\n\nJustin Bieber remix [ edit ]\n\nThree months after the release of \"Despacito\", Canadian singer Justin Bieber wanted to record a remix version after hearing the song in a Colombian nightclub during a tour in South America.[15] The following day, Fonsi received a phone call from Universal Latin about the intentions for remix and authorized the label to send the track to Bieber.[16] Bieber's manager, Scooter Braun, contacted his vocal producer Josh Gudwin to work on the song, who flew to Bogot\u00e1 and recorded Justin Bieber's vocals at Estudios Audiovisi\u00f3n.[17]\n\nBieber sang in Spanish for the first time in his career with the help of Colombian musician Juan Felipe Samper.[18][19] What was most difficult for Justin Bieber was the 'ere' (\u027e) sound in words like \"laberinto\" (labyrinth), \"paredes\" (walls) and \"manuscrito\" (manuscript).[19] Samper wrote the Spanish-language lyrics phonetically to ease Bieber's pronunciation, which was \"perfectly\" achieved in two hours.[19] After a four-hour recording session, Gudwin sent Bieber's vocal tracks to Australian sound engineer Chris O'Ryan for vocal tuning.[17] Gudwin concluded the remix's production in Parrot Cay, Turks and Caicos Islands with the mixing of Luis Fonsi's English-language vocals, whose lyrics were written by American songwriter Marty James.[17] The entire process until the release date took six days.[17] In June 2017, English musician Ed Sheeran revealed that he wanted to record a remix version of the song, but lost out to Justin Bieber.[20]\n\nComposition [ edit ]\n\n\"Despacito\" is a reggaeton and Latin pop song composed in common time (4\n\n4 time) with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds and written in the key of B minor[21] with a tempo of 89 beats per minute and a common chord progression of Bm\u2014G\u2014D\u2014A.[22][23][24] The vocals span from F\u266f 3 to B 4 .[25] Its implicit lyrics are about having a sexual relationship in a smooth and romantic way, making heavy use of allegories.[26] However, Luis Fonsi expressed that some lines are free for interpretation.[27]\n\n\"Despacito\" (original version) sample Partial bridge and partial chorus of \"Despacito\" Problems playing this file? See media help.\n\nMauricio Rengifo and Andr\u00e9s Torres produced \"Despacito\" using Pro Tools and the final mix consisted of 47 tracks.[28] The song begins with a Puerto Rican cuatro played by Christian Nieves, which is accompanied by an acoustic guitar played by Torres when Luis Fonsi starts performing.[28] Rengifo stated that the guitar \"was actually played, but then [they] chopped it and made it really digital.\"[28] The producers decided to record a cuatro because they wanted \"to feel very Puerto Rican and ethnic\" and that it \"gives the song a really unique character\".[28] Nieves played salsa-influenced melodies during the chorus and the hook, which contains \"old school pop\" effects based on American producer Dr. Luke.[28] Percussion instruments guache and g\u00fcira were synchronized with a hi hat in order to highlight the track's cumbia influences.[28]\n\nThe song uses the side-chaining production technique in order to make the chorus \"more prominent\", silencing the music as the kick drum hits.[29] It also makes heavy use of text painting when the music is slowed down as the word \"despacito\" (slowly) is performed at the beginning of every chorus.[29] Its percussion consists of guache, cowbell, timbales, g\u00fcira, and sequenced drum patterns.[28] The remix featuring Justin Bieber maintained the original rhythms and Luis Fonsi translated some lines to English, singing a verse in Spanglish, while Daddy Yankee's verses were kept from the original version.[18]\n\nRelease and reception [ edit ]\n\n\"Despacito\" was made available for digital download on January 13, 2017, by Universal Music Latin. Some music publications believed the single's success was influenced by a trend of combining Latin pop and urban music.[30] Fonsi referred to it as \"the new pop\" and Ender said that \"everyone is making this type of fusions\".[3] Luis Fonsi also stated that two weeks after the release of the song and its music video he started receiving calls from \"people who normally don't call, people who only call when something different is going on.\" He got calls from Ricky Martin, Juan Luis Guerra, Marc Anthony and other artists telling him that the track was a \"home run\".[31]\n\nSebastian Wernke-Schmiesing of Dance-Charts journal stated that \"a simple 4/4 time, Spanish guitar sounds, a crisp bass, and the excellent vocals by Luis Fonsi and [Daddy Yankee] were enough to get a hit single from the start.\"[32] Leila Cobo of Billboard praised its \"undeniable immediate catchiness\" and wrote that the song \"is a clever blend of romantic Latin pop with a reggaeton beat and subtly naughty lyrics\".[33][34] Robert Joffred of Medium's culture blog That Good You Need highlighted the use of a steel-string guitar to play flamenco-style melodies instead of a nylon-string guitar, as well as the presence of \"swung rhythms\" when the word \"Despacito\" is sung at the beginning of the chorus[29] He referred to the text painting as \"pretty genius\".[29] Raisa Bruner of Time magazine described the single as \"an infectious Latin melody amped up with reggaeton grooves and an irresistible dance tune\".[35]\n\nSpanish record producer Nah\u00fam Garc\u00eda stated that \"the way the rhythm breaks before the chorus is genius\" and that this \"trick\" in particular is not common in pop music.[36] Joshua Barrie of Irish Mirror gave a negative opinion about the lyrics, referring to them as \"quite rude and a bit creepy\" and stating that \"some people might find them offensive\".[37] On the other hand, an editor of Spanish music website Jenesaispop stated that \"the melody is very good, the lyrics are sexy without being vulgar and above all its structure is interesting.\"[38] Felix Contreras of National Public Radio praised the writing, arrangement and performances.[39]\n\nThe remix version featuring Justin Bieber was released on April 17, 2017, by Universal Music Latin, Republic Records, Def Jam Recordings, RBMG and Schoolboy Records.[40] Its official audio video garnered 20 million views on YouTube on its first 24 hours, making it the third-highest debut for a music-related video in 2017 as of September.[41] Caroline Soriano of Ernstars magazine stated that Bieber's voice \"sounds appealing with the song\", whose remix version make it sound \"a little bit better\".[42] Mike Senior of Sound on Sound gave a negative review of the remix's mixing by criticizing its polarity inversion regarding the original version and Justin Bieber's louder vocal track than Daddy Yankee's.[43] As to the original version, Senior referred to the first appearance of the \"Despacito\" hook line as a \"masterstroke\".[43]\n\nIn July 2017, officials from the Government of Malaysia reported that \"Despacito\" was being banned from airing on government-owned broadcast stations as a result of public complaints.[44] Government ministers said that the song was considered un-Islamic and that its lyrics were \"not suitable to be heard\".[44]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\n\"Despacito\" has received various awards and nominations following its commercial success. In 2017, the original version won three awards at the 18th Latin Grammy Awards including Record of the Year, Song of the Year and Best Short Form Music Video, while the remix version won Best Urban

nomination.[50][16]\n\nBillboard's critics ranked the original version the fourth best song of 2017 and the fifth best Latin song of all time, referring to it as \"one of the biggest hits in Latin music history\" and \"one of the biggest singles of all time.\"[51][52] Rolling Stone and Time selected it as the seventh and third best song of 2017, respectively; the latter stating that \"in a year where xenophobia reared its head worldwide, it inspires hope that the charts were dominated by such a universal, multicultural hit.\"[53][35] Spin magazine ranked the remix version the 38th best song of the year, stating that \"it managed to transcend genre, time, space, and even personal taste in a way that was unprecedented.\"[54] It was also included among the 100 best singles of 2017 by

course of pop music forever.\"[50] In 2017, six out of the 10 most-viewed YouTube music videos were for songs performed in Spanish by Latin artists and Billboard's Lars Brandle referred to it as \"the 'Despacito' effect.\"[135]\n\nBritish Official Charts Company recognized it as the song that \"helped Latin pop crossover to the mainstream once again.\"[136] Nielsen's Erin Crawford stated that the

situation that reverted into an \"avalanche of Latin songs around the world.\"[141] Andrew Unterberger of Billboard stated that \"2017 was the year that Latin pop took over the United States\" due to the song and its quick impact on \"Mi Gente\", Camila Cabello's \"Havana\", and the chart performance of acts including Maluma, Ozuna and Bad Bunny, who achieved their biggest hits in the country.[142]\n\nIn July 2017, it was reported that tourist interest in Puerto Rico increased by 45% since the worldwide success of the song.[143][144] Tour operators cite the song's music video for
