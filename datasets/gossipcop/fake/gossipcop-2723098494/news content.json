Because her social feeds got a little bit, well, boring last year - before disappearing altogether.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nMeghan's Instagram page has now been deleted, but if you visited back in 2017 when the couple got engaged, you wouldn't find any posts from April onwards.\n\nHowever, Meghan's insta used to be filled with pictures of a fun-loving young woman - just like anyone else her age - and gave an intimate glimpse into her world.\n\nView 13 Images The daughter of a yoga instructor, she was always going to be good at this (Image: Internet Unknown)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 13 Images Meghan used to get cheeky on Insta (Image: Internet Unknown)\n\nView 13 Images And she was partial to a bedroom mirror selfie (Image: Meghan Markle /Instagram)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 13 Images She's got a sense of humour\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nSnaps from holidays, pictures with friends and photos of her dog - along with selfies from her bed where she sits scantily-clad - feature heavily.\n\nIt's fair to say she wouldn't dream of posting pics of her girls' holiday to Ibiza now she's in Kensington Palace.\n\nIndeed, she now has to follow etiquette suitable for a member of the royal family - and is even scrutinised when she places her legs the 'incorrect' way while sitting down.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 13 Images Meghan enjoyed many holidays with friends before joining the royal family (Image: Meghan Markle /Instagram)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 13 Images Meghan loves animals - especially her dogs (Image: Instagram/meghanmarkle)\n\nMeghan has also swapped her bikinis for fancy hats when in the public eye.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nBut before she met Harry, her pics were just like those of any other young woman.\n\nView 13 Images Having fun on Halloween (Image: meghanmarkle/instagram)\n\nView 13 Images With friend Jessica Mulroney, whose children were flower girls at the wedding (Image: jessicamulroney/Instagram)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nCan you imagine Kate Middleton having an Instagram account where she posts photos of her wine or videos where she sucks raspberries off her fingers?\n\nWell, maybe she should!\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 13 Images This selfie sparked speculation she was dating Harry - thanks to the bracelet (Image: Internet Unknown)\n\nView 13 Images (Image: Internet Unknown)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nMeghan, whose real name is actually Rachel, was given the rank of princess when she tied the knot with Harry.\n\nDespite this, she is not known as 'Princess Meghan' - or, indeed, Princess Rachel - as only women born into the Royal Family inherit this title.\n\nInstead, she is known as Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussex.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nMeghan Markle and Harry's tender moment that royal fans might have missed READ MORE :\n\nView 13 Images Meghan on a trip to Italy with pal Jessica Mulroney (Image: MeghanMarkle/Instagram)\n\n.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 13 Images Jessica started out as Meghan's stylist but the two quickly became close pals (Image: MeghanMarkle/Instagram)\n\nView 13 Images Meghan and her mother Doria at graduation\n\nThe actress, turning 37 on August 4, entered a life of scrutiny when she joined the royal family and therefore was always going to become much more private.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nAnd although we wish she'd kept her Instagram page - it's actually refreshing to see the vibrant personality of a royal family member - it makes sense she has deleted it.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nA version of this article appeared in November 2017.", "images": ["http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/trust-project.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11826174.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Screen-Shot-2016-11-15-at-191918JPG.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11603767.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PROD-Meghan-and-her-mother-Doria.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13701121.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/0_THP_CHP_071218SLUG_0158JPG.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11620452.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Meghan-Markle.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/nav-web-static/release-v41-14493b7c888038a7d89b99cb3a7937c2b71eaebe/public/logo-reach.png", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12769318.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/MAIN-Why-Meghan-always-wears-shoes.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11595976.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Meghan-Markle-with-Star-Wars-actress-Janina-Gavankar.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article9185678.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Screen-Shot-2016-11-03-at-093452.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11596027.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Meghan-Markle-with-Star-Wars-actress-Janina-Gavankar.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13740607.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/0_MAIN-Prince-Harry-Meghan-Markle.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11620457.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_Meghan-Markle.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11826136.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Meghan-Markle.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/assets/mirror/logos/masthead-mirror-default.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article10925901.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/2_PROD-Jessica-Mulroney-and-Meghan-Markle.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11596358.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_MEGAN-MARKLE.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13025706.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Meghan-Markle.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12489805.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/MAIN-Prince-Harry-visit-to-Cardiff-Castle11.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11826215.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/MEGHAN-MARKLE-INSTAGRAM.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11826125.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Meghan-Markle.jpg", "http://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/ipso.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11535254.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Meghan-Markle-is-relocating-her-dogs-to-London.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article11596358.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_MEGAN-MARKLE.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicola Oakley", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/meghan-markle-instagram-deleted-photos-11299580", "title": "the intimate snaps from her life before Prince Harry", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"page_id": 6149699161, "app_id": 123792601022133, "pages": 1814357575554395}, "description": "Meghan used to give her two million followers an intimate insight into her world -
