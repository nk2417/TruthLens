[They had] an epic falling-out.\u201d\n\nKidman, 50, won multiple awards for her portrayal of Big Little Lies \u2018 Celeste Wright, including an Emmy, a Golden Globe, and a Screen Actors Guild award. She has only one Oscar though, which was for her role in The Hours .\n\nMeanwhile, 58-year-old Streep is highly revered in Hollywood and has been nominated for an Oscar an outstanding 21 times, with three total wins. She officially joined the cast in January, playing Mary Louise Wright, the mother-in-law of Kidman\u2019s character, who has come to town to make sure her grandchildren are okay following the death of their father/her son, played in Season 1 by Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd.\n\nWhen it was first announced that Streep would be joining the series, Kidman posted a photo of the two of them together to her Instagram page and said, \u201cWelcome to the [ Big Little Lies ] family Ms. Streep \u2014 can\u2019t wait.\u201d\n\nIf the rumors are true though, somewhere along the line, something changed.\n\n\u201cTheir feud is affecting the entire series,\u201d the Closer source said. \u201cTension on the set is at an all-time high.\u201d\n\nOne factor that may be playing a role in the on-set tension is salary.\n\nFor the first season of Big Little Lies , sources told the Hollywood Reporter that Kidman and Witherspoon each received between $250,000 and $350,000 per episode, along with executive producer fees.\n\nEven though their Season 2 per episode rate has reportedly gone up to $1 million, Streep will make around $800,000 per episode, according to Variety , which is way more than Kidman received during her first year on the HBO series.\n\nPossibly trying to stop these rumors from spreading, Witherspoon posted a picture to Instagram of herself, Kidman, Streep, and Woodley smiling all together at a bowling alley last week.\n\n\u201cWe work and we play! Bowl-a-Rama party with the ladies of [ Big Little Lies ],\u201d she captioned the pic.\n\nBased on the novel, Big Little Lies, by Liane Moriarty, David E. Kelley originally created and wrote HBO\u2019s take on the book as a limited series. After quickly becoming a favorite of both critics and TV viewers, and winning a slew of prestigious awards, HBO announced in December that it would air a second season of the drama, slated to premiere sometime in 2019.\n\n\u201cThe way things are going, who knows if there will be a third season?\u201d the Closer source said.", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2421769f-57a4-4bff-913f-cf316747493e.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20157'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20492%20142'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo-white.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent-Dark-Mode.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/83dc5db4f956e1bfbe5e069fa94d3f1e?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20120%20120'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/meryl-streep-nicole-kidman-feud-on-big-little-lies-set-reports-closer-weekly", "title": "Meryl Streep And Nicole Kidman Feud On \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 Set, Reports \u2018Closer Weekly\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.png", "description": "There\u2019s a feud brewing behind-the-scenes on the Season 2 set of the HBO series, Big Little Lies, and it\u2019s between two much-adored actresses.", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Meryl Streep And Nicole Kidman Feud On \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 Set, Reports \u2018Closer Weekly\u2019 - Inquisitr News", "description": "There\u2019s a feud brewing behind-the-scenes on the Season 2 set of the HBO series, Big Little Lies, and it\u2019s between two much-adored actresses.", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/meryl-streep-nicole-kidman-feud-on-big-little-lies-set-reports-closer-weekly", "site_name": "Inquisitr News"}, "article": {"tag": "zoe kravitz", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-06-10T20:19:00-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Meryl Streep And Nicole Kidman Feud On \u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 Set, Reports \u2018Closer Weekly\u2019 - Inquisitr News", "description": "There\u2019s a feud brewing behind-the-scenes on the Season 2 set of the HBO series, Big Little Lies, and it\u2019s between two much-adored actresses.", "site": "@theinquisitr", "creator": "@theinquisitr"}, "generator": "WP Rocket 3.18.3"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528676340.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
