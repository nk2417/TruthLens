But they have been speaking about the situation, and Angelina hired Johnny\u2019s lawyer to represent her based on the advice that he has given her.\n\n\u201cHer friends are now speculating about what could happen between them if she and Brad are not reconciled and their divorce goes through.\u201d\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Hollywood star Brad - who is said to be 'wrecked' by the fact he hasn't been able to see his kids - is at the centre of claims he clashed with 15-year-old son Maddox on board a private plane days before his wife filed for divorce.\n\nTMZ reports that although the FBI is investigating the incident between Brad, 52, and Maddox, the case is likely to be dropped as conflicting accounts make it impossible to prove what happened.\n\nAnd according to the website: \"DCFS [Department of Children & Family Services] social workers saw no evidence of injuries on Maddox and no one filed a police report after the incident.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 5 Images (L-R) Actress

Brad have previously insisted that allegations of abuse against him are \"exaggerated and fabricated\" with sources close to the actor hitting out at the \"smear campaign\" against him.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nA source told DailyMail.com: \"These claims are exaggerated and fabricated.\n\n\"It's unfortunate for the whole family that people are insisting on continuing this endless smear campaign against Brad that hurts everyone.\n\n\"They are a solid family with two caring parents and a normal share of verbal disagreements like major households.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 5 Images Johnny Depp also hired Wasser (Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"Hopefully people can move on and leave them all alone to work this out.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nMaddox was adopted by Angelina from Cambodia when he was only a few months old in 2002 and Brad, who started dating Angelina a few years later, adopted him in 2006.\n\nThe couple also have children Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, eight together and all six children were onboard the flight when the row broke out.\n\nMirror Celebs has contacted reps for Angelina and Johnny for comment.", "images":
