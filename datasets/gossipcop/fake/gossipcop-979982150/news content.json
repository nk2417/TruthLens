A pioneer in all forms of entertainment. A charitable human. A father,\u201d he wrote. Cook added: \u201cHe meant the world to me& I will forever cherish the time I got to spend with him & his family. At a dark time in my life he brought me joy.\u201d\n\nActor Nicolas Cage, who starred with Lewis in the 2016 film, The Trust, feels the comedian\u2019s death \u201cmarks the end of the golden age of entertainment,\u201d he told PEOPLE in a statement. \u201cHe was my inspiration since I was five. His movies saved my childhood and his extraordinary charisma informed all my performances. I would always ask myself, \u2018What would Jerry do?'\u201d\n\nCage added that Lewis \u201cis always on my mind. He was my friend and my neighbor. He was \u2018The Total Filmmaker \u2014 writer, director, star, and I am deeply saddened that we can\u2019t talk a little more.\u201d\n\nLewis\u2019 Nutty Professor costar Stella Stevens told PEOPLE she was deeply saddened to learn the news of his death.\n\n\u201cJerry was a comic genius, and every day on set I learned so much about filmmaking from him,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThe Nutty Professor remains very close to my heart. Flights of angels, dear man. Love, your Miss Purdy.\u201d\n\nRose Marie, a show business legend herself, shared a sweet photo of herself and Lewis \u2014 with the actor making a silly face.\n\n\u201cJerry Lewis was an angel to me. Loved him & will never forget what he did for me during one of the worst times in my life. RIP, Love Roe,\u201d the 94-year-old tweeted.\n\nMeanwhile, Jim Carrey credited Lewis, writing, \u201cI am because he was.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat fool was no dummy,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cJerry Lewis was an undeniable genius an unfathomable blessing, comedy\u2019s absolute!\u201d\n\nLewis\u2019 agent confirmed the tragic news to PEOPLE, saying that the world \u201chas lost one of the most significant human beings of the 20th century.\u201d The rep added that Lewis died of natural causes while surrounded by his family.\n\nLas Vegas Review Journal columnist John Katsilometes confirmed the news on Twitter on Sunday, writing that Lewis\u2019 rep told him in a statement that he died at 9:15 a.m. on Sunday morning in his home in Las Vegas.\n\nMarlow Stern, a reporter with The Daily Beast, tweeted a statement from Robert De Niro on Lewis\u2019 passing.\n\n\u201cJerry was a pioneer in comedy and film. And he was a friend. I was fortunate to have seen him a few times over the past couple of years,\u201d the statement read. \u201cEven at 91, he didn\u2019t miss a beat \u2026 Or a punchline. You\u2019ll be missed.\u201d\n\nComedy legend Carl Reiner joined in on the string of tributes.\n\n\u201cSo saddened to learn of the passing of Jerry Lewis, a true comic icon,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIn Boston 1947 I roared at his and Dean\u2019s first ever performance.\u201d\n\nGad remembered Lewis with an old photo. \u201cOne of the greatest of all time. A legend. A showman. A comedic icon. A movie star. An activist. A one of a kind. RIP #jerrylewis,\u201d Gad tweeted.\n\nPenn Jillette also reacted to the news on Twitter, being one of the first to reveal that the comedian had died.\n\n\u201cJerry Lewis just died,\u201d Jillette wrote. \u201cWhen I met him, I feel apart, just sobbed. I guess it\u2019s time for that again.\u201d\n\nPatton Oswalt was sure to pen his own tribute to the comedian, writing on Twitter, \u201cJerry Lewis has passed on. I sincerely hope his afterlife is a warm, peaceful \u2026 haven.\u201d\n\nLarry King shared a photo of himself and Lewis in goofy poses before tweeting a moving message: \u201cJerry lived to make the world laugh, and laugh we did for decades. His talent was surpassed only by his humanitarianism. Rest well pal.\u201d\n\nThe death comes about two months after Lewis was hospitalized in Las Vegas with a urinary tract infection \u2014 the latest in a history of health issues.\n\nIn June 2006, Lewis suffered a mild heart attack in San Diego. Still, his manager told PEOPLE at the time, \u201cHe\u2019s doing very well. He\u2019ll be standing on that stage at the [Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Association] telethon on Labor Day.\u201d\n\nIn its time, the annual fundraiser, which Lewis started in 1966 (he stopped hosting as of 2010), is said to have raised more than $2 billion for medical research.\n\nPrior to his heart attack, Lewis had long faced health problems, and in June 2012 was rushed to the hospital with low blood sugar only minutes before he was expected to present an award to Tom Cruise at a New York Friars Club event.\n\nStill, Lewis has managed to maintain his popularity, and legend-status during his decades-long career. His manic style amused generations of moviegoers on both sides of the Atlantic, and his popularity often confounded critics.", "images":
