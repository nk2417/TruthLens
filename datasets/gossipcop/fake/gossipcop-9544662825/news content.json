But, now the 31-year-old designers have turned heads at New York Fashion week for a totally different reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMary-Kate Olsen is reportedly ready to start a family with husband, 48-year-old French financier Olivier Sarkozy, Star Magazine reports. And it alleges she may already be pregnant.\n\nIn a sensational report by the US publication, it\u2019s outrageously claimed that Ashley, rather than being happy for her identical twin sister, is \u2018fuming with jealousy\u2019, which was allegedly evident at their most recent public appearance.\n\n\u2018They\u2019ve been at each other\u2019s throats and fighting over the littlest things ever since Mary-Kate broke the news to Ashley that she and Olivier are trying for a baby,\u2019 a source claimed to the publication. \u2018They put up a good front at the fashion show, but behind-the-scenes it was a nightmare.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ashley is absolutely furious,\u2019 the source adds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe famous sisters looked tense at a recent appearance (Credit: Getty)\n\nStar claims that the petite beauty may have already conceived, noting that the star was spotted outside a West Hollywood sushi bar sporting a baby bump.\n\n\u2018No one would be surprised if she was expecting,\u2019 a source spills to Star. \u2018She and Olivier have been ready to have a baby for more than a year now.\u2019\n\nMary-Kate and Olivier had a desire to start a family shortly after they began dating, Star claims. In 2012 it was reported that the couple were expecting, only to be devastated when Mary-Kate lost the baby a few weeks in.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018That was really painful,\u2019 a friend tells. \u2018But Olivier was totally there for her.\u2019\n\nMary-Kate and Olivier looked smitten on date night (Credit: Getty)\n\nThe Star\u2019s report claims Mary-Kate\u2019s tragedy brought the sisters closer together, with the two showing up to a fashion event clinging together and Ashley clearly protective. But, the thought of Mary-Kate getting pregnant before her left Ashley \u2018seething with jealousy.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ashley is so used to them doing everything together,\u2019 a source dishes to Star. \u2018I\u2019m sure she thought they\u2019d get pregnant at the same time!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Star\u2019s outrageous report, Ashley feels left out. Plus, being a twin means that Mary-Kate\u2019s chances of conceiving multiple babies at the same time could leave Ashley twice as heartbroken.\n\n\u2018Her friends don\u2019t believe she\u2019ll want any part of any baby shower,\u2019 a source told the publication. \u2018It would just be a reminder of everything her sister has that she doesn\u2019t.\u2019\n\nNeither Ashley or Mary-Kate have responded to Star\u2019s allegations.\n\nAdvertisement", "images": ["https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/chrissie-swan-the-shortcut-queen-691e509abfe28.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-20t164344.876-691eaa9997406.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/23423/star-magazine.jpg?resize=1024%2C683", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-18t103613.659-691bb21f4c9ec.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/71038/michael-douglas-and-catherine-zeta-jones-hollywood.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/Logo-1.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/131095/untitled-design-2023-11-08t103411331.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/23419/olivier-sarkozy.jpg?resize=1024%2C683", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/icon-phosphor-circle.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-19t145321.000-691d3f406e345.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/07/NIFLOGO_Organge.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/gettyimages-2156373625-691bc2c3a0fcf-scaled.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/121578/untitled-design-4.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/ni2546pm1_marketing-cover_v0.1-691a9098143bf-scaled.jpg?resize=1955%2C2560", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/air-fryer-1-691eadfe53bed.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?d=mm&s=128", "https://www.newidea.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/1920x1080-2025-11-19t134714.374-691d2fbe0f750.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/07/wordpress-featured-image-template-11-6863926196e99.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-19t162531.737-691d54db7671a.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/media/23420/mary-kate-and-ashley.jpg?resize=682%2C1023", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/11/wp-header-2025-11-18t112445.554-691bbcd84c0f3.png?resize=380%2C285"], "top_img": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2024/05/cropped-NewIdeaFavIcon.png?fit=32%2C32", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Georgia Mars", "Georgia Mars Is A Digital Content Editor At New Idea Magazine.
