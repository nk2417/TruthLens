I thought, \u2018Who is this guy?!\u2019 \u201d Longoria spent the next two-and-a-half years getting to know the father of three, who proposed to her on December 15, 2015 during a trip to Dubai.\n\n\u201cI want to yell from the highest mountaintop about everything that goes on with us because I\u2019m so happy and excited to be with a person as kind as Pepe is,\u201d said Longoria. \u201cHe is probably one of the first men I\u2019ve dated that has been older and established and, basically, a grown-up.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is so nice to be arm-in-arm with someone who is your equal.\u201d\n\nAfter three years and five months of dating, the two wed in May 2016 in Mexico. The couple\u2019s guest list included Victoria Beckham, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Ricky Martin, Katy Perry, Mario Lopez and Longoria\u2019s Telenovela costar Amaury Nolasco.\n\nThe pair got married in a sunset ceremony in Valle de Bravo, Mexico, a lakeside town roughly 88 miles from Mexico City. Longoria wore a white dress designed by best friend Victoria Beckham and her hair was styled by Ken Paves.\n\nOn Tuesday, Longoria\u2019s rep confirmed that the actress is four months along in her pregnancy. The couple will be expecting their first child, a boy, in 2018. Bast\u00f3n is already a parent to three children from a previous marriage.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115933im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/eva-longoria-3-435-14.jpg?w=435", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115933im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/article-covers/3313_106804645_2016_05_02_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115933im_/http://people.com/img/sign-up-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115933im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/eva-longoria-and-jose-baston.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115933im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/eva-longoria-3-435-14.jpg?w=435&h=580&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115933im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115933im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115933im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/eva-longoria-3-435-14.jpg?w=435&h=580&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patrick Gomez"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115933/http://people.com/tv/eva-longoria-engaged-her-love-story-with-jose-pepe-baston/", "title": "Pregnant Eva Longoria: Inside Her Love Story with Jose 'Pepe' Baston", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "eva longoria, eva longoria divorce, eva longoria husbands, eva longoria engaged, eva longoria engagement, eva longoria fiance, eva longoria married, eva longoria and jose baston, eva longoria dating, jose baston, pepe baston", "news_keywords": "eva longoria, eva longoria divorce, eva longoria husbands, eva longoria engaged, eva longoria engagement, eva longoria fiance, eva longoria married, eva longoria and jose baston, eva longoria dating, jose baston, pepe baston", "description": "When Eva Longoria\u00a0first met her future husband, she let him walk right by. \"I was getting out of a bad\u2026", "og": {"title": "Pregnant Eva Longoria: Inside Her Love Story with Jose 'Pepe' Baston", "type": "article", "site_name": "PEOPLE.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115933/http://people.com/tv/eva-longoria-engaged-her-love-story-with-jose-pepe-baston/", "description": "\"I'm so happy and excited to be with a person as kind as Pepe is,\" Longoria told PEOPLE of Jos\u00e9 \"Pepe\" Bast\u00f3n", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115933im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/eva-longoria-3-435-14.jpg?w=435&h=580&crop=1", "width": 435, "height": 580}}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://people.com/tv/eva-longoria-engaged-her-love-story-with-jose-pepe-baston/", "description": "When Eva Longoria\u00a0first met her future husband, she let him walk right by. \"I was getting out of a bad\u2026", "media": "https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/eva-longoria-3-435-14.jpg?w=435&h=580&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115933im_/http://people.com/tv/eva-longoria-engaged-her-love-story-with-jose-pepe-baston/", "title": "Pregnant Eva Longoria: Inside Her Love Story with Husband Jos\u00e9 'Pepe' Bast\u00f3n", "description": "When Eva Longoria\u00a0first met her future husband, she let him walk right by. \"I was getting out of a bad\u2026", "site": "@people", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171220115933im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2016/08/eva-longoria-3-435-14.jpg?w=435&h=580&crop=1"}, "fb": {"pages": 95926963131}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
