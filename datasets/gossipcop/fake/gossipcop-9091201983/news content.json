The momager was of course referring to her nine grandchildren.\n\nRelated: The Kardashian Family: Get to Know the Next Generation While making their mark on the entertainment and business world, the Kardashian-Jenner clan is also raising their next generation. Kourtney Kardashian was the first of Kris Jenner\u2019s children to have kids of her own. Kourtney and her now-ex Scott Disick welcomed their eldest son, Mason, in December 2009, followed by daughter Penelope three years later. [\u2026]\n\nThe Kardashian-Jenner crew grew quite a bit in last few months. Kim Kardashian welcomed her third child \u2014 a daughter named Chicago \u2014 on January 15. Then Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian became first-time moms (They have daughters Stormi, 5 months, and True, 3 months, respectively.)\n\nKris marvels at how Kylie has adjusted to parenthood. \u201cKylie is more calm than I was,\u201d she tells Us. \u201cI look at the way she she loves Stormi and takes care of her. She doesn\u2019t go anywhere without her.\u201d The businesswoman is equally in awe of Khloe \u2014 through she never doubted the Good American denim cofounder\u2019s mothering skills.\n\nRelated: True Thompson\u2019s Baby Album Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian has been a doting mommy ever since her first baby with Tristan Thompson, daughter True, arrived in April 2018. True\u2019s unique name was inspired by Kris Jenner\u2019s grandfather and father. \u201cI sometimes, still can\u2019t believe I\u2019m a mommy!!! True is the sweetest ever. I got my bestie for life! Thank you Jesus for [\u2026]\n\n\u201cI knew she would be amazing. She is always the one who has her house stocked with goodies and takes care of everyone else\u2019s kids,\u201d Kris gushes. \u201cThey all want to have the sleepovers at Auntie KoKo\u2019s. True is the light of her life.\u201d\n\nJust before Khloe gave birth, videos and photos surfaced of her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, getting close with other women during her pregnancy. But fans might not see the drama play out on TV. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on baby and her life,\u201d Kris explains. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of her for being an amazing mommy.\u201d\n\nRelated: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West\u2019s Sweetest Moments With Their Kids These pictures are worth a thousand words \u2014 and then some!

The KKW Beauty creator gave birth to their eldest daughter, North, in June 2013, followed by son Saint two years later.
