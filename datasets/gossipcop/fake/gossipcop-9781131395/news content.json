She was signed to Ford Models at the age of three, and gained early recognition as a child actress on the soap operas Guiding Light (1993) and Another World (1996\u20131997). Her breakthrough role came with the dual role of reunited identical twins in the Walt Disney comedy The Parent Trap (1998); its success led to subsequent roles in Life-Size (2000), Get a Clue (2002), Freaky Friday (2003) and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen (2004). Her portrayal of Cady Heron in the teen comedy Mean Girls (2004) affirmed her status as a teen idol and established her as a prominent leading lady;[5] The New Yorker later ranked it as the eleventh-best film performance of the 21st century.\n\nLohan signed with Casablanca Records and released two studio albums, the platinum-certified Speak (2004) and gold-certified A Little More Personal (Raw) (2005).

To show her range, Lohan began choosing roles in independent films such as A Prairie Home Companion and Bobby (both 2006) and Chapter 27 (2007). Her behavior during the filming of the 2006 dramedy Georgia Rule marked the beginning of personal struggles that plagued her life and career for nearly a decade, making her a fixture in the tabloid press due to legal issues and rehabilitation stints.

Elder of the Chicago Tribune wrote that \"though still a promising star, Lohan will have to do a little penance before she's forgiven for Confessions.\"[42] Her second lead role that year, in the teen comedy Mean Girls, marked Lohan's first movie independent of Disney. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing $129 million worldwide and, according to Brandon Gray, \"cementing her status as the new teen movie queen.\"[40][43][44] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that \"Lohan is sensitive and appealing, a solid locus for audience sympathy.\"[45] David Rooney from Variety said that \"Lohan displays plenty of charm, verve and deft comic timing.\"[46] Lohan received four awards at the 2004 Teen Choice Awards for Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, including Breakout Movie Star.[47] Mean Girls also earned her two awards at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards.[48] In 2021, The New Yorker critic Richard Brody placed Lohan's performance in Mean Girls at number eleven in his list of \"The Best Movie Performances of the Century So Far\".[49]\n\nWith Mean Girls, Lohan's public profile was raised significantly.

Robinson called Lohan \"irresponsible and unprofessional.\" He mentioned \"various late arrivals and absences from the set\" and said that \"we are well aware that your ongoing all night heavy partying is the real reason for your so-called 'exhaustion.'\"[84] In 2007, Lohan was cast in the film Poor Things,[85][86][87][88] however she would ultimately lose the role when she later entered rehab.[89]\n\nIn January 2007, production on the film I Know Who Killed Me was put on hold when Lohan underwent appendix surgery.[90][91][92] While Lohan was in rehab, she continued shooting the film, returning to the facility at night.[93][94] Shortly thereafter, Lohan withdrew from a film adaptation of Oscar Wilde's A Woman of No Importance, her publicist stating that Lohan needed to \"focus on getting better.\"[95][96] Lohan was replaced in The Edge of Love in April 2007, shortly before filming was to begin, with the director citing \"insurance reasons\" and Lohan later explaining that she \"was going through a really bad time then.\"[97][98][99] Lohan withdrew from a scheduled appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in which she had been due to promote I Know Who Killed Me, a psychological horror-thriller in which she stars as a stripper with a dual personality.[100] The film premiered in July 2007 to what Entertainment Weekly called \"an abysmal $3.5 million.\"[101] It earned Lohan dual Golden Raspberry awards for Worst Actress, with Lohan coming first and second, tying with herself.[102] Hollywood executives and industry insiders commented that it would be difficult for Lohan to find employment until she could prove that she was sober and reliable, citing possible issues with securing insurance.[103][104][105]\n\nIn May 2008, Lohan's single \"Bossy\" was released onto digital outlets, and reached number one on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart.

I was put between my mother and father a lot\".[22][236] Despite the conflicts, Lohan spoke very fondly of her family.[237][238] But in the late 2000s, she said she had cut off contact with her father, calling his behavior unpredictable and hard to deal with.[239][240][241][242] In 2023, Lohan said she was on good terms with both her parents as the family gathered in April, which reportedly marked the first time they were all together in at least seven years.[243]\n\nLohan has had many high-profile relationships, including with actor Wilmer Valderrama in 2004, Hard Rock Cafe heir Harry Morton in 2006, DJ Samantha Ronson in 2008,[244][245][246][247] and London-based Russian business heir Egor Tarabasov in 2016.[248] On November 28, 2021, Lohan announced her engagement to financier Bader Shammas after three years of dating.[249] Bader Shammas is a Kuwaiti citizen and a member of the Shammas family, one of the twelve Kuwaiti Christian families.[250] On July 2, 2022, a representative confirmed Lohan and Shammas were married after she called him her \"husband\" on her Instagram birthday post.[251] Lohan later revealed they had wed on April 3, 2022.[252] In July 2023, she gave birth to their son in Dubai, where she has resided since 2014.[253][254]\n\nFilmography\n\nAfter beginning her acting career as a child actor in the early 1990s, Lohan, at age eleven, made her film debut in Disney's hugely successful remake of The Parent Trap (1998). Freaky Friday (2003) remains her highest-grossing film, while Mean Girls (2004),[255] both a critical and commercial success, became a cult classic. Though her career was often interrupted by legal and personal troubles during the late 2000s and early 2010s, she has appeared in over 30 films and has multiple other acting credits as of 2025.[256][257]\n\nDiscography\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\nReferences", "images": ["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d3/Lindsay_Lohan.jpg/250px-Lindsay_Lohan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/20px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Actress_Lindsay_Lohan.jpg/250px-Actress_Lindsay_Lohan.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Lindsay_Lohan_at_Cynthia_Rowley.jpg/250px-Lindsay_Lohan_at_Cynthia_Rowley.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Wikidata-logo.svg/40px-Wikidata-logo.svg.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/7d/Lindsay_Lohan_in_strapless_white_gown.jpg/250px-Lindsay_Lohan_in_strapless_white_gown.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Lindsay_Lohan_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/250px-Lindsay_Lohan_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/20px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4d/Lindsay_Lohan_2019.png/250px-Lindsay_Lohan_2019.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Lindsay_Lohan_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/960px-Lindsay_Lohan_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Lindsay_Lohan_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/960px-Lindsay_Lohan_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Lohan", "title": "Lindsay Lohan", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Lindsay_Lohan_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/960px-Lindsay_Lohan_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg", "width": 895, "height": 1200}, "title": "Lindsay Lohan - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
