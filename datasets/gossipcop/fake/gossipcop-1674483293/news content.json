In a message on Instagram, he has elaborated on his reasons.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned the more you appreciate your calling the more you want to protect your calling,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMe taking this time right now is me saying I want to be SUSTAINABLE... so that I can be the man I want to be, the husband I eventually want to be, and the father I want to be.\u201d\n\nPerhaps referring to the string of fractious incidents he has been involved with, including punching a Spanish fan, driving drunk in a Lamborghini and being banned from China, he added: \"Learning and growing hasn't always been easy but knowing I'm not alone has kept me going. I have let my insecurities get the best of me at times, I let my broken relationships dictate the way I acted toward people and the way I treated them. I let bitterness, jealousy and fear run my life.!!!! ... What I'm not gonna do is be ashamed of my mistakes. I wanna be a man that learns from them and grows from them.!!\"\n\nHe signed off by apologising for any grammatical errors: \u201cI THINK THERES SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT IMPERFECTIONS!!\u201d\n\nWith the tour now finished, the statement closes a chapter of his career. His album Purpose spawned a series of colossal hit singles, including What Do You Mean, Love Yourself, and Sorry, which until recently was the most streamed song of all time globally. It was replaced by Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee's Despacito, which Bieber also features on.\n\nGuardian Service", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8946263&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/2FDP3WFNDBFX5KZQK6JJNEIZWE.jpeg?focal=1493%2C1109&auth=60630f14d2b384f7880801c2d1ddc5e80fbeb0e7ae934f0c8578350d28d0e396&width=274&height=154", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/NQAHQ46WMNCUJOM6GRZHTXYGPI.jpg?focal=4117%2C2589&auth=26433cb0ebd277e2606be8839978fa657bb3e31991daf214dfbe95bb4d79204b&width=274&height=154", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fcloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com%2Firishtimes%2FSJQTLMCMMRC2PLALXUKEWWS6HU.png?auth=da79116e886b06f984d64a26ff33e5a486859d0f04b208ceca44b81890df342f&width=600", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/NO4NN652DNEGZPGIBGVIQO6KX4.png?smart=true&auth=129b5af2c183a4afe32feec7e14c7ac6652d889daf1553a42ca9e77d1a89ef2e&width=274&height=154", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/HTJHZ5LL3EV7PC2AO2L3TZPMSM.jpg?auth=1f8e15e7c92ddd511f4f6b6887d22d4d33786224524697d83bdede2e12b5c92f&smart=true&width=1024&height=576", "http://www.irishtimes.com/pf/resources/logo-white.svg?d=201", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/HTJHZ5LL3EV7PC2AO2L3TZPMSM.jpg?smart=true&auth=1f8e15e7c92ddd511f4f6b6887d22d4d33786224524697d83bdede2e12b5c92f&width=1200&height=630", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/BQEVJYLRBRC7TDNXBNZWDLDQHI.jpg?focal=2357%2C1713&auth=9600082668c3b216e5dc880f8b40fda8cbeddb8ea7fbdd999a04c044bb5a3002&width=274&height=154", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/XVZZZNEQCXNXSLFF2X3TMPUIPE.jpg?smart=true&auth=c829ccead9297709cf1788b02e9d821bb9c51ed35ea71f064d32205721c9105c&width=274&height=154", "http://www.irishtimes.com/pf/resources/download-on-the-app-store.png?d=201", "https://cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sandbox.irishtimes/NBZTERI3LJCBNBYCBPDZJLZMV4.png", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/HAUN2Q7FDZPNBEG4NWVSV4VFXM.jpg?smart=true&auth=08caee56dcdce78f618f7b9f037eeff25b1a69e55ab6dec091df27fa265946df&width=274&height=154", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/FFYVBUEMRBFOPM55VC7FNAPXCE.jpg?smart=true&auth=9c29be3e57ca6679a08f34541561692d1f3f394d504b8b29451d3ef8102ce1dd&width=274&height=154", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/6JXTP3MLWRA4XMBJP5OAZ5QL44.jpg?focal=1931%2C1064&auth=17f160b444f8ce6a9c7986d0360d12f2a767b86f021a808a238596519f31d756&width=274&height=154", "https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/irishtimes/1647534191733.svg", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/TBBSUABOFJFLNFFRDM6F7B56SI.jpg?smart=true&auth=d2ae071e559593911edfc69f36ff6955471df11c547d79e71fb784fcfe6ea894&width=274&height=154", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/OW5W4T5ZFVGKTOCF6P5WUB47LM.jpg?smart=true&auth=5f3f2826eee845a39abd9c2ef398d1356a13f2bd2985239802df43575d1adb36&width=274&height=154", "http://www.irishtimes.com/pf/resources/get-it-on-google-play.png?d=201"], "top_img": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/HTJHZ5LL3EV7PC2AO2L3TZPMSM.jpg?smart=true&auth=1f8e15e7c92ddd511f4f6b6887d22d4d33786224524697d83bdede2e12b5c92f&width=1200&height=630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thu Aug -"], "canonical_link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/justin-bieber-s-tour-cancellation-i-want-to-be-sustainable-1.3175464", "title": "Justin Bieber\u2019s tour cancellation: \u2018I want to be sustainable\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "\u2018I let jealousy and fear run my life\u2019: The pop star explains why he has cancelled 14 shows", "twitter": {"description": "\u2018I let jealousy and fear run my life\u2019: The pop star explains why he has cancelled 14 shows", "title": "Justin Bieber\u2019s tour cancellation: \u2018I want to be sustainable\u2019", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/HTJHZ5LL3EV7PC2AO2L3TZPMSM.jpg?smart=true&auth=1f8e15e7c92ddd511f4f6b6887d22d4d33786224524697d83bdede2e12b5c92f&width=1200&height=630", "alt": "Justin Bieber: his Instagram message elaborated on his reasons for cancelling the rest of his world tour.
