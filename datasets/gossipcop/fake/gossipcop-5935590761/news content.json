We tried hard for a long time and we\u2019re really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much.\u201d\n\nRead the full post below.\n\nPratt and Faris have been married since 2008, and have one child together, Jack.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about their relationship:\n\n1. They Met While Playing Love Interests in the 2007 Film \u2018Take Me Home Tonight\u2019\n\nPlay\n\nWhile Pratt and Faris grew up only 20 minutes away from each other, they didn\u2019t meet until they were cast as love interests in the 2011 comedy Take Me Home Tonight (production began in 2007). Faris was married to actor Ben Indra at the time, but it was obvious that sparks were flying between her and the Parks & Recreation alum.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect,\u201d Pratt told Elle magazine, \u201cThey both had one foot out the door for a long time. We were friends first, but she left her husband at the end of the movie, and we started dating when we were back in L.A. So we were friends, and I was there for her\u2026 We never crossed the line. But we were, I think, developing feelings for each other at the time, you know? The day that she told me she was leaving her husband, I knew that I was going to marry her.\u201d\n\nPlay\n\nFaris divorced Indra in 2008, and she and Pratt were married the following year in Bali, Indonesia. The Scary Movie actress told People magazine that it was a small ceremony and that her new husband was \u201cA great guy. I feel really lucky.\u201d\n\nPratt and Faris have continued to act alongside one another, co-starring in What\u2019s Your Number? (2011) and Movie 43 (2013). In the latter, they play characters who are romantically involved.\n\n2. Pratt Claimed Their Relationship Made Him Believe in \u2018Divine Intervention & Destiny\u2019\n\nPlay\n\nBoth Pratt and Faris have been vocal and supportive of each other in the media, and when the former held an AMA Reddit in 2015, he went as far as to say that Faris made him believe in divine intervention. \u201cAnna and I are meant to be together,\u201d he wrote, \u201cOur relationship has made me believe in divine intervention and destiny, just as much as my crazy career and the way I fell into this life.\u201d\n\nPratt went on to highlight the similarities their careers have, listing \u201cWe both got our start in horror spoofs. We both did an animated movie for Phil Lord and Chris Miller. We both made our careers guileless nitwits for laughs We both have parents that have suffered with MS. The similarities go on and on. Anna is a great wife. Very patient and understanding.\u201d\n\nPlay\n\nThey have also been known to poke fun at their public image. Faris jokingly interviewed Jennifer Lawrence, who filmed a sex scene with Pratt for the film Passengers (2016), while the couple played exaggerated versions of themselves for a People\u2019s Choice Award skit.\n\nAs a result, Pratt and Faris have frequently been cited as one of the most beloved couples in Hollywood.\n\n3. Their Son, Jack Pratt, Was Born Premature in 2012\n\nThe couple welcomed their first and only child, Jack Pratt, in August 2012. According to People magazine, Jack was born nine weeks premature, and subsequently spent time in an intensive care unit. \u201cWe were scared for a long time,\u201d said Pratt, \u201cWe prayed a lot.\u201d\n\nFaris recounted the experience to Redbook magazine in 2015: \u201cMy water broke in the middle of the night at seven months. We rushed to the hospital, and they were able to halt active labor with magnesium. I was at the hospital and the goal was to be in bed for four weeks\u2026 but on the seventh day, I went into labor again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was in denial,\u201d Faris added, \u201cFor hours I was like, \u2018I\u2019m just having indigestion.\u2019 Chris and I were so scared, but when Jack came out, even though he was so tiny, he looked so good to us.\u201d\n\nAfter Jack\u2019s health improved, Pratt told People magazine was it gave him a new outlook on life. \u201cIt restored my faith in God, not that it needed to be restored, but it really redefined it. \u201d\n\nPratt went on to say \u201cThe baby was so beautiful to us, and I look back at the photos of him and it must have been jarring for other people to come in and see him, but to us he was so beautiful and perfect.\u201d\n\n4. Faris Admitted That Pratt\u2019s Cheating Rumors Made Her Feel \u2018Insecure\u2019 in 2016\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_LIrZ-aUaso\n\nDuring an episode of her podcast Unqualified, Faris spoke on the tabloid rumors that Pratt was having an extramarital affair with Lawrence. \u201cWe grapple with the idea of being a public couple,\u201d she told her special guest Isla Fisher, \u201cFor the first time, maybe a year ago or 10 months ago, we were in the public a little bit. There were some tabloid rumors about strain in our relationship. I just remember feeling so hurt in a way that bothered me because I didn\u2019t want to think of myself as somebody that could be affected by tabloid s**t.\u201d\n\nFaris went on to say \u201cI take pride in how great my relationship is with Chris. But having said that, of course, in this crazy world where hr\u2019s off doing movies and I\u2019m in L.A. raising our child, of course I\u2019m going to feel vulnerable, like any normal human would. It made me feel incredibly insecure.\u201d\n\nThese rumors were never proven to be true, and according to OK Magazine, Lawrence was devastated by any issues she caused in her co-star\u2019s marriage. A source close to the actress said \u201cJen has found the claims very upsetting, because she\u2019d never go near a married man.\u201d\n\n5. While They Are Separated, They Remain Legally Married\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BSGwazPjRhM/?hl=en&taken-by=prattprattpratt\n\nWhile Pratt stated in his Facebook post that he and Faris will be legally separated, he made no mention of divorce. According to Attorneys.com, a legal separation means that you are still legally married to your spouse even though you are living apart. This means that if Pratt and Faris intended to divorce at some point, they would still have to go through the legal steps necessary to terminate their marriage.\n\nFaris posted the same announcement on her official Twitter account, in the form of a text screenshot. Both actors have made it a point to keep the details of their separation private for the sake of their son.\n\nIn an interview with E! Online in 2016, Faris spoke on the importance that raising Jack has on both of their lives: \u201cWe want Jack to have as normal of a childhood or at least a similar childhood as we had.\u201d She also proved that media exposure hasn\u2019t diminished her son\u2019s sense of wonderment. \u201cThe other day I was picking him up from his pre-school and there was some paparazzi\u2014that doesn\u2019t happen very often, when Chris is around and in town it\u2019s different\u2014but Jack waved at them and said, \u2018Cheese!'\u201d", "images": ["https://entertainmentnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2026-90s-Con-Date-Announcement-1.jpg", "https://entertainmentnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cropped-cropped-icon.png?w=32", "https://entertainmentnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/the-amazing-race-season-38-winners-2025-episode-9-spoilers.jpg?w=864", "https://entertainmentnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gettyimages-629895228.jpg?w=864", "https://entertainmentnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1190357606-e1763605333798.jpg?w=864", "https://entertainmentnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/entertainmentnow-logo.webp", "https://entertainmentnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/google_preferred_source_badge_light@2x.png", "https://i0.wp.com/entertainmentnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/entertainmentnow-placeholder-image.png?resize=350%2C200&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/entertainmentnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/450443382_10.jpg?resize=350%2C200&ssl=1", "https://entertainmentnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/the-amazing-race-2025-eliminations-week-9-season-38-results.jpg?w=864", "https://entertainmentnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/logo-white.png?w=410", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cf735df4b7a87819dbc77d99c32ac5a78ea455ffbfdecf3c1733f774cf46704d?s=60&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://entertainmentnow.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cropped-cropped-icon.png?w=32", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Entertainment Now Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://entertainmentnow.com/news/chris-pratt-anna-faris-separating-divorce-children-cheating-rumors-photos/", "title": "Chris Pratt & Anna Faris Separation: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "facebook-domain-verification": "0npeotcku0mmu3nflypbk0lyvmzlu3", "description": "Chris Pratt and Anna Faris are legally separating.
