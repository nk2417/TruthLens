The \"Red\" singer, 24, has distanced herself from former best friend Selena Gomez after the Disney star reconnected with her infamous ex-boyfriend, 20, sources confirm to Us Weekly.\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Justin and Selena\u2019s complicated romance Justin serenaded his friend and fellow performer Gomez to his hit \u201cOne Less Lonely Girl\u201d during Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve at Aria Resort & Casino in Las Vegas.

Two days later, the \"Come And Get It\" crooner accompanied the Biebs to the SXSW music fest where he sang his hit \"As Long as You Love Me\" to her.\n\nBut Gomez rekindling of the Jelena flame isn't the only thing peeving Swift. She believes Gomez \"used\" a brief romance with the Grammy winner's pal Ed Sheeran last June to make her jailbird sweetie jealous.\n\n\"After Selena pulled that move, Taylor started distancing herself,\" a source tells Us.\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Justin\u2019s biggest scandals Chalk it up to growing pains?

Here, Us Weekly chronicles the Biebs\u2019 craziest scandals \u2014 from an insensitive visit to the Anne Frank House to a mysterious night with a Brazilian woman (complete with a snoozing Bieber video [\u2026]\n\nAnd Swift has plenty of besties to spend time with otherwise. Recently she's been spotted with Modern Family's Sarah Hyland, True Grit's Hailee Steinfeld, Victoria's Secret model Karlie Kloss, and even Gomez's enemy, New Zealander Lorde. But while their friendship may be struggling, a Swift pal insists that the country artist-turned-pop vocalist loves Gomez and will always be there for her.", "images":
