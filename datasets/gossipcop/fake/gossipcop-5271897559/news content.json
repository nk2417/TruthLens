Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT One local told Vanity Fair: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear they want to be left alone. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT \u201cThe property is in the middle of woodland and you wouldn\u2019t know it was there. \u201cIt is very remote which is why they like it. It\u2019s like a fortress.\n\n\u201cThey both expect a code of silence\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge security presence, you can\u2019t get close.\u201d A source close to the couple said: \u201cThey spend a lot of time in the Cotswolds, more than people realise. \u201cThey are in the country way more than they are in London and enjoying a low-key and very domesticated start to married life.\u201d The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are due to spend time with The Queen in Balmoral next month with the Duchess reportedly also keen to visit her mother in Los Angeles.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Last month Mr Markle provocatively claimed that Princess Diana would have \u201cloathed\u201d the way he was being treated by the Royal Family. Royal editor Camilla Tominey commented: \u201cThey have both been extremely upset by Thomas Markle\u2019s behaviour and that of Meghan\u2019s half sister Samantha and other relatives.\n\n\u201cThey
