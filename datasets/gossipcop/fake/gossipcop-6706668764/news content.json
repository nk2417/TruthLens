Stand Up, Don\u2019t Shoot, described as a stand-up special in which Cannon takes on race and other topics, premiered Friday on Showtime.\n\n.\n\n\u201cAfter days of deliberating over some extremely disappointing news that I was being threatened with termination by Executives because of a comedy special that was only intended to bring communities closer together, I was to be punished for a joke,\u201d he writes on Instagram and Facebook. \u201cThis has weighed heavy on my spirit. It was brought to my attention by my \u201cteam\u201d that NBC believed that I was in breach of contract because I had disparaged their brand. In my defense, I would ask how so? Or is this just another way to silence and control an outspoken voice who often battles the establishment.\u201d\n\nWhat Cannon is referring to is a fairly standard clause in employment contracts that does not allow an employee to disparage the company they work for. He goes on to say,\u201d I find myself in a dark place having to make a decision that I wish I didn\u2019t have to, but as a man, an artist, and a voice for my community I will not be silenced, controlled or treated like a piece of property. There is no amount of money worth my dignity or my integrity. I have loved hosting AMERICAS GOT TALENT for the last 8 seasons, watching talented, brave, and courageous Americans accomplish their dreams in front of millions has been nothing but a joy, and everyone has been a pleasure to work with but my soul won\u2019t allow me to be in business with corporations that attempt to frown on freedom of speech, censor artists, and question cultural choices.\u201d\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nDeadline has reached out to NBC for comment.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BQc4jupgJMD/?taken-by=nickcannon", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nick-cannon-2.jpg?w=875", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nick-cannon-2.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nick-cannon-2.jpg?w=875", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Denise Petski", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2017/02/nick-cannon-leaving-americas-got-talent-threats-firing-racial-joke-1201910314/", "title": "Nick Cannon Says He\u2019s Leaving \u2018America\u2019s Got Talent\u2019 After Threats Of Firing Over Racial Joke", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Nick Cannon says he's leaving NBC's America's Got Talent after he learned network execs were considering firing him over a racial joke.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Denise Petski", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Nick Cannon Says He\u2019s Leaving \u2018America\u2019s Got Talent\u2019 After Threats Of Firing Over Racial Joke", "url": "https://deadline.com/2017/02/nick-cannon-leaving-americas-got-talent-threats-firing-racial-joke-1201910314/", "description": "Nick Cannon says he's leaving NBC's America's Got Talent after he learned network execs were considering firing him over a racial joke.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nick-cannon-2.jpg?w=875", "width": 875, "height": 425, "alt": "Nick Cannon America's Got Talent"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-02-13T15:20:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-09-06T22:13:10+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nick Cannon says he's leaving NBC's America's Got Talent after he learned network execs were considering firing him over a racial joke.", "site": "@Deadline", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Nick Cannon Says He\u2019s Leaving \u2018America\u2019s Got Talent\u2019 After Threats Of Firing Over Racial Joke", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/nick-cannon-2.jpg?w=875"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1486999243.0, "source": "http://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
