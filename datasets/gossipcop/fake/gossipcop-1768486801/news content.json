While Megyn Kelly\u2019s had a rocky start to her hour of \u201cToday,\u201d co-star Matt Lauer doesn\u2019t seem to be defending her.\n\nWhen an industry insider remarked to Lauer last week that celebrities are being advised to avoid Kelly\u2019s \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d \u2014 amid ratings struggles and awkward snafus with famous guests \u2014 a Page Six spy overheard Lauer reply that he \u201cgets it,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a big problem for them,\u201d meaning Kelly\u2019s show. Insiders were stunned that the veteran \u201cToday\u201d host didn\u2019t try to defend his new colleague.\n\nWe\u2019re told publicists have been steering their clients to other shows, partly because of Kelly\u2019s ailing ratings and partly because of the dust-ups with Jane Fonda and Debra Messing. In September \u2014 just two days into her run as host of the 9 a.m. hour of \u201cToday\u201d \u2014 Kelly upset Fonda by bringing up the actress\u2019 plastic surgery past.\n\nMessing said that she \u201cregretted\u201d appearing on the show after an awkward moment during which Kelly asked a \u201csuperfan\u201d audience member, \u201cIs it true that you became a lawyer, and you became gay, because of [co-star Eric McCormack\u2019s character] Will?\u201d\n\nAnother reason that Hollywood flacks are booking clients elsewhere is that Kelly is struggling to hang on to viewers. As Page Six recently reported, her numbers are nearly at an all-time low for the famed NBC morning show and she continues to drag down \u201cKathie Lee & Hoda.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis week was the lowest Kathie and Hoda have rated since 2010,\u201d said a source. \u201cIt keeps getting worse. Megyn is killing them. It is a real problem and no one wants to book Megyn\u2019s show,\u201d the insider said. Another source added, \u201cThey can keep telling you about all the lunches they\u2019re taking her to, but it\u2019s not helping the ratings.\u201d\n\nBut a rep for \u201cToday\u201d downplayed any drama, telling us: \u201cSounds like a few troublemakers are trying to stir up drama where there just isn\u2019t any. Everyone\u2019s doing just fine at the \u2018Today\u2019 show.\u201d\n\nNBC crowed this week that \u201cToday\u201d \u201cwas the No. 1 morning show outright, topping \u2018Good Morning America\u2019 in total viewers and all demos last Monday.\u201d", "images": ["https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/CMA.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F100-live-115674573.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115743727.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115485559.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/kevin-spacey-reveals-homeless-living-115762000.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/fergie.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115752191.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fjones-road-black-friday-sale.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1763551750&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fbethenny-frankels-gift-picks-include-115619188.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115742458.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/fergie.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/kevin-spacey-reveals-homeless-living-115762000.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115723827.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115733621.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/minka-kelly-jenna-bush-hager.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/matt-megyn.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115723827.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115742458.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115731438.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2FCMA.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2FKrisJennersaystheseamazingPDRNproductshavebecomehernewessentials.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/matt-megyn.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115757930.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/matt-megyn.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/10/30/matt-lauer-throws-megyn-kelly-under-the-bus/", "title": "Exclusive | Matt Lauer throws Megyn Kelly under the bus", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
