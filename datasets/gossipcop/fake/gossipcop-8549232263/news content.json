(For context, despite only starring in a few films since the Twilight saga released it's final movie in 2011, he says he reads \"eight scripts each week,\" or 400 per year.)\n\nReferencing the Lionsgate CEO who recently said that there are \"more stories to be told\" within the Twilight and Hunger Games franchises, Robert was asked whether or not he'd be open to reprising his role.\n\nFirst he responded by throwing his hands up in the air with a \"faux-enthusiastic\" \"yes,\" but then backtracked, saying: \u201cWell, you never know.\"\n\n\"It did inspire me at the time,\" he continued, \"And, really, it\u2019s kind of awesome. It\u2019s the way people interpret it. People would excuse you for not taking something seriously if it becomes this mainstream thing and everyone\u2019s fiending. I took it just as seriously \u2014 more seriously \u2014 than other things I\u2019ve done.\u201d\n\nHe also talked about developing what's being referred to as \"paparazzi PTSD\" from the ordeal. And as for the term \"franchises,\" Pattinson doesn't support it.\n\n\u201cI remember when \u2018Twilight\u2019 first came out, it was the first time I\u2019d really heard film series be referred to as \u2018franchises,\u2018\u201d Pattinson said. \u201cAnd then you see everyone talking about the word \u2018franchise\u2019 as if it\u2019s this revered term. \u2018Franchise\u2019 should not be about a movie. That\u2019s a fast-food restaurant. Everyone was like \u2018the franchise, the franchise\u2019 the whole time. I just thought, \u2018Shut up!\u2019 It\u2019s rote. All these actors are saying \u2018franchise\u2019 \u2015 it\u2019s like, what are you doing? You\u2019ve drunk the Kool-Aid!\u201d\n\nIt seems throughout the conversation, Robert is outlining and illustrating his desire to re-define himself as an actor outside of a young adult cult fiction series, but he also doesn't seem 100% deterred from reprising the role of Edward.\n\nRelated: Robert Pattinson Was on the Same Flight as Kristen Stewart and Stella Maxwell\n\nCheck This Out:", "images": ["http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/69026ffebde798db4010caf1/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6915ab5cf123d4b2f5690bc6/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/691251f73c97e98bf9922bc6/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6855545f9550c207fb02e715/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68fceec7daf24cf1ce68ee66/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6912660944b56dadab2b775f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5991ff84fc885e5cc9aba94d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68e7846e0f5f22462a6f9232/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5991ff8084cbab724ff072fd/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/lede.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/630e3468db6f4adb6168dc7d/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a3b2049f01b6d6b153e9a84/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6883311cdf45c0ce457bebda/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6894890bb0414fdff135dbc0/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/690892896c20c256ee25ca0c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6915dfa04acc6d11212f1724/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5991ff84fc885e5cc9aba94d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brianna Wiest"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/robert-pattinson-responds-twilight-revival-rumors", "title": "Robert Pattinson Responds To Those 'Twilight' Revival Rumors", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Brianna Wiest", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Robert Pattinson discusses his movie career, and whether or not he'd return to the role of Edward in a 'Twilight' revival.", "id": "5991ef71fc885e5cc9aba949", "keywords": "robert pattinson,twilight", "news_keywords": "robert pattinson,twilight", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5991ef71fc885e5cc9aba949", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Robert Pattinson discusses his movie career, and whether or not he'd return to the role of Edward in a 'Twilight' revival.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5991ff7c93f92551f0bff472/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/tout.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5991ff7c93f92551f0bff472/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/tout.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "!!!", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5991ff84fc885e5cc9aba94d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Robert Pattinson Isn't Ruling Out a Return to \"Twilight\"", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/robert-pattinson-responds-twilight-revival-rumors"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-08-14T19:53:21.636Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-14T19:53:21.636Z", "author": "Brianna Wiest"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "!!!", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5991ff84fc885e5cc9aba94d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/facebook.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Robert Pattinson Isn't Ruling Out a Return to \"Twilight\""}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5991ff84fc885e5cc9aba94d/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/facebook.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502740401.636, "source": "http://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
