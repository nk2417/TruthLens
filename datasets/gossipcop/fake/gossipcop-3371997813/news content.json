Even an open letter in the Huffington Post pleading that the tabloids stop reporting false stories about her and her marriage has not managed to take tabloid focus off the star.\n\nAlthough the pregnancy rumors have halted since Jen penned the letter in the publication, she remains the subject of falsities about her marriage and has recently admitted that she feels although the essay did make media members more aware of the affects such falsities have on celebrities and the manner that women are discussed in the media, that it did little to halt the fabricated tales from making the front page about she and other female figures in the spotlight.\n\nThe beauty spoke with Variety recently on the topic as Vanity Fair relays.\n\n\u201cI had no idea it would get the response that it did; I was thrilled with that. But sadly, people still buy into it. They are consumers of this trash and they eat it up. It\u2019s definitely in people\u2019s consciousness a lot more. But you\u2019re always going to have the Piers Morgans of the world contradicting something that comes from the heart and saying, \u2018You\u2019re a hypocrite.\u201d\n\nAniston\u2019s point is validated by recent rumors that claimed Jen and Justin had a blowout fight at actor Orlando Bloom\u2019s birthday celebration. In Touch has ignited this rumor, as Gossip Cop shares. The tabloid claims that the couple had a \u201cmiserable night out\u201d while at Bloom\u2019s 40th in Palm Springs. The gossip policing site shares the claims by the tabloid.\n\n\u201cAt one point, Justin was having a blast with Orlando and Leo [DiCaprio]. But Jen obviously didn\u2019t like that they were stealing his attention away from her, so she walked over and took Justin\u2019s hand and pulled him away.\u201d\n\nThe insider adds that Aniston \u201c\u2026 would pout and get angry any time Justin started to have fun\u2026 Justin\u2019s pals actually felt bad for him.\u201d The insider adds that Jen \u201cis always monitoring Justin\u2019s life, and no one can take it anymore. His friends have told him enough is enough.\u201d\n\nJennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux Not Caught Openly Fighting At Orlando Bloom\u2019s Birthday Party, Despite Report https://t.co/sup8sK42He \u2014 Gossip Cop (@GossipCop) January 26, 2017\n\nGC has checked with both stars\u2019 reps. Aniston\u2019s rep assures that the story is \u201cridiculous,\u201d while Theroux\u2019s rep insists the claim is simply \u201cfalse.\u201d The site reminds that In Touch has reported false stories about Jen and Justin in the past, including when it alleged that the happy couple were taking a vacation to try to save their marriage.\n\nJennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux join in on the fun at Orlando Bloom\u2019s surprise birthday party https://t.co/aVf3C4PqrO pic.twitter.com/YKEqP7bxZs \u2014 People Magazine (@people) January 16, 2017\n\nIt\u2019s clear that those behind the false claims about Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux, and those photographers who incessantly hassle the star to snap an image that can be used to begin one of those false claims, have not heeded her words about how frustrated she is with the ludicrous claims made on the daily about she and Justin, in addition to other mainly female celebrities who endure the same treatment. Despite not being fully heeded, Aniston\u2019s words in the Huffington Post letter \u201cFor the Record,\u201d are certainly worth revisiting in hopes that they will one day resonate and inspire change.\n\n\u201cIf I am some kind of symbol to some people out there, then clearly I am an example of the lens through which we, as a society, view our mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, female friends and colleagues. The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing. The way I am portrayed by the media is simply a reflection of how we see and portray women in general, measured against some warped standard of beauty.\u201d\n\n[Featured Image by Mark Davis/Getty Images]", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2421769f-57a4-4bff-913f-cf316747493e.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20157'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7c579880583dd6b39bd9186b37bc2101?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20492%20142'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo-white.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent-Dark-Mode.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20120%20120'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/despite-claims-jennifer-aniston-and-justin-theroux-did-not-fight-at-orlando-blooms-birthday-celebration", "title": "Despite Claims, Jennifer Aniston And Justin Theroux Did Not Fight At Orlando Bloom\u2019s Birthday Celebration", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.png", "description": "If it isn\u2019t pregnancy rumors Jennifer Aniston is the subject of, the beauty is making tabloid headlines for her apparent troubled relationship with her", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Despite Claims, Jennifer Aniston And Justin Theroux Did Not Fight At Orlando Bloom\u2019s Birthday Celebration - Inquisitr News", "description": "If it isn\u2019t pregnancy rumors Jennifer Aniston is the subject of, the beauty is making tabloid headlines for her apparent troubled relationship with her", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/despite-claims-jennifer-aniston-and-justin-theroux-did-not-fight-at-orlando-blooms-birthday-celebration", "site_name": "Inquisitr News"}, "article": {"tag": "Orlando Bloom", "section": "News", "published_time": "2017-01-26T16:42:00-05:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Despite Claims, Jennifer Aniston And Justin Theroux Did Not Fight At Orlando Bloom\u2019s Birthday Celebration - Inquisitr News", "description": "If it isn\u2019t pregnancy rumors Jennifer Aniston is the subject of, the beauty is making tabloid headlines for her apparent troubled relationship with her", "site": "@theinquisitr", "creator": "@theinquisitr"}, "generator": "WP Rocket 3.18.3"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1485466920.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
