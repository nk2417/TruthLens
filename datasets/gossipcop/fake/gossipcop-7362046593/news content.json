They are already annoying me!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen u realize that it\u2019s going to be a long season of The Voice if Blake and Gwen keep flirting every 5 seconds #TheVoice,\u201d Twitter user @makennaacypert wrote on the 140-character site during The Voice\u2019s Season 12 premiere, alongside photos showing her turning off the show after seeing Shelton and Stefani\u2019s gushing interactions.\n\n\u201c@NBCTheVoice I wish the show was focused more on the talent than Gwen & Blake #annoying #TheVoice #ImOverIt #verydisappointing,\u201d The Voice viewer @NicolFranz69 tweeted of Stefani\u2019s flirty interactions with her boyfriend, while @riitaloretta wrote on the social media site during the premiere episode, \u201cGwen is so annoying on #thevoice. She legit brings up her relationship [with] Blake every 5 seconds.\u201d\n\n\u201cGwen and Blake are nauseating,\u201d The Voice fan @alleb35 then added as Shelton and Stefani showed off their flirting and romance, \u201cand I\u2019m gonna turn the show off.\u201d\n\nGwen Stefani and Blake Shelton\u2019s romance, which began after they met on the show in 2015, was on full display on the February 27 premiere episode of The Voice , as Entertainment Tonight reported that the couple\u2019s co-coach Adam Levine even commented that being in the middle of Shelton and Stefani made him a little uncomfortable amid allegations Stefani\u2019s return supposedly hasn\u2019t exactly been championed by The Voice crew.\n\nAfter both Gwen and Adam pushed their buttons for a contestant, Blake made it pretty clear that he wanted to see the singer head to Stefani\u2019s team, urging him to say yes to Gwen and not his longtime co-coach Adam.\n\n\u201cWhen they both push, because they\u2019re dating, sometimes I feel like a third wheel in this thing,\u201d Levine then admitted of the awkward moment after Shelton and Stefani made it pretty clear that they aren\u2019t going to be hiding their romance on Season 12 of The Voice like they have in past seasons.\n\nThe site then noted that Gwen also headed over and sat on Blake\u2019s lap during the episode after once again bringing up the fact that she and Shelton are dating by calling the singer her \u201cboyfriend\u201d and telling a contestant that she could \u201cuse her connections to her boyfriend to help them navigate the world of country music\u201d after they revealed their dreams to become a country star.\n\nYahoo! also reported that Stefani and Shelton\u2019s romance was on full display on The Voice opener, confirming that Gwen sat on Blake\u2019s lap more than once during the episode to show her affection for the country star, much to Levine\u2019s dismay.\n\n\u201cWhat happened to you, Blake? Are you okay?\u201d Levine jokingly asked Shelton during the flirty episode with Stefani.\n\nWhat did you think of Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani showing off their romance on the show? Was their PDA and flirting sweet or too much for The Voice Season 12 premiere?\n\n[Featured Image by Rachel Murray/Getty Images for Glamour ]", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2421769f-57a4-4bff-913f-cf316747493e.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20157'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/673ddaf526e964d15376329334d8a5b2?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20492%20142'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo-white.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent-Dark-Mode.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20120%20120'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-the-voice-season-12-premiere-flirting-pda-leaves-fans-unimpressed", "title": "Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton\u2019s \u2018The Voice\u2019 Flirting Leaves Fans Unimpressed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.png", "description": "Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton returned to TV screens for Season 12 of The Voice on February 27, but their on-set flirting had fans threatening to turn off.", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton\u2019s \u2018The Voice\u2019 Flirting Leaves Fans Unimpressed - Inquisitr News", "description": "Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton returned to TV screens for Season 12 of The Voice on February 27, but their on-set flirting had fans threatening to turn off.", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-the-voice-season-12-premiere-flirting-pda-leaves-fans-unimpressed", "site_name": "Inquisitr News"}, "article": {"tag": "The Voice", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-02-28T07:08:00-05:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton\u2019s \u2018The Voice\u2019 Flirting Leaves Fans Unimpressed - Inquisitr News", "description": "Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton returned to TV screens for Season 12 of The Voice on February 27, but their on-set flirting had fans threatening to turn off.", "site": "@theinquisitr", "creator": "@theinquisitr"}, "generator": "WP Rocket 3.18.3"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488283680.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
