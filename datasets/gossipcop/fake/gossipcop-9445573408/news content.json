Anna Faris, 40, sure didn\u2019t waste any time moving from husband of eight years Chris Pratt, 38. The Mom star is now dating her Overboard reboot cinematographer Michael Barrett, 47, who she worked with last winter. Now the Guardians of the Galaxy superstar is wondering if their romance started building before the Hollywood\u2019s cutest couple announced their separation on Aug. 6. \u201cChris is having a difficult time trying to figure out the timing of Anna\u2019s new relationship with Mike. Chris knows Anna met him a while ago, but when they may have started hooking up, Chris doesn\u2019t really want to think about. It is too painful,\u201d a source close to the actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cThe last few months have been really hard on Chris. He doesn\u2019t know what really happened with Anna or how exactly things fell apart, but they did. One thing he is certain of is that he is still very heartbroken. He thought he was going to be with Anna forever and now that is not happening,\u201d our insider adds. Anna moved on FAST, as TMZ reported on Oct. 18 that just a month after her split from Chris, she was seen canoodling with Michael at Malibu\u2019s famous Neptune\u2019s Net roadside diner in September. Click here for pics of Chris and Anna in happier times.\n\nAnna and Michael have been out on several dates at the same Pacific Palisades restaurant over the past week, and as we EXCLUSIVELY told you, she is way into him. \u201cAnna and Michael were incredibly close and cozy with each other. They were very incognito and kept a pretty low profile. She was really at ease with him and looked comfortable around him almost like they had gone on many dates before. Anna laughed a lot and always had a smile on her face,\u201d a source told us about their Palisades date. \u201cShe was glowing while they sat on the patio and ate dinner and it absolutely looked like they were on a date. He was very much into her and they shared a bottle of wine. He was a consummate gentleman as he even scooped her food into her to-go box for her. It was really cute.\u201d Poor Chris! He\u2019s still hurting over their marriage going south to date anyone new.\n\nHollywoodLifers, are you shocked Anna was the first one to move on from the relationship?", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/take-me-home-tonight.jpg?fit=440%2C293", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chris-pratt-everwood-2006.jpg?fit=293%2C440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/scary-movie-anna-farris.jpg?fit=440%2C293", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/chris-pratt-heartbroken-over-anna-faris-new-relationship-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C349", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/chris-pratt-heartbroken-over-anna-faris-new-relationship-ftr.jpg?resize=384%2C216"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/chris-pratt-heartbroken-over-anna-faris-new-relationship-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C349", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/19/chris-pratt-anna-faris-dating-michael-barrett-sad-relationship/", "title": "Chris Pratt \u2018Heartbroken\u2019 Over Anna Faris\u2019 New Romance With Michael Barrett \u2014 \u2018It\u2019s Painful\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Chris Pratt is heartbroken and devastated that his ex Anna Faris has moved on to new boyfriend Michael Barrett just months after their split.", "google-site-verification": "Atm19DlLsEdntyQvdD3b8sMiONm67k-Es2Ds9GrBCvU", "news_keywords": "Anna Faris, Chris Pratt", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "amp-consent-blocking": "amp-ad,amp-iframe", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.7", "auto-social": "always", "author": "Beth Shilliday", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Chris Pratt \u2018Heartbroken\u2019 Over Anna Faris\u2019 New Romance With Michael Barrett \u2014 \u2018It\u2019s Painful\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/19/chris-pratt-anna-faris-dating-michael-barrett-sad-relationship/", "description": "Anna Faris shocked the world \u2014 as well as ex Chris Pratt \u2014 by moving on with a new boyfriend, her \u2018Overboard\u2019 cinematographer Michael Barrett.
