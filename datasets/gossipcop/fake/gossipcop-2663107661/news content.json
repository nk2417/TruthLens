The news was confirmed with an engagement announcement placed in The Times of London on Wednesday.\n\nThe announcement reads: \u201cThe engagement is announced between Kit, younger son of David and Deborah Harington of Worcestershire, and Rose, middle daughter of Sebastian and Candy Leslie of Aberdeenshire.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s going to be a Game of Thrones wedding pic.twitter.com/8UGGMCh9GH \u2014 Elliot Wagland (@elliotwagland) September 27, 2017\n\nThe couple first sparked rumors about their offscreen romance in 2012 when they were spotted having a dinner date in London. Leslie, 30, and Harington, 30, reportedly split a year later, before getting back together in 2014.\n\nThe duo didn\u2019t make their first public appearance together as a couple until the Olivier Awards in London in 2016. Harington opened up about falling in love with Leslie during an interview with L\u2019Uomo Vogue, saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love.\u201d\n\nIn June, Harington revealed that he had moved in with Leslie during his appearance on CBS\u2019 The Late Late Show With James Corden.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve moved in with my other best friend, Rose,\u201d said Harington. \u201cSo, I\u2019m very. very happy and it\u2019s going well. She has all sorts of ideas for the house. I said to her, because she moved into my house, \u2018Look, darling, this is important that it\u2019s our space, that it feels like our space and that you haven\u2019t just moved into mine. Move anything you want around \u2014 change anything or chuck anything out.\u2019 \u201c\n\nCongrats to the couple!\n\n7:15 a.m. Wednesday, Sept. 27: Updated with newspaper announcement.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/d1086824-4618-4ec3-aaf7-96ff4c4ac695.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/d1086824-4618-4ec3-aaf7-96ff4c4ac695.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thr Staff", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/kit-harington-rose-leslie-are-engaged-report-1043209/", "title": "\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Co-Stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie Are Engaged", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Wedding bells are coming.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "THR Staff", "tags": "Kit Harington, Style News", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Co-Stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie Are Engaged", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/kit-harington-rose-leslie-are-engaged-report-1043209/", "description": "Wedding bells are coming.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/d1086824-4618-4ec3-aaf7-96ff4c4ac695.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "Kit Harington and Rose Leslie Are Engaged (Report)"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-26T13:38:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-09-27T12:00:32+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Wedding bells are coming.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Co-Stars Kit Harington and Rose Leslie Are Engaged", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/d1086824-4618-4ec3-aaf7-96ff4c4ac695.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/EGdC9QHPuvU"], "publish_date": 1506433099.0, "source": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
