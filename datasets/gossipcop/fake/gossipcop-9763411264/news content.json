But earlier, the 22-year-old slipped into a hospital gown after suffering a bad reaction to a vitamin IV drip, according to a Blast report published Tuesday, March 6.\n\nSources close to the model told the outlet that she was getting ready for her Oscar weekend appearances when she tried the health fad that is supposed to make skin glow. But things didn\u2019t go according to plan and Jenner checked into Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Beverly Hills, where she received treatment. Per the Blast, she was released a short time later.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Health Scares Trista Sutter, Selena Gomez, Ellen DeGeneres and more stars have opened up about their unexpected illnesses and injuries \u2014 read more\n\nThis isn\u2019t Jenner\u2019s first health scare. She previously struggled with sleep paralysis, a condition that causes temporary inability to move or speak while falling sleep or upon waking.\n\n\u201cI wake up in the middle of the night and I can\u2019t move,\u201d the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star revealed in a November 2016 episode of the E! series. \u201cI\u2019m freaking out.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars Who\u2019ve Battled Mental Health Issues Demi Lovato, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Jon Hamm, Carrie Fisher, and Ashley Judd are among the many celebrities who've admitted to struggling with depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder\n\n\u201cEveryone says I\u2019m fine, but I don\u2019t feel fine,\u201d she told her mother, Kris Jenner, on the show.\n\nKendall also suffers from trypophobia, the fear of irregular patterns or small holes.\n\n\u201cTrypophobics are afraid of tiny little holes that are in weird patterns,\u201d she shared on her app in August 2016. \u201cThings that could set me off are pancakes, honeycomb or lotus heads (the worst!) it sounds ridiculous but so many people actually have it! I can\u2019t even look at little holes \u2014 it give me the worst anxiety.
