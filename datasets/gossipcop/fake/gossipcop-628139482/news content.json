The ongoing denials by each star certainly had the masses scratching their heads seeing as the duo were often seen in one another\u2019s company on getaways and at various locales in Los Angeles.\n\nReasons for Katie and Jamie not going public earlier are rumored to be due to a contract that was signed by Holmes during her swift divorce proceedings with her ex-husband Tom Cruise. The contract was said to have included a five-year dating clause which meant that the Dawson\u2019s Creek star was not allowed to date publicly for this duration. Well, that was back in 2012, so the five years are up, which leads onlookers to believe that the contract was a real binding agreement.\n\nAdditional claims, since Jamie and Katie were spotted walking in Malibu holding hands, have been made regarding Cruise\u2019s reaction to his ex and former co-star coming clean about their relationship. The action star is reportedly \u201cfurious\u201d and \u201cenvious\u201d about the relationship between Holmes and Foxx and feels a sense of betrayal over it all, as International Business Times states.\n\nA said source indicates that Tom is bothered by the romance and that \u201cKatie is so happy with someone else,\u201d adding that \u201cTom would love to find his own true love, someone he can share the rest of his life with too. \u201d\n\n\u2018Katie Holmes finally goes public with new man Jamie Foxx, I\u2019m questioning why she ever agreed to marry Tom Cruise\u2019 https://t.co/NWx1Ogo3ml \u2014 The Sun (@TheSun) September 10, 2017\n\nIt\u2019s been no secret that Cruise\u2019s relationship with the Church of Scientology has caused both of his marriages to fail and if the star is to find love again, it must be with the approval of the faith. As for Tom being \u201cfurious,\u201d this seems a bit far-fetched seeing as the actor was snapped looking as happy as can be, even after news broke that Katie and Jamie are, in fact, an item.\n\nTom Cruise is pictured for the first time since ex-wife Katie Holmes confirmed her relationship with Jamie Foxx https://t.co/BqKD4cDrxm \u2014 Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) September 6, 2017\n\nAs The Sun indicated, Cruise recently landed in London and fans awaiting the Hollywood heartthrob were greeted with an ear-to-ear smile from Tom, who also gave an enthusiastic thumbs up. The actor had recently been injured while filming the latest installment for the Mission Impossible franchise, yet looked much better and entirely unaffected by the Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx reveal.\n\n[Featured Image by Andrew H.
