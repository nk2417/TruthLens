Kings.\n\nAnother said :\u201dRihanna, Drake, Katy, Ariana, Kendrick, Zayn, Nicki etc. all unfollowed Kanye \ud83d\udc80 he really ended himself :(.\u201d\n\nWhile a third added: \u201cKhloe, Kylie and Kourtney all unfollowed Kanye. Kris working hard today.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/scammerswift/status/989250552172195841\n\nhttps://twitter.com/simpIefuckery/status/989253828339011585\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Xtina_Baby_Jane/status/989253917337882626\n\nhttps://twitter.com/passionlyfruit/status/989242488337584128\n\nKanye proved his bromance with Donald Trump is still going strong yesterday in a series of tweets.\n\nCalling Trump \u201cmy brother,\u201d he claimed they both have \u201cdragon energy\u201d. The President replied saying the rapper was \u201cvery cool\u201d.\n\nTheir most recent display of affection follows years of social media appreciation between Trump and the President.\n\nThe loved-up posts were rumoured to have cost the rapper nine million Twitter follows, but the claims have been proved false after Twitter confirmed Kanye still boasts around 27million followers.\n\nKanye, 40, tweeted: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with Trump but the mob can\u2019t make me not love him.\u201d\n\nHe also shared a picture of a Make America Great Again cap and wrote: \u201cMy MAGA hat is signed\u201d, followed by a string of fire emojis.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/989222392630202368\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/989179757651574784\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/989227154993963009\n\nKanye\u2019s wife Kim Kardashian defended her husband by tweeting: \u201cTo the media trying to demonise my husband let me just say this\u2026 your commentary on Kanye being erratic & his tweets being disturbing is actually scary.\n\n\u201cSo quick to label him as having mental health issues for just being himself when he has always been expressive is not fair.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/989180180659777536\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/989192498307219456\n\nThe rapper also took potshots at Obama during the tweeting flurry, stating that nothing changed in Chicago during his presidency.\n\nCombating backlash from anti-Trump protesters he also shared a picture of a post by Chance The Rapper which read: \u201cBlack people don\u2019t have to be Democrats.\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/989272340432240641\n\nKanye continued that he loved free thinkers and showed alt-right supporter Peter Thiel.\n\nThe dad-of-three tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m so happy to hear that Peter Thiel would like to take a meeting. I feel very optimistic about the future.\u201d\n\nThiel is a controversial figure in American politics as he backs the alt-right and funded the Hulk Hogan case against Gawker Media for publishing a video of Hogan having sex.\n\nThe case saw an injunction placed on the footage being published and saw the media firm go bankrupt before being sold to another company.\n\nA fan noticed Kanye\u2019s following seemed to have fallen after the series of Trump-loving tweets and wrote: \u201cKanye losing 9 million followers because of the Trump tweet.\u201d\n\nBut Twitter confirmed to The Verge: \u201cWe can confirm that Kanye\u2019s follower count is currently at approximately 27M followers.\n\n\u201cAny fluctuation that people might be seeing is an inconsistency and should be resolved soon.\u201d\n\nThe College Dropout MC has never hidden his admiration for Donald Trump, turning up at Trump Tower the day after the 2016 election and posing for pictures in the lobby.\n\nKanye has even hinted he could run for President in 2024, saying: \u201cKeep America Great #Kanye2024\u201d.\n\nHe even once joked: \u201cWhen we become president we have to change the name of the plane from Air Force one to Yeezy force one\u201d.\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220.\n\nWe pay for videos too.
