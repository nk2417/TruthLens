Credit: Photo by Marco Torres\n\n\n\nThe 4:44 Tour\n\nJay-Z, Vic Mensa\n\nToyota Center\n\nNovember 8, 2017\n\nExpecting Jay-Z to be defiant, even at 47 is akin to asking a known superstar to go out and score 30 on a given night. It\u2019s what Jay-Z does. It\u2019s what he has done for the better part of two decades, both on stage and in music.\n\nThe 4:44 Tour, his latest North American light jog through the classics offers, maybe for the first time, a bit of bite and added emphasis to prove something to the world. There have been numerous reports of the tour not selling out, that it isn\u2019t meeting expectations or worse, is an abject failure solely because you can find a few decent seats on Groupon or a third-party reseller. None of those issues came into Toyota Center on Wednesday night. Well, there was the moment where Hov caught a glimpse of a man who brought his dog to the concert, but we need to build up to that moment first.\n\nJay-Z performed 29 songs on Wednesday, which allowed for 29 different thoughts to run through my head at any given moment. Instead of fully recapping how Jay-Z, one of music\u2019s interesting yet straightforward best live performers managed to captivate an audience for damn near two hours, I\u2019ll jog through 15 separate thoughts I had during the set.\n\nTHOUGHT ONE: Jay-Z really can\u2019t grow a proper mustache. There\u2019s a rule in life that you can\u2019t trust anyone who can\u2019t grow facial hair, and somehow Jay-Z fits that bill and yet he doesn\u2019t. Somebody trusted Jay-Z with 92 bricks, and he lost them, but somehow he didn\u2019t die of it which makes him close to immortal. Or a Highlander.\n\nTHOUGHT TWO: \u201cKill Jay-Z\u201d is a perfect tone-setter for this show. One, because four revolving boards are showing old Jay-Z videos and each of the still frames are getting set on fire. All of the doom and gloom, breaking up with Kanye, loving Blue and Beyonce plays out on these boards. FYI, he still loves Kanye to death and if I were a betting man, \u201cOtis\u201d and \u201cRunaway\u201d are Jay-Z\u2019s two favorite Kanye West videos.\n\nTHOUGHT THREE: LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers showed up, ahead of their scheduled matchup with the Rockets on Thursday. Does Jay go harder when LeBron\u2019s in attendance? Cause he went super hard on stage, almost as if he were still dissing Deshawn Stevenson and Soulja Boy on behalf of the NBA\u2019s best player.\n\nTHOUGHT FOUR: Yes, that was a thing that happened in 2007. Jay-Z is as petty as I am when it comes to friends and that makes him a super best friend unless you cross him.\n\nTHOUGHT FIVE: Is it customary that when you go to a Jay-Z show, you have to wear a Yankees fitted? Or that you have to break out your Timbaland boots? Scratch that, when the weather gets anywhere near 59 degrees in Houston, those Timbs are coming out.\n\nTHOUGHT SIX: Jay-Z has maybe three distinct national anthem style records. Those are the significant arena records that are gritty as hell and separate real Jay-Z fans from the guys who latched on with \u201cEmpire State of Mind.\u201d \u201cPSA\u201d from 2003\u2019s The Black Album? A definite national anthem. \u201cU Don\u2019t Know\u201d from 2001\u2019s The Blueprint? A full-on national anthem with a simple refrain: \u201cI will not lose, ever.\u201d The third is \u201cRun This Town\u201d from 2009\u2019s The Blueprint 3. The build-up to that song immediately makes you believe you could take on Andre The Giant with your bare hands and survive. All three were performed, almost in near succession to one another.\n\nTHOUGHT SEVEN: When Jay-Z feels like really getting excited, he makes sure the crowd lights are blood red. You know he\u2019s performing the entire song when the lights go red.\n\nTHOUGHT EIGHT: Thank God he cut \u201cForever Young\u201d out of this setlist. It\u2019s a cheesy closer. \u201cNumb / Encore\u201d in honor of the late Chester Bennington? A perfect closer. Never go \u201cForever Young.\u201d\n\nTHOUGHT NINE: Hearing \u201cAllure,\u201d his goodbye to the drug game song from The Black Album mixed in with a verse from \u201cDead Presidents II,\u201d one of his favorite hustler records is a top 5 Jay-Z concert moment for me, and I don\u2019t care who says otherwise. Fight the guy who messed over your chopped cheese sandwich.\n\nTHOUGHT TEN: There are zero guests for the 4:44 Tour. It\u2019s mostly Jay-Z, in a one-person show getting a lot of feelings off his chest. Even the cues where you\u2019d think a guest would show up like Bun B for \u201cBig Pimpin\u201d or Beyonc\u00e9 just to send people on a higher level for \u201cFamily Feud\u201d were absent. It was a man, on a self-created mountain, performing with a band underneath him.\n\nTHOUGHT ELEVEN: \u201c4:44\u201d as a song is a demonstrative exercise. There\u2019s so much to unpack it outside of Jay admitting that he cheated and that he cannot perform the song while directly looking at the audience. The same guy who wrote songs about shooting his brother, selling drugs to his friends and leaving condoms in the baby seat of the mother that once dated his most significant rival (Nas) is scared to look a crowd in the eye and admitted he messed up. It\u2019s riveting theater.\n\nTHOUGHT TWELVE: You can\u2019t go to a Jay-Z show and not break out rap hands. It\u2019s an ordained right from watching Jay-Z perform for over 20 years. You know the mannerisms, you know how it\u2019s going to go, and you especially do that when it\u2019s time for your moment with your song, you\u2019re going to let out a roar and try to emulate the guy on stage. The biggest fear, however, with a Jay-Z show in 2017 is that you can apparently figure out who is a diehard Hov stan since 1996 and who caught on real late and is picky about their Jay-Z fandom. Don\u2019t trust people who are picky about their Jay-Z fandom. Don\u2019t believe the people who tug at their jackets a bit tight when you\u2019re rapping \u201cWhere I\u2019m From\u201d or \u201cLucifer\u201d or the Hov deep cuts. Don\u2019t trust people who think that \u201c.38 revolve like the sun around the Earth\u201d line from \u201cIt\u2019s Hot\u201d is fantastic. Why? Because a real Jay-Z fan will tell you that line was terrible, that\u2019s why.\n\nTHOUGHT THIRTEEN: Right before \u201c99 Problems,\u201d Jay-Z singled out a guy who decided to make history. Jay-Z has seen plenty of shows and tours in his life. He\u2019s never seen someone bring a dog, without headphones (!) to a concert of his. \u201cI want to see him recognized and shouted out for his dedication,\u201d Hov said. No one decided to ask why the man brought his dog, or how he even got the dog past Toyota Center security. We just know the dog, and the man were there. About as random as the man who dressed in full Astros regalia at the parade crowd surfing.\n\nTHOUGHT FOURTEEN: A catalog as dense as Jay\u2019s would lead to a few questionable moments on the setlist. Somehow, he spread out the list to touch nearly every era of his career. There were Black Album cuts I thought he would never perform live again (\u201cAllure\u201d). There was even an emphasis on some of his Magna Carta Holy Grail work with \u201cBeach Is Better,\u201d though I\u2019m sure it was tossed in there for the Beyonc\u00e9 line alone, this being Houston after all. The one weird quirk? \u201c99 Problems\u201d was the only song that had closed-captioned for the hearing impaired. Did Jay-Z individually do this because he wanted everyone in the audience to get his point? Did he do this specifically for the guy who brought his dog? We need answers.\n\n\n\nTHOUGHT FIFTEEN: Meek Mill is on Jay-Z\u2019s mind. Tuesday night in Dallas, he spoke out about the Philadelphia rapper\u2019s latest incarceration due to riding a dirt bike in New York City. The judge considered it a probation violation since riding dirt bikes in NYC is illegal and sentenced Meek to serve two to four years in state prison in Pennsylvania. \u201cHe\u2019s been on probation for 11 years,\u201d Hov said to the shock of the crowd. \u201cIf that ain\u2019t modern day slavery and fuckery, I don\u2019t know what is. I\u2019m not talking about a black and white issue; I\u2019m talking about a human issue.\u201d Human issues are paramount these days, and with Hov, every problem becomes more considerable to speak on. The prison-industrial complex, mental health, therapy? All of it is big. Jay-Z is like Ric Flair in that way. On stage and in front of a camera? He\u2019s Jay-Z. When he\u2019s off it? He\u2019s Shawn Carter, still trying to navigate these spaces where Jay-Z would be comfortable.\n\nIt\u2019s a Comfy Hov world now.\n\n\n\nSO HOW ABOUT THE OPENER: When I spoke to Vic Mensa ahead of this show, he told me that performing a record like \u201cWe Could Be Free\u201d made him get lost in the lyrics and the message. As he prepared himself to kick off the 4:44 Tour, he kept that word in mind.\n\nMensa\u2019s set uses that same circular stage that Jay-Z\u2019s does but the Chicago rapper condenses his movement far more than Hov does. Songs like \u201c16 Shots\u201d get reflective lights and Mensa clutching a mike stand as if the drums and bass are hitting him dead in the chest. In other moments, such as \u201cOMG,\u201d he stands at attention, and for a twist, he put Paul Wall\u2019s \u201cSittin Sidewayz\u201d and UGK and OutKast\u2019s \u201cInternational Players Anthem\u201d underneath him to make him lift higher.\n\nClad in a jacket that was half-denim, half tribute to Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cRock With You\u201d video, Mensa used up a solid 30 minutes to tell his story. There were the three sides to a story narrative of \u201cHeaven On Earth,\u201d where he discussed his friend getting killed through his eyes, the eyes of his killer and the eyes of his friend wishing him success. He discussed losing love with \u201cHomewrecker\u201d and made sure to dedicate \u201cWe Could Be Free\u201d to those who lost their lives to police violence and also to the 26 men, women and children who lost their lives in Sutherland Springs last Sunday. Everything was on Mensa\u2019s mind on Wednesday, and in a controlled fury, all of his thoughts spilled out. For a kicker? Malik Yusef, the Chicago poet, decided to go all-in on a poem celebrating Houston\u2019s triumph through the pain following Hurricane Harvey and the Astros winning the World Series.\n\nBefore Toyota Center became a home game for Jay-Z, it felt like a home away from home for Vic Mensa too.\n\nPERSONAL BIAS: Jay-Z has learned from Kanye in how to make a stage design a big damn deal in a one-man rap show.\n\nTHE CROWD: There are your reformed dope boys who took their ladies out. There were the women who didn\u2019t mind the cold to show off and show out. There were Astros jerseys and hats everywhere, the city still awash in the pride of a championship touching this city\u2019s lips for the first time in two decades. It was half-date night, half-stunt night in Toyota Center. Which is probably the only way a Jay-Z concert in 2017 can go.\n\nOVERHEARD IN THE CROWD: \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t like the Yankees!\u201d\n\nRANDOM NOTEBOOK DUMP: Moments after the show ended and the drive home began, I realized that all of the talks about the tour being a failure due to it not being as in-demand a show was bull. There\u2019s no way you can have a bad show with your favorite artist unless that artist is late as hell or skips out with plenty of time left on the clock. Jay-Z could have gone until 1 performing the hits and nobody would have minded. Well, except those who had to work the next morning.\n\nVIC MENSA SETLIST\n\nDidn\u2019t I (Say I Didn\u2019t)\n\nU Mad\n\nMemories On 47th St.\n\n16 Shots\n\nHomewrecker\n\nRollin\u2019 Like a
