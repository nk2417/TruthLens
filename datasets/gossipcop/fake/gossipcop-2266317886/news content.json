Dancing With the Stars will return for its 22nd season with Len Goodman back where he belongs, Bindi Irwin as the reigning champ, and a baby boy or girl for Allison Holker.

(In case you missed it, you can read our recap of the best and worst moments here.)\n\nAlmost an hour after Tom Bergeron declared Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough the winners of season 21, Bindi was still in disbelief, shouting from the top of her lungs, \"I think I'm going to scream for 20 minutes!\" Her exuberance and genuine nature endeared her to literally every one on set, but no one more so than Derek. \"It's just so special with Bindi,\" he told reporters backstage. \"She's a champion of life.\"\n\nBindi shared the same sentiment, telling those in the ballroom that she gained another brother in Derek. In case you needed further proof that the two are friends for life, consider this: Derek's hopping on a plane to Australia in a couple weeks \"to tackle crocodiles and get my official khakis!\"\n\nThe Houghster may have nabbed his sixth Mirrorball trophy, but it was his partnership with Bindi that undoubtedly made it his favorite season. \"There's not a thing I would change about this season,\" he told Glamour post-show. \"There's not a week I would change, a dance I would change, and that was a very calming, very peaceful feeling. The show is a completely different show than the first time I won, and to win at this level and the standard that this show has been raised to, it's been incredible.\"", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/69052529366d881dc56a84ca/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690130491e26b96538751967/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6903b5c553adbbd18445744c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/69020b93d026e28178c5745e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68e7f043f314a34ac78dfaf9/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68fac442f289c13dd3caac6a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5695c45593ef4b09520eb27b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/entertainment-2015-11-sharna-burgess-nick-carter-dwts-finals-main.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/glamour-banner-v2.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5695c45516d0dc3747edf048/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/entertainment-2015-11-bc-jean-mark-ballas-dwts-main.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691632c189abfa806f00d037/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690e460e839f3ecee7a0b476/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68d748296ae85e2583754946/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5695c456d9dab9ff41b432d0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/entertainment-2015-11-derek-hough-bindi-irwin-dwts-finals-main.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5695c45516d0dc3747edf045/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/entertainment-2015-11-allison-holker-dwts-pregnant-main.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5695c455d9dab9ff41b432cc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/entertainment-2015-11-alek-skarlatos-lindsay-arnold-dwts-finals-main.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/636d76354acdeaf03c789f16/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/logo-oneNav.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5695c45593ef4b09520eb27d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/entertainment-2015-11-derek-hough-bindi-irwin-dancing-with-the-stars-finale-main.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68fb156e9d115b2f29d7888f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5e4967dcc142f40008ca7346/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68ffc7015bf81677d282862a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5695c456d9dab9ff41b432d0/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/entertainment-2015-11-derek-hough-bindi-irwin-dwts-finals-main.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Radloff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/everything-that-happened-backs", "title": "Everything That Happened Backstage After Bindi Irwin and Derek Hough Won Dancing With the Stars", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Jessica Radloff", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Mark March 21, 2016 on your calendar.
