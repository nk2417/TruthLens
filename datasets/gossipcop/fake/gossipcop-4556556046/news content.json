He defined a lifestyle and ethos that lie at the heart of the Playboy brand, one of the most recognizable and enduring in history. He will be greatly missed by many, including his wife Crystal, my sister Christie and my brothers David and Marston, and all of us at Playboy Enterprises,\u201d said Cooper.\n\nHefner quickly rose to fame after the first issue of men\u2019s magazine Playboy published in December 1953, which featured a nude Marilyn Monroe.
