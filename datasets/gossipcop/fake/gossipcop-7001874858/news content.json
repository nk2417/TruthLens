She danced with Beyonce's mother Tina Knowles Lawson, CNN reported.\n\nSince leaving office in January 2017, former President Obama \"living his best life\" has been something of a theme, with fans of the Democrat enjoying pictures of him holidaying with businessman Richard Branson, traveling with wife Michelle, and generally appearing to have the time of his life.\n\nObama's latest outing comes
