Sad end to great show.\u201d\n\nSchwarzenegger tweeted back, \u201cYou should think about hiring a new joke writer and a fact checker.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nTrump hosted \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d since its inception in 2004. Schwarzenegger took over for Season 15 due to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and eventual election. Still, as Variety first reported, Trump retained his executive producer credit on the show. The NBC show has not yet been picked up for another season, with or without Schwarzenegger.\n\nOn Friday, Schwarzenegger blamed the show\u2019s poor ratings on Trump\u2019s continued involvement. \u201cWhen people found out that Trump was still involved as executive producer and was still receiving money from the show, then half the people [started] boycotting it,\u201d he said.\n\nWith Schwarzenegger as host, the show has struggled in the ratings, which Trump has dissed over Twitter and in person. In one recent instance in February, the president mocked Schwarzenegger at the National Prayer Breakfast. \u201cI want to just pray for Arnold if we can \u2014 for those ratings,\u201d he said.\n\nSchwarzenegger responded in a video posted to Twitter, \u201cHey Donald, I have a great idea: Why don\u2019t we switch jobs?\u201d\n\nJust hours before on Saturday morning, Trump had unleashed a series of tweets accusing Barack Obama of \u201cNixon/Watergate\u201d-level mismanagement, including wire tapping his phones during the election. \u201cThis is McCarthyism!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAn Obama spokes person later released a statement that said, \u201c\u2026 neither President Obama nor anyone any White House official ever order surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simple false.\u201d", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/trump-arnold.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/trump-arnold.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Seth Kelley", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/president-trump-arnold-schwarzenegger-apprentice-fired-1202002170/", "title": "President Trump Slams Arnold Schwarzenegger for Exiting \u2018The Apprentice\u2019: \u2018He Was Fired\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "President Donald Trump isn't letting Arnold Schwarzenegger have the last word over the \"New Celebrity Apprentice.\"", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Seth Kelley", "tags": "Arnold Schwarzenegger, Donald Trump, The Apprentice", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "President Trump Slams Arnold Schwarzenegger for Exiting \u2018The Apprentice\u2019: \u2018He Was Fired\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/president-trump-arnold-schwarzenegger-apprentice-fired-1202002170/", "description": "President Donald Trump isn't letting Arnold Schwarzenegger have the last word over the \"New Celebrity Apprentice.\"", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/trump-arnold.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Donald Trump Arnold Schwarzenegger"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-03-04T14:02:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-03-04T18:19:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "President Donald Trump isn't letting Arnold Schwarzenegger have the last word over the \"New Celebrity Apprentice.\"", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@SethMKelley", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "President Trump Slams Arnold Schwarzenegger for Exiting \u2018The Apprentice\u2019: \u2018He Was Fired\u2019", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/trump-arnold.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488636127.0, "source": "http://variety.com", "summary": ""}
