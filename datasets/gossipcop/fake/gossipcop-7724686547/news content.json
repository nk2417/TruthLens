He and Maroon 5\u2019s Levine were friends from childhood and Feldstein managed Maroon 5 from their inception, guiding the band as they became one of music\u2019s most successful and universally popular international touring acts with three Grammy Awards and 20 million albums sold worldwide.\n\nHe is a father to two children and was previously married twice, once to Francesca Eastwood in 2013, the daughter of Clint Eastwood. The marriage was annulled.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nA statement from the Feldstein family reads as follows:\n\nUnfortunately, last night Jordan called 911 for shortness of breath, when paramedics arrived it was determined he went into full cardiac arrest and passed away shortly thereafter.\n\nHis family asks for privacy during this difficult and unexpected time.\n\nIn lieu of food and flowers, the family will announce a charity in the coming weeks where memorial donations can be made in Jordan\u2019s name.\n\nLive Nation and Roc Nation, with whom CAM was strategically aligned, also released a statement.\n\nWe are deeply saddened by the sudden passing of Jordan Feldstein and extend our heartfelt condolences to his family and friends.

He will be missed by his Live Nation and Roc Nation family.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jordan-feldstein1.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jordan-feldstein1.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shirley Halperin", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/jordan-feldstein-maroon-5-manager-and-brother-jonah-hill-dead-1202648455/", "title": "Jordan Feldstein, Maroon 5 Manager and Brother of Jonah Hill, Dies at 40", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Jordan Feldstein, longtime manager of Maroon 5 and the brother of actor Jonah Hill, has died.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Shirley Halperin", "tags": "Iggy Azalea, Jonah Hill, Jordan Feldstein, Maroon 5", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jordan Feldstein, Maroon 5 Manager and Brother of Jonah Hill, Dies at 40", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/jordan-feldstein-maroon-5-manager-and-brother-jonah-hill-dead-1202648455/", "description": "Jordan Feldstein, longtime manager of Maroon 5 and the brother of actor Jonah Hill, has died.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jordan-feldstein1.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Jordan Feldstein"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-23T16:29:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-26T20:13:54+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jordan Feldstein, longtime manager of Maroon 5 and the brother of actor Jonah Hill, has died.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@shirleyhalperin", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jordan Feldstein, Maroon 5 Manager and Brother of Jonah Hill, Dies at 40", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/jordan-feldstein1.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514046590.0, "source": "http://variety.com", "summary": ""}
