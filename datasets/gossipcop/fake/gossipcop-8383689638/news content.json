Pitt was reportedly impressed by her performances in \"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\" and this year's \"Churchill.\"\n\nAs a series, \"Sweetbitter\" is a project run by director Richard Shephard, who won Director's Guild of America award and Emmy awards for his work on \"Ugly Betty\" and is also known for his work on \"Girls.\" Casting director Laura Rosenthal is finding actors for the rest of the roles, according to Deadline. Pitt does not seem to be involved with the project on a casting level.\n\nIn Touch cites what it says is a source close to Jolie and Pitt. The source reportedly says that Jolie is upset with the relationship.\n\n\"She's furious about Brad's interest in Ella and her being cast in 'Sweetbitter,'\" In Touch's source reportedly said. \"She absolutely hates that Brad is cavorting with someone who played the teenage version of her in a film.\"\n\nPurnell is credited as \"Teen Maleficent\" in \"Maleficent,\" where Jolie played the lead role. Pitt and Jolie separated in September 2016 and are negotiating a divorce agreement.\n\nAngelina Jolie.

Purnell also reportedly said, \"He's always been her No. 1 celebrity crush.\"\n\n\"He realizes the huge age difference ... and that everyone would look at the relationship as a midlife crisis mistake,\" In Touch's source reportedly said. \"[But] he's taken with Ella's spunky, funny demeanor and formidable acting skills.\"\n\nPurnell is already an accomplished actress in her own right. In the past few years, she's had roles in high-profile movies like \"Never Let Me Go,\" \"Kick-Ass 2,\" and \"The Legend of Tarzan.\"\n\nA representative for Pitt did not immediately respond to INSIDER's request for comment. Purnell's representative told us he had no official comment on the report.", "images": ["http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://i.insider.com/59e8cb05b0c29222aa5884ea?width=700", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "https://i.insider.com/5c0ac35c965aa0227e3fa9e8?width=168&format=jpeg&auto=webp&crop=1:1,smart", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://i.insider.com/59e8cb05b0c29222aa5884eb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/59e8cb05b0c29222aa5884eb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacob Shamsian", "Enter Your Email", "Follow Authors", "Never Miss A Story"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/brad-pitt-dating-ella-purnell-angelina-jolie-maleficent-2017-10", "title": "'Completely made up': Brad Pitt isn't dating the 21-year-old who played a teen version of Angelina Jolie in a movie, says source", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1208", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "'Completely made up': Brad Pitt isn't dating the 21-year-old who played a teen version of Angelina Jolie in a movie, says source", "datePublished": "2017-10-19T15:52:00.000Z", "dateModified": "2017-10-19T15:52:48.000Z", "news_keywords": "News, Celebrity, Relationship", "description": "A source tells INSIDER that reports that Ella Purnell, who played \"Teen Maleficent\" in one of Pitt's soon-to-be-ex-wife's most famous roles, are false.", "author": "Jacob Shamsian", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "tbi-vertical": "News", "og": {"title": "'Completely made up': Brad Pitt isn't dating the 21-year-old who played a teen version of Angelina Jolie in a movie, says source", "description": "A source tells INSIDER that reports that Ella Purnell, who played \"Teen Maleficent\" in one of Pitt's soon-to-be-ex-wife's most famous roles, are false.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/brad-pitt-dating-ella-purnell-angelina-jolie-maleficent-2017-10", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/59e8cb05b0c29222aa5884eb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@businessinsider"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"psvp": "c"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "59e8cb06b0c29222aa5884ec", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"sections": "News", "tags": "Page Type:story"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2025-05", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.thisisinsider.com", "summary": ""}
