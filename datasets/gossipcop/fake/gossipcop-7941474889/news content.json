And in a surprise new twist, it\u2019s believed Jen is already a long way through the process of adopting a baby \u2013 with Jen telling friends she \u2018can\u2019t wait\u2019 to have a family with Brad. The shock developments come as respected US website TMZ reveals that Jen and Justin may never have been married in the first place, making it easier for Jen to make her renewed romance with Brad official so soon.\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\n\u2018Jen and Brad are done with hiding and really wanted to do something major to show that they\u2019re together and are committed to making it work once and for all,\u2019 a source tells New Idea.\n\n\u2018They decided to walk down the aisle and have a commitment ceremony to one another with just their inner circle present.\u2019 While they didn\u2019t officially marry, friends say it felt like a wedding \u2013 cementing their dedication to one another after so many years apart and proving they\u2019re in it for the long haul. \u2018They spent time in Anguilla back during their first marriage and had lots of beautiful experiences \u2013 so it\u2019s only fitting that they wanted to go back there and create some new memories to cherish. \u2018The ceremony was on a small, quiet beach \u2013 Jen wore a simple white linen slip dress and no shoes, Brad wore white shorts and an open white shirt. She was clutching some flowers she\u2019d picked in the morning \u2013 it was very simple, but very intimate and special.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie (l), Justin Theroux and Justin Aniston (Credit: Getty)\n\n\u2018They\u2019re now back to calling one another husband and wife, and while their marriage might not be official in the eyes of the law, it\u2019s 100 per cent real to Brad and Jen. This was like their second wedding.\u2019 Also on everyone\u2019s lips were rumours that Brad and Jen are already working on adopting a baby, a dream for both. It\u2019s emerged that Jen started the adoption process while she was still with Justin \u2013 even though their relationship was dying, knowing that she wanted to have a baby even if they split. \u2018That\u2019s the reason she suddenly decided to separate from Justin,\u2019 a friend tells New Idea. \u2018The adoption process has reached a crucial stage and she doesn\u2019t want Justin to have any claim over her son. \u2018Brad is very excited about Jen\u2019s baby news \u2013 especially as he rarely gets to see his own kids anymore because of his custody battle with Ange.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a fairytale ending for Brad and Jen who sensationally split in 2005 after a five-year marriage. While fans have always hoped for \u2018Hollywood\u2019s Golden Couple\u2019 to reunite, it seemed an impossibility with the actor\u2019s high-profile marriage to Angelina Jolie, who\u2019s long been accused of breaking up Brad and Jen \u2013 and Jen\u2019s marriage to Justin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut with both relationships now over, Brad and Jen have seized the opportunity to make their second chance at love official.\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea \u2013 out now!", "images":
