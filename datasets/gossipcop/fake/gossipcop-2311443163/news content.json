friends that her marriage to rapper husband Kanye West is over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe thrice-married reality star, 37, has reportedly told those in her inner circle that she is leaving the rapper, 41, after four troubled years of marriage.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s over,\u2019 one insider told the US publication. \u2018She\u2019s realised he\u2019s not the man she fell in love with.\u2019\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\nAccording to the bombshell report, the final straw was an ugly fight that erupted after Kanye\u2019s recent off-the-wall tweets, including support of Donald Trump and referring to slavery as a \u2018choice\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018She called him out on his selfishness and how he doesn\u2019t ever think of the repercussions it could have for her brands,\u2019 an insider explosively tells. \u2018All he cares about is his music and clothing line.\u2019\n\n\u2018It was one of their worst fights ever.\u2019\n\nThe source outrageously adds that Kim is petrified to divorce a third time and potentially fight with Kanye over their shared $300 million fortune, but her desire to get out \u2018is greater than\u2019 her fear.\n\n\u2018Kim wants her old life back,\u2019 a source said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Credit: In Touch)\n\nIn Touch further claims that Kim has had enough of Kanye\u2019s erratic behaviour.\n\n\u2018Kim is a nervous wreck because she never knows what\u2019s around the corner when it comes to his actions,\u2019 a Kardashian insider said.\n\n\u2018She just can\u2019t take it anymore and stays at Kris\u2019 house with the kids.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple share three children \u2013 North, 5, Saint, 2, and Chicago, 8-months.\n\nKim knows the pain and humiliation of a public divorce all to well, still haunted by her 2011 divorce to NBA player Kris Humphries, which dragged on for nearly eight times the length of their 72-day marriage.\n\n\u2018The last thing Kim wants is a lengthy divorce,\u2019 a friend said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Kardashian family is yet to respond to In Touch\u2019s report.", "images":
