A pair of heirs?\n\nNope, royal experts tell PEOPLE. In fact, it\u2019s all a bit complicated.\n\nPHOTOS: Prince William & Kate Middleton\u2019s Pregnancy Clues in 5 Clicks\n\nThe firstborn twin would have a completely different path than his or her sibling, says royal historian Robert Lacey, author of The Queen: A Life in Brief: \u201cThe first child to appear will have precedence. Whichever one comes out first will be the heir \u2013 and it will be the call of the obstetrician if there is a caesarean section.\u201d\n\nAnd the obstetrician will make that delivery based on the location of the babies during labor, Mark Johnson, Professor of Obstetrics at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, tells PEOPLE.\n\nSays Johnson: \u201cIf delivering vaginally, the first baby to enter the pelvis will be delivered first. If delivering by c-section it very much depends on the which baby is closest to the incision, generally that will be the lower of the two babies.\u201d\n\nA year ago, the British government voted to modernize the rule of succession so that in the event of twins, a firstborn girl would not lose the title of heir if a boy were to be subsequently born to the royal couple. But that rule hasn\u2019t been implemented yet.\n\nUnder the current law of the land, says Lacey, \u201cIf the twins are a girl first followed by a boy, the boy will be next in succession.\u201d\n\nWhen or if the law is changed, adds Lacey, \u201cthe boy would be ousted by his sister.\u201d\n\nIf Kate is pregnant with twins, William, who will surely be present for the births, will be able to see firsthand which baby is born first. But in the past that wasn\u2019t the case, adds Lacey.\n\nIn other eras, \u201cthe Home Secretary was on hand in the hospital to ensure there was no foul play,\u201d says Lacey, \u201csince there were fears that if the firstborn turned out to be a girl, she might get swapped for a substitute baby boy \u2013 and smuggled into the bed in a warming pan.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Prince William and Kate\u2019s
