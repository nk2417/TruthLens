Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.\n\nBut wait \u2014 if that\u2019s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing \u2026 they\u2019re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his \u201cCountry Music Freaks\u201d trek.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton\u2019s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.\n\nAdditionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 \u2014 when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu \u2014 and shared his latest video, \u201cI Lived It\u201d with a glowing string of hashtags.\n\nSo if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch\u2018s \u201cinsider\u201d source, all of Stefani\u2019s social media support is \u201ca desperate attempt to ignore the truth,\u201d and Shelton dumped her due to her \u201cneediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nIf this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup \u2014 Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani\u2019s comfort \u2014 as well as Shelton\u2019s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is \u201csharing intimate details\u201d of his life.\n\nShelton isn\u2019t reciprocating Stefani\u2019s loving social media deluge \u2014 but then again, he\u2019s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MhuT_8_8AWquSPZF.0M4Tw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTQyODtoPTYwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d7f38f00-340b-11eb-b7bf-540525a865da", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_p_entertainmentv2_2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZS0lAnrak3wi9.1_9Ah.Wg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTQzNDtoPTYwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/4b8cb7d0-340b-11eb-bea5-b0fe8d35be73", "https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2018-03-15/6fa08450-2877-11e8-9ada-71817936d077_Screen-Shot-2018-03-15-at-1-33-55-PM.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/r7TlC2mJFKLo2H5KbhmZ6Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTgwO2g9ODA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/GLB/2017-10-14/5dc78060-b074-11e7-b188-9b54b0de6011_wendygeller.png"], "top_img": "https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2018-03-15/6fa08450-2877-11e8-9ada-71817936d077_Screen-Shot-2018-03-15-at-1-33-55-PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/gwen-stefanis-instagram-shuts-blake-shelton-breakup-rumors-165608305.html", "title": "How Gwen Stefani's Instagram shuts down Blake Shelton breakup rumors \u2014 over and over again", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "If the much-gossiped-about couple are actually history, why does Stefani's Instagram seem to prove otherwise?", "keywords": "Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "conf": {"cjs": {"consent-flow": "yguce", "locale": "en-US"}}, "oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Yahoo", "creator": "@Yahoo", "title": "How Gwen Stefani's Instagram shuts down Blake Shelton breakup rumors \u2014 over and over again", "description": "If the much-gossiped-about couple are actually history, why does Stefani's Instagram seem to prove otherwise?", "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2018-03-15/6fa08450-2877-11e8-9ada-71817936d077_Screen-Shot-2018-03-15-at-1-33-55-PM.png"}, "og": {"title": "How Gwen Stefani's Instagram shuts down Blake Shelton breakup rumors \u2014 over and over again", "description": "If the much-gossiped-about couple are actually history, why does Stefani's Instagram seem to prove otherwise?", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/gwen-stefanis-instagram-shuts-blake-shelton-breakup-rumors-165608305.html", "site_name": "Yahoo Entertainment", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2018-03-15/6fa08450-2877-11e8-9ada-71817936d077_Screen-Shot-2018-03-15-at-1-33-55-PM.png", "height": 590, "width": 596}, "type": "article"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842, "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=bca125e5-6029-363d-b937-74b77b447145&src=web"}, "android": {"app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo", "url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=bca125e5-6029-363d-b937-74b77b447145&src=web"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
