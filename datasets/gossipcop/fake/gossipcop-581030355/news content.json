So many kisses!!! X Exciting x #friendshipneverends #girlpower.\u201d\n\nWe can reveal that during the one hour, 15-minute meeting the Wannabe singers launched plans for their first TV series later this year.\n\nThey ate sushi, kissed and hugged, and shared stories about their kids.\n\nOur insider revealed: \u201cVictoria knows this is the last chance saloon for the Spice Girls, their last chance to get back into their hot pants.\n\n\u201cShe knows David is viewed as the showbiz force in their marriage and she is now a fashion businesswoman.\n\n\u201cBut she wants that to change and really embrace being back in the spotlight with the Spice Girls.\n\n\u201cFor many years, it\u2019s been Victoria who has put the block on the Spice Girls returning. But yesterday she was the most excited about it.\n\n\u201cFor the moment, she\u2019s still insisting on not singing, but Geri, Mel B and Emma are confident they can change her mind.\n\n\u201cMel C is nervous about the idea of a full-scale tour, but there could be some type of shows and perhaps even new music.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something no one in Spice world thought was possible even a few weeks ago.\n\n\u201cMel C was really wavering until the end but she\u2019s now come aboard with ideas of her own.\n\n\u201cThe meeting went incredibly well and the Spice Girls are now back together.\n\n\u201cInitially there was lots of reminiscing and then they started to talk about future plans.\n\n\u201cA tour isn\u2019t on the agenda right now, but there is hope that perhaps they could end up on stage together in some way.\n\n\u201cMel C is most nervous about big commitments, even more so than Victoria.\n\n\u201cThe most concrete plan is for a TV show this year, with the possibility of a series aimed at children.\n\n\u201cAll five of the girls were united in the fact that they want their children to be very heavily involved in the reunion.\u201d\n\nPop Idol creator and former Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller, 57, was also at the meeting.\n\nHe is expected to be put in charge of the reunion plans \u2014 which will net each member at least \u00a310million.\n\nThe Spice source said: \u201cSo 2018 is all about monetising the Spice Girls again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s what Fuller has done with Brand Beckham so they\u2019re confident if he\u2019s at the helm they will all \u00adseriously profit.\u201d\n\nThe Nineties favourites, who have had nine No1 hits, were originally due to meet at the five-star Connaught Hotel in London\u2019s Mayfair.\n\nThey changed venue at the last minute over fears they would be seen together. Fuller, who met with fashionista Posh and husband David, 42, the previous evening in London, was first to arrive at 12.15pm.\n\nHe was followed by Emma, at 12.20pm.\n\nMel C shocked onlookers by walking to Geri\u2019s house at 12.23pm in stark contrast to Victoria, who turned up at 12.20pm in the back of a blacked-out Mercedes.\n\nMel B, fresh from the airport, was last to arrive at 1.20pm. She was dropped off in a Volkswagen Golf.\n\nThe meeting was interrupted by a food delivery from Planet Organic and the arrival of Bluebell, Geri\u2019s nine-year-old daughter from school.\n\nIt is the first time the five singers have been in a room together since the opening of their flop musical Viva Forever! in December 2012.\n\nThe last time the Spice Girls performed as a five-piece was at the closing ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.\n\nFuller and Victoria were the first to depart yesterday at 3.30pm \u2014 followed by Baby Spice Emma. Mel C left minutes later, and stayed true to her Sporty Spice moniker by swerving a lift in favour of a walk.\n\nScary Spice Mel B was last to depart at 4.02pm, using her contacts to upgrade her transport to a silver blacked-out Mercedes.\n\nThe Spice Girls said in a joint statement: \u201cWe have enjoyed a wonderful afternoon catching up and reminiscing about the amazing times we have spent together.\n\n\u201cWe are always overwhelmed at how much interest there is across the whole world for The Spice Girls.\n\nThe time now feels right to explore some incredible new opportunities together.\n\n\u201cWe all agree that there are many exciting possibilities that will once again embrace the original essence of The Spice Girls, while reinforcing our message of female empowerment for future generations.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000382339344-e1517608040374.jpg?strip=all&w=960",
