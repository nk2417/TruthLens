Hot Pockets!\"\n\nSadly, most brides aren\u2019t big on punking their guests. Go figure.\n\nCarino, 48, is an agent at CAA, and despite counting Justin Bieber and Harry Styles among his A-list clients, he maintains a relatively low-profile and seems to enjoy the civilian life.\n\nWhich is good, because while there are occasional exceptions (Jay and Bey, Posh and Becks), there\u2019s generally only room for one superstar as big as Gaga in a marriage.", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/2552_D085_00216R-H-2025-80x80.webp", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1154615733-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/lady-gaga-in-black-with-tassels-692x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2159895990-6-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/kate-upton-is-so-pretty-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247300883-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/04/ramona-singer-in-black-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/lady-gaga-and-christian-corino-720x540.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_annaduggar_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1119_janellebrown_angelamoody_header-80x80.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/lady-gaga-and-christian-corino-775x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/69023040a27d084abe99b818-80x80.webp", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/lady-gaga-and-christian-corino.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1119_tekashi6ix9ine_header-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/christian-corino-1024x777.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/lady-gaga-and-christian-corino.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/02/lady-gaga-and-christian-carino-wedding-plans-revealed/", "title": "Lady Gaga & Christian Carino: Wedding Plans Revealed?!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lady Gaga & Christian Carino: Wedding Plans Revealed?!", "description": "Back in November, several media outlets (including this one) reported on the widespread rumor that Lady Gaga and Christian Carino are engaged.
