(Photo credit: Getty)\n\nDespite earlier reports that Eric Benet was \u2018thrilled\u2019 with Jay-Z name dropping him in new lyric, the singer reportedly turned up at the rappers house over the weekend demanding a fight.\n\nEric Benet may have reached a breaking point with Jay-Z and went looking for a fight with the rapper, who did throw some very direct shade at him on the first track of 4:44, according to a new MediaTakeOut.com report.\n\nJay made reference to Eric\u2019s alleged unfaithfulness to ex-wife, Halle Berry in Kill Jay-Z.\n\nEric Benet and ex-wife Halle Berry who allegedly cheated on (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThe rapper, real name Shawn Carter, raps: \u2018You almost went Eric Ben\u00e9t, let the baddest girl in the world get away / I don\u2019t even know what else to say, n**ga never go Eric Ben\u00e9t,\u2019\n\nSpeaking to USA Today at an airport on 30 June, Eric even joked about Jay-Z owing him some royalties for the name dropped\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like yo, bro, where are my royalties?\u2019\n\nAt the time, he didn\u2019t seem annoyed by the name drop, in fact he said it was \u2018all love\u2019.\n\nHe\u2019s also been said to say that \u2018it\u2019s all love\u2019. Is he upset or not? (Picture: FilmMagic)\n\nHe added: \u2018But it\u2019s all love\u2026everything he makes is always fire, and once again he did not disappoint. It\u2019s kind of unreal being mentioned in his lyrics, but like I said, it\u2019s all love\u2019\n\nBut according to these new reports from MediaTakeOut.com, Eric drove over to JAY-Z\u2019s Malibu mansion on 1 July and asked security to tell Jay to come outside and fight.\n\nAn insider allegedly said: \u2018Jay was inside enjoying his family. He doesn\u2019t have time for any of [Eric Benet\u2019s] nonsense.\u2019\n\nMetro.co.uk has reached out to representatives for both JAY-Z and Eric for a comment.\n\nArrow MORE: \u2018Where are my royalties!\u2019: Eric Ben\u00e9t wants his money for the epic name drop Jay-Z made on new album 4:44", "images": ["https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/618661194.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=646", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SEI_274900357-8592.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SEI_274020817-49fe-e1762939662516.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C1630px%2C919px&resize=320%2C180", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pri_45379255.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2223783239.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C594px%2C334px&resize=320%2C180", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lya1bgad.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=512&resize=200,200&zoom=1", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SEI_258054759-f78b-e1763583996133.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=646&h=363&crop=1", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SEC_274377047-239b.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SEI_274900357-8592.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=646&h=363&crop=1", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SEI_274304688-c54c.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=391px%2C103px%2C1079px%2C605px&resize=320%2C180", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pri_45379255.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=646", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SEI_274735792-17ad-e1763451553600.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C1883px%2C1059px&resize=320%2C180", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2269108.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=646", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/GettyImages-1078184650-3a25-e1755508123875.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C82px%2C2325px%2C1308px&resize=320%2C180", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SEC_274034859-3cfd.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SEI_273851168-ae5e-e1763490145792.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C2020px%2C1136px&resize=646%2C363", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/showbiz-katie-price.png?strip=true&quality=90", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SEI_268716166-00a6.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SEC_274657230-b1d1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=320&h=180&crop=1", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2202140335-e1763576177854.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C38px%2C3224px%2C1817px&resize=646%2C363"], "top_img": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pri_45379255.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tobi Akingbade"], "canonical_link": "https://metro.co.uk/2017/07/03/is-eric-benet-upset-with-jay-z-or-not-new-reports-claim-he-turned-up-at-hovs-house-for-a-fight-over-shady-lyrics-6751298/", "title": "Eric Benet 'confronted JAY-Z for a fight over 4:44 lyrics'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/client-mu-plugins/metro-branding/images/m-icon-black-270.png", "msvalidate.01": "AE7395BB35A71648216DC12EB230C308", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "ob": {"article": {"section": {"name": "Showbiz", "url": "https://metro.co.uk/entertainment/showbiz/"}}}, "sailthru.date": "2017-07-03 12:49:24", "sailthru.title": "Is Eric Benet upset with Jay-Z or not?
