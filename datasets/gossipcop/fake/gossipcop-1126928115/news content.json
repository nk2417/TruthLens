Unfortunately, that holds true of both human operatives and, in some cases, animal operatives, as well.\n\nIn 2008, Missouri Highway State Patrol officers Terry Mills and Jeff Heath were working with the FBI to infiltrate dogfighting rings with ties to \"domestic terror groups.\" The duo continued investigating the ring under their own agency, with the help of the Humane Society of Missouri. The realized to gain entry to that world, they would have to become active participants themselves. The pair bought, trained, and fought their own dogs, while wearing audio and video recording equipment, in order to gain admittance to the secretive, savage world of dogfighting.\n\nThanks to their lengthy - and bloody - investigation, a multi-agency task force raided dogfighting and breeding operations in eight states, resulting in the arrest of 26 dogfighters and the seizure of more than 500 pit bulls. The officers said putting dogs in fights was a decision that required \"grave discussion,\" but they knew their mission was just when Tim Rickey, the head of the Humane Society of Missouri's animal cruelty task force, gave them his support. \"For me, it was about doing the right thing,\" said Rickey.", "images": ["https://imgix.ranker.com/img/icons/chevronExpand.svg?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=png&dpr=4&h=13&w=71", "https://static.ranker.com/img/brand/ranker-logo.svg?v=1&auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=png&dpr=2&w=104", "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50066/1001307262/original/neo-nazi-investigation-reveals-racist-cop-photo-u2?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&w=500", "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/icons/voteDown.svg?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=png&dpr=4&h=44&w=44", "https://imgix.ranker.com/list_img_v2/8171/2548171/original/true-deep-undercover-cop-stories-u1?auto=format&q=50&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&h=356.020942408377&w=680", "https://v3api.ranker.com/api/px?lid=2548171", "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/icons/rankedByCaret.svg?v=5&auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=png&dpr=4&h=8.852&w=6.898", "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/icons/vote-on-pill.svg?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=png&dpr=4&h=24&w=105", "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50066/1001307168/original/faux-mobster-crushes-a-mafia-family-single-handedly-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&w=500", "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/icons/chevronRight.svg?auto=format&q=60&fit=clip&fm=png&dpr=4&h=23&w=15", "https://static.ranker.com/img/brand/wordmark.svg?v=1&auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=png&dpr=2&w=210", "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/icons/voteUp.svg?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=png&dpr=4&h=44&w=44", "https://imgix.ranker.com/img/brand/6/header/logo.png?fit=fill&fm=png&q=60&dpr=2&w=75&h=56?v=17", "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_img/5655/28272231/original/brent-sprecher-u6?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&h=40&w=40", "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50066/1001311150/original/cops-and-their-dogs-infiltrate-the-violent-world-of-dogfighting-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&w=500", "https://imgix.ranker.com/list_img_v2/8171/2548171/original/true-deep-undercover-cop-stories-u1?w=1200&h=630&fm=pjpg&q=80&fit=crop&dpr=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=10600724&cv=3.6&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://imgix.ranker.com/list_img_v2/8171/2548171/original/true-deep-undercover-cop-stories-u1?w=1200&h=630&fm=pjpg&q=80&fit=crop&dpr=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brent Sprecher"], "canonical_link": "https://www.ranker.com/list/true-deep-undercover-cop-stories/brent-sprecher", "title": "14 Insane Stories of Cops Who Went Deep Undercover For Years At A Time", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "p": {"domain_verify": "6bc9700ac759049b4fe292e21daf582a"}, "listid": 2548171, "twitter": {"site": "@ranker", "account_id": 1436986808, "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "14 Insane Stories of Cops Who Went Deep Undercover For Years At A Time", "description": "Over 100 fans have voted on the 14 Insane Stories of Cops Who Went Deep Undercover For Years At A Time.
