The New York Times and the New Yorker first published investigative pieces in 2017 that accused disgruntled movie producer Harvey Weinstein of decades of sexual assault and harassment. Soon after, Weinstein stood trial and was [\u2026]\n\n\u201cIn December of 2006, I embarked on my ninth USO Tour to entertain our troops, my eighth to the Middle East since the 9/11 attacks,\u201d Tweeden began in a blog post she wrote for the California radio station KABC, where she hosts a morning talk show. \u201cMy father served in Vietnam and my then-boyfriend (and now husband, Chris) is a pilot in the Air Force, so bringing a \u2018little piece of home\u2019 to servicemembers stationed far away from their families was both my passion and my privilege.\u201d\n\n\u201cFranken had written some skits for the show and brought props and costumes to go along with them,\u201d she continued. \u201cLike many USO shows before and since, the skits were full of sexual innuendo geared toward a young, male audience.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Most Influential Celebrities on Social Media Social media has allowed celebrities to directly communicate with fans over the years.

Then he said it again. I said something like, \u2018Relax Al, this isn\u2019t SNL\u2026we don\u2019t need to rehearse the kiss.\u2019 He continued to insist, and I was beginning to get uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nTweeden continued: \u201cHe repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said \u2018OK\u2019 so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth. I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn\u2019t be so nice about it the next time.\u201d\n\nThe sportscaster said she felt \u201cdisgusted and violated\u201d and when she performed the skit with Franken on stage, she turned her head so he couldn\u2019t kiss her on the lips again.\n\nTweeden wrote that on the way home from the tour later that year, she found a photo of Franken putting his hands on her breasts while she was sleeping.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Tweeden wrote. \u201cHe groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep. I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated. How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it\u2019s funny?\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars Speak Out Against Harvey Weinstein Amid Sexual Misconduct Scandal Channing Tatum, Laura Dern, Jane Fonda and more stars are speaking out against film producer Harvey Weinstein in the wake of his sexual misconduct scandal \u2014 read more\n\nFranken released a statement shortly after the accusations broke.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone else who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worked for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThere\u2019s more I want to say, but the first and most important thing \u2014 and if it\u2019s the only thing you care to hear, that\u2019s fine \u2014 is: I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI respect women,\u201d he continues. \u201cI don\u2019t respect men who don\u2019t. And the fact that my own actions have given people a good reason to doubt that makes me feel ashamed.\u201d\n\nFranken also added, \u201cWhile I don\u2019t remember the rehearsal for the skit as Leeann does, I understand why we need to listen to and believe women\u2019s experiences. I am asking that an ethics investigation be undertaken, and I will gladly cooperate.\u201d", "images":
