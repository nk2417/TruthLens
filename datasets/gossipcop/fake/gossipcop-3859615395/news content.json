She even included ex-wife Kris Jenner.\n\nRelated: Kardashian-Jenner Family\u2019s Biggest Controversies and Scandals All the drama! Over the years, the Kardashian-Jenner family has made headlines for the ups and downs that occurred in their personal and professional lives. Kim Kardashian\u2018s marriage to Kris Humphries went viral in 2011 after they called it quits 72 days after saying \u201cI do.\u201d Humphries filed for an annulment in November 2011, citing [\u2026]\n\n\u201cSo blessed to have so many amazing moms in my life!\u201d the 68-year-old Olympian gushed in her Instagram Stories on Sunday, May 13. Pictures included a never-before-seen image of daughter Kylie Jenner cradling her baby girl Stormi and a snap of Caitlyn hugging Kris. Though Caitlyn revealed in November 2017 that she hasn\u2019t spoken to Kim Kardashian in a year, she shared a selfie of herself with the reality star, 37, and grandson Saint.\n\nKhloe\u2019s social media snub comes after a February interview with U.K. morning show Lorraine, where she opened up about her estranged relationship with Caitlyn. When the then-pregnant 33-year-old was asked if having a child would mend her estranged relationship with Caitlyn, she replied: \u201cI don\u2019t think that affects anything with Caitlyn. Things are just as they are.\u201d (Khloe welcomed daughter, True, on April 12, with boyfriend Tristan Thompson.)\n\nRelated: The Kardashian Family: Get to Know the Next Generation While making their mark on the entertainment and business world, the Kardashian-Jenner clan is also raising their next generation. Kourtney Kardashian was the first of Kris Jenner\u2019s children to have kids of her own. Kourtney and her now-ex Scott Disick welcomed their eldest son, Mason, in December 2009, followed by daughter Penelope three years later. [\u2026]\n\nJenner\u2019s relationship with the Kardashian family has been rocky since April 2015 when she revealed her identity as a transgender woman. In her memoir, The Secrets of My Life, Caitlyn claimed that Kris, 62, was not supportive of her transition. Their divorce was finalized in 2015 after 24 years of marriage.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost all relationship with them, yes, I don\u2019t talk to any of them anymore,\u201d Caitlyn told Piers Morgan in 2017. At the time, the former athlete revealed she hadn\u2019t spoken to Khloe in two years.\n\nRelated: Stars Who Got Their Start on Reality TV The road to success in Hollywood is a little different for every would-be actor, but these days, reality TV is becoming a major launching pad for some of the industry's biggest stars. Before they were red-carpet regulars, NeNe Leakes, Jennifer Hudson, Julianne Hough and Lucy Hale were among those who broke through as reality stars\n\nWhile it is unlikely the Good American denim designer will respond to Caitlyn\u2019s diss, she did share her own Mother\u2019s day tribute to Kris on Instagram on Sunday.
