She has really strong family values as well. We were both raised by our moms in single-parent households, and that\u2019s given us a lot of the same family values in life.\u201d\n\nThe duo made their red carpet debut in February 2011 and continued dating on and off until 2018. Shortly after their breakup, Justin moved on with Hailey and they both frequently denied any relationship overlap.\n\n\u201cI can say \u2014 period, point blank \u2014 I was never with him when he was in a relationship with anybody,\u201d she said on the \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d podcast in September 2022. \u201cThat\u2019s the end of it.\u201d\n\nScroll through for a look back at his complete
