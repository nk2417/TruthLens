As she was sitting front row at her father Kanye West\u2019s Adidas New York Fashion Week collection on Thursday, Feb. 12, 20-month-old North West was wearing a bulletproof vest from her dad\u2019s line.\n\nMom Kim Kardashian shared the look on Twitter on Monday, Feb. 16, writing, \u201cLook at my little cutie!!! #BabyYeezyBulletProofVest.\u201d\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Kimye\u2019s sweetest moments Kimye\u2019s happily ever after!

After dropping the baby weight from her pregnancy with North, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star bared her svelte torso in a range of different half-shirts from dazzling high-end pieces [\u2026]\n\nShe then sat front row at the Alexander Wang show on Feb. 14, supporting her aunt Kendall Jenner, who walked in the show. Nori got upset and started crying when she spotted a photographer with a plush monkey toy around his camera lens, but later recovered when he let her play with the toy backstage.\n\nTell Us: What do you think of North\u2019s bulletproof vest?", "images": ["http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg",
