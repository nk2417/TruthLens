Kendrick, George\u2019s Up in the Air co-star, fidgeted with her rings and described herself to a stage manager as \u201cvery nervous but alright\u201d before taking the stage. Exiting and clearly relieved after finishing her remarks, Kendrick bumped into George\u2019s The Monuments Men and The Good German co-star Cate Blanchett, who looked up from a printout of her speech notes and declared, \u201cI\u2019m so bad at this.\u201d (For what it\u2019s worth, no, she\u2019s not, but isn\u2019t it sort of comforting to know that even the seemingly dauntless Blanchett feels anxious before giving a speech?)\n\n\u201cWhy do we do this? We could just say no,\u201d Kendrick said.\n\n\u201cI was just crying in the bathroom,\u201d Blanchett replied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna go have a whiskey, then I\u2019m gonna go laugh so hard and be like, \u2018This fucking bitch. She\u2019s great,\u2019\u201d Kendrick said as a way to assure Blanchett she would have a cheerleader in the crowd during her speech. \u201cNice to meet you, by the way.\u201d\n\nPresenters Courteney Cox and Jennifer Aniston onstage during the American Film Institute\u2019s 46th Life Achievement Award Gala Tribute to George Clooney; Bill Murray and Miley Cyrus enjoy a drink together; Cate Blanchett speaks onstage.

The ladies are swapping!\u201d a stage manager said into his headset, as Aniston and Cox decided to enter from the opposite sides of the stage to which they had been assigned (Aniston preferred to enter from stage left). A photographer asked Aniston if it was O.K. to snap a photo. \u201cDo it without me knowing,\u201d Aniston said.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68ff9a93b697272970dd743c/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691ca5262f7fecc869196baa/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b29abea6163e4725653cbe6/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/t-AFI-Clooney-Celeb.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b29abea6163e4725653cbe6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-AFI-Clooney-Celeb.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b29ac34c5251462a076a00b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Embed-AFI-Clooney.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690cc76e6fd8f93f16471d8d/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b1a8434f47a36695449cb0e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/Amal-Clooney-Introduces-George.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690aa84199b90ea47e65fc9d/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691cd2949f3eb60315ac352e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5afff3d35ffad5416e1cbe22/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/amal-clooney-george.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6910d9c3f337a34950604f6b/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690ba04e625f5a8c4860326f/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68ff979bf104a01e710f8c55/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691b1af3750acb9ee6a2b9d5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690d1b3856c2ba9a94a9f67e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b29abea6163e4725653cbe6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-AFI-Clooney-Celeb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Keegan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/george-clooney-afi", "title": "Exclusive: Here\u2019s What It Was Like Backstage at George Clooney\u2019s A.F.I.
