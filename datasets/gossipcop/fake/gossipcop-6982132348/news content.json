{"url": "www.gq.com/story/chris-pratt-cover-story", "text": "For instance, there is the widely and confidently reported story that he will be the next Indiana Jones. Pratt was on a four-day hunt on a Texas ranch when his manager and agent called to say that this \"fact\" had exploded all over the Internet. \"And so I came home, and then there was paparazzi asking me about it and people asking me to sign Indiana Jones pictures and Indiana Jones hats,\" he says. The truth, as far as he is concerned, is that someone high up at Disney did mention to him a while back that they were picking up the rights to Indiana Jones, to which Pratt commented that his action-adventure card was fairly full. (If Jurassic World does well, there will be sequels. And for the record, this is how he describes, almost more to himself than to me, his future Guardians of the Galaxy obligations: \"...I\u2019m tied to doing three more, or five more, Guardians of the Galaxy or whatever it is, you know, two more Guardians plus another couple...\" I think this means he is committed to at least two sequels, as well as spin-off projects where his character will appear with other Marvel characters.) But as it happens, he\u2019s also been around Steven Spielberg a fair bit recently (Spielberg produced Jurassic World), both before and after this rumor broke. \"I just didn\u2019t bring it up and he didn\u2019t bring it up,\" he says, \"so I don\u2019t know.\"\n\nWhen asked by GQ to comment on this pastime, Offerman issued the following statement: \"Chris and I merely recognized in one another a formidable, concordant creator. Our \u2019pieces\u2019 transcend bourgeois notions like \u2019taste,\u2019 \u2019decorum,\u2019 and \u2019NSFW.\u2019 That\u2019s plebeian stuff. He is magnificent\u2014a lavatorial Michelangelo, and I am his Da Vinci. He proffers Rubber Soul, and I reply with Pet Sounds. The notions of \u2019culture,\u2019 \u2019good taste,\u2019 \u2019decency,\u2019 and \u2019common sense\u2019 are but flotsam to us. Jetsam, even. Our works have honesty in their fiber. His letter N, I met with a lengthy riposte: a twenty-six-inch rejoinder, to be precise, unbroken. From the backstage dressing room of an eldritch Kansas City auditorium. We are Komodo dragons, Christopher and I. We are moray eels, mated for life. Look away\u2014back to your BuzzFeed puppies and falsettos. Ours is an ursine language, of which, if you have to ask\u2014you\u2019ll never know.\"\n\nSimilarly, it\u2019s also been rumored recently that he will appear in a Channing Tatum-produced Ghostbusters remake. Even less likely. \"No one has ever even spoken to me about that,\" he says. \"Never. I\u2019ve even seen Channing a couple times. As far as I know, that\u2019s complete bullshit.\" He ticks off others. \"Knight Rider\u2014bullshit. All of them.\" As we talk, a photo comes through on his phone. His son. \"My son went to the dentist for the first time today,\" he says. \"Oh, my God, he\u2019s smiling. Oh, sweet boy!\" Pratt tells me that he and Faris would like more kids. \"I had siblings, so did Anna\u2014we both dream of it. Jack should have the gift of a little person to push around, whether we have kids or potentially have a surrogate or adopt kids. He was premature, and Anna\u2019s 38, so the idea of going through that again\u2014that was tough, and I think, like, that\u2019s something to truly consider.\"\n\nEither way, he clearly thinks of Jack as a kind of reality check. \"I have a feeling I\u2019ll be tested and I\u2019ll have to prove to him that he\u2019s more important to me than show business,\" says Pratt, \"and I feel I\u2019ll be ready to pass that test. You know, if it means not being Indiana Jones or if it means turning down a big paycheck so that I can go camping for the weekend, being difficult with my contract so that I can be let out, and it means the quality of the film goes down because I\u2019m not there to give everything, then so be it. And if it means retiring early and getting a ranch somewhere and just bird hunting, that\u2019s kind of what I secretly want to do anyways, so\"\u2014he laughs\u2014\"that\u2019ll be sweet.\"\n\nBut how much do you secretly want to do it? Because you can do it if you want to.\n\n\"We\u2019ll see. I don\u2019t know. I think I would do it and then three months later I would be tired of bird hunting and I would be like \u2019...Guardians Ten?\u2019 \"\n\nCHRIS HEATH is a GQ correspondent.", "images": ["https://media.gq.com/photos/564b5985fc144926178b300c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/amy-schumer-obama-gift.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6917a602344e3b09451b19b3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6916aa75ea366cd8560f5749/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/55833e213655c24c6c95f1a4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/copilot-style-201506-1431444034252_chris-pratt-gq-june-2015-01.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/55833e2309f0bee564416d35/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/copilot-style-201506-1431444034253_chris-pratt-gq-june-2015-02.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/564276266ff00fb522b0741b/1:1/w_775%2Cc_limit/obama-tout.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6916928260d328606a06ec5f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/691b99d8ae69092d9a6ffaaf/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/68f69dd0114bd501a60952fc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6918c0d60f55439162cf675b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5582c953e52bc4b477a9d88c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/entertainment-2015-06-chris-pratt-june-cover-409.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/691b5fb90d9c7fdcb52ade2c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/55833e253655c24c6c95f1a8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/copilot-style-201506-1431444034254_chris-pratt-gq-june-2015-03.jpg", "http://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/68c88de476e8da9f4a84b640/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/asset-tentpole-moty.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/561c0bcee8a83977119f8388/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202015-10-12%2520at%25203.33.54%2520PM.png", "http://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6914be2215d385d69a3404ff/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6734dab3891e1dfdb80ca527/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Heath", "Bill Simmons"], "canonical_link": "https://www.gq.com/story/chris-pratt-cover-story", "title": "Chris Pratt Cover Story: From Dadbod Sidekick to Rock-Hard Hero", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Chris Heath", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "The ripped star of Jurassic World reflects on what became of his pudgier, goofier self", "id": "5582c9541177d66d68d589fa", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5582c9541177d66d68d589fa", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The ripped star of Jurassic World reflects on what became of his pudgier, goofier self\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The ripped star of Jurassic World reflects on what became of his pudgier, goofier self", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg", "site_name": "GQ", "title": "Chris Pratt Cover Story: From Dadbod Sidekick to Rock-Hard Hero", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gq.com/story/chris-pratt-cover-story"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2015-05-18T00:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2015-05-18T00:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chris Heath"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@gqmagazine", "description": "The ripped star of Jurassic World reflects on what became of his pudgier, goofier self", "domain": "https://www.gq.com", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@gqmagazine", "title": "Chris Pratt Cover Story: From Dadbod Sidekick to Rock-Hard Hero"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5592cf226abb7583307c4c13/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/0615-GQ-FECP02-01.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 606963029328755, "pages": 7962048097}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1431907200.0, "source": "http://www.gq.com", "summary": ""}
