He then unfollowed the 41-year-old singer on Twitter today, the same day it was announced she had left Interscope Records to start her own record label under BMG and will be working with them on her upcoming solo album, Double Duchess.

It was actually Fergie\u2019s decision to leave, and the guys weren\u2019t too happy about it initially, but they\u2019re cool now and just looking forward to the future.\u201d\n\nAnother insider close to the group told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that the group started to think about breaking up around the Super Bowl in January, when Fergie performed solo during the ESPN party in Houston, Texas. If the group \u2014 which also includes member apl.de.ap \u2014 is officially donezo, we do hope they stay on good terms.
