So in addition to the political pundits on news networks such as CNN and Fox, those in the entertainment industry have taken to Twitter to speak out on the Manafort story. This includes James Gunn, Rob Reiner, Rosie O\u2019Donnel, Alyssa Milano and more.\n\nSpecifically, Manafort and business associate Rick Gates have been indicted on 12 counts, which include: conspiracy against the U.S., conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading statements related to the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act, false statements, and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts. However, none of these charges are directly related to the Trump campaign as of yet. Per the New York Times, the FBI has been investigating Manafort long before he was hired by Trump for suspicion of tax violations and money laundering.\n\nIn this instance, Manafort has been indicted on charges that he \u201cfunneled millions of dollars through overseas shell companies and used the money to buy luxury cars, real estate, antiques and expensive suits.\u201d\n\nMembers of Hollywood wasted no time in adding their voices to the rising chorus against Manafort:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/924999311074758656?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thewrap.com%2Fhollywood-reacts-to-manafort-indictment-the-sinking-of-americas-first-crime-family%2F\n\nThe Manafort indictments make you wonder anew why Roger Stone was freaking out on Twitter the other day.

It rather evokes a Xmas carol: \u201cOn the first day of charges, Mueller gave to me: Manafort on treas\u2019nous conspiracy!\u201d \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) October 30, 2017\n\nHey @realDonaldTrump! Just a reminder! Paul Manafort is your former campaign manager.
