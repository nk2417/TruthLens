After meeting on the set of I Know What You Did Last Summer in 1997, the duo were strictly friends. Three years later, however, sparks flew when Gellar and Prinze accidentally found themselves on a date.\n\n\n\n\"We had made plans for dinner with a mutual friend and the person canceled,\" Gellar told People. \"We decided to have dinner anyway and never looked back.\"\n\nThe couple later tied the knot at the El Careyes resort in Mexico and welcomed two children together: daughter Charlotte and son Rocky. As for the secret to their 23-year marriage? Prinze says there isn't one.\n\n\"There\u2019s no rules,\" he told US Weekly in 2020. \"There\u2019s nothing like that. I don\u2019t believe in false expectations. I just believe in knowing who you are when you start a relationship. And if you don\u2019t, then that relationship probably isn\u2019t going to work.\u201d\n\nAhead, everything you should know about Sarah Michelle Gellar's '90s heartthrob husband, Freddie Prinze Jr.\n\n\n\nThey met on the set of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer.'\n\nGellar and Prinze first met while filming the teen slasher flick I Know What You Did Last Summer in North Carolina in 1997, but they were strictly friends. According to Prinze, Gellar didn't have her driver's license and he would drive her to the gym, which was over an hour away, allowing for plenty of time to get to know each other.\n\n\"I started driving her, and that\u2019s when her and I became friends,\" Prinze told Us Weekly in 2020. \"And we just would talk about life and stuff like that, and we had completely different philosophies on just about everything. \u2018Cause she was a born and raised New Yorker and I was a born and raised L.A. kid, and we just looked at everything like night and day.\u201d\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar Freddie Prinze Jr. in 2000. Getty Images\n\nOnce filming wrapped, Prinze wasn't feeling a love connection, but still, the two kept in touch. \"I just wanted to be friends with her because I thought she was too skinny and I wanted to cook for her. Because that\u2019s what my family does,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd so, we started this weekly barbecue thing at her house, and me and my cousins would come over and cook food for her and her friends. And then we\u2019d make sure everybody ate, and that was kind of how our friendship began.\u201d\n\nTheir first date was an accident.\n\nThree years after they initially introduced, Gellar and Prinze planned to have dinner with a mutual friend, but as fate would have it, their pal couldn't make it and the two still decided to meet. \"We were just two people at dinner catching up,\" Gellar told People of their accidental meet-cute. \"We had a long car ride and a long dinner and things just happened.\"\n\nIn a 2016 Facebook Live interview, Prinze said Gellar won him over with her appetite. \"A lot of girls back then in Hollywood\u2014as far as the actresses\u2014they didn't eat. They ate salad,\" he said. \"I had gone on a date with a handful of them; they would never eat what I would eat.\" He continued, \"Sarah came to dinner with me, and we sat down. She ate everything, including a crab that they let walk across the counter, then killed while it was alive in some oil and said, 'It's popcorn, try.'\"\n\n\n\nHe proposed in 2001.\n\nAfter dating for over a year, Gellar and Prinze got engaged on April 13, 2001, per ABC News. A rep for the couple confirmed the news and revealed that they announced their engagement to their friends and family at Sarah's 24th birthday party the next day.\n\nThey co-starred in 'Scooby-Doo.'\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar Freddie Prinze Jr. at the premiere of 'Scooby-Doo.'. Getty Images\n\nFollowing the success of I Know What You Did Last Summer, Prinze and Gellar starred in their first movie together since their friendship turned romantic. In Scooby-Doo, Gellar played Daphne Blake, while Prinze took on the role of Fred Jones, and at the film's premiere, the couple adorably coordinated outfits on the red carpet. The duo later reprised their roles for the 2004 sequel, Scooby-Doo 2.\n\nThey tied the knot in Mexico.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. at their wedding in 2002.

Film director Adam Shankman, who worked with Sarah on Buffy the Vampire Slayer, officiated the ceremony. Other famous guests included Shannen Doherty and Wilmer Valderrama.\n\nThey share two children.\n\nSarah Michelle Gellar with her son Rocky. Instagram/@sarahmgellar\n\nThe couple welcomed their first child, Charlotte Grace, on September 19, 2009. A rep for Gellar told People at the time that the pair were \"over the moon\" with their baby girl. Three years later, Charlotte became a big sister with the arrival of Gellar and Prinze's second baby, a boy named Rocky James. As fate would have it, Rocky was also born on September 19.\n\n\u201cThey are thrilled that Charlotte [has] a little brother,\u201d a source told People at the time. \u201cThey love their little girl more than anything in the world and know that love will only multiply.\u201d\n\n\n\nGellar and Prinze have since shared that they are \"probably stricter than most\" when it comes to parenting; that said, they value character development over achievements.\n\n\u201cI just always say to my children, 'I don't care if you're the star quarterback and I don't care if you get the best grades, I care that you're a kind and empathetic human and that's what's most important to me,\" Gellar once told People. \"'And the rest will follow.'\"", "images":
