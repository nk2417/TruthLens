Together, the two discussed Perry\u2019s desire to be live an more genuine life \u2014 something she\u2019d been inspired to do after drawing an \u201cauthenticity\u201d card from a desk of inspirational Angel Cards in the wake of her last album, 2013\u2019s Prism.\n\nKaty Perry/Youtube\n\nAttempting to leave behind the heightened pop persona that catapulted the \u201cCalifornia Girls\u201d singer into stardom, Perry told Dr. Singh that she often feels divided between \u201cKaty Perry, pop star\u201d and \u201cKatheryn Hudson,\u201d the \u201cdork\u201d her family and close friends know.\n\nThe dichotomy is part of the reason Perry decided to embark on such a drastic pixie haircut. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to look like Katy Perry anymore,\u201d she said \u2014 adding that the haircut had provoked hate and abuse from users on social media.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a bit more nerdy than everybody thinks I am, I\u2019m a big goofball. The fantasy of Katheryn went into Katy and made this bigger than life personality,\u201d Perry said, Australia\u2019s News Corp reported. \u201cThat\u2019s the point of this whole thing, if people can see I\u2019m just like them then they can dream just as big,\u201d\n\nTears (and mascara) running down her face, Perry also opened up about her past battles with alcohol \u2014 admitting that she had struggled with thoughts of suicide in the past, according to News Corp.\n\n\u201cI wrote a song about it,\u201d she said according to News Corp. \u201cI feel ashamed that I would have those thoughts, feel that low and that depressed.\u201d\n\nShe reportedly added: \u201cYou can be right or you can be loved. I just want to be loved.\u201d\n\nKaty Perry. Britta Pedersen/dpa-Zentralbild/dpa /MediaPunch\n\n\u201cHonestly, I was [surprised] for an artist of that magnitude to be so open and vulnerable,\u201d Dr. Singh tells PEOPLE. \u201cI\u2019m really having that experience with the majority of people that I work with because I think that I create a safe space for them to be themselves where I\u2019m not judging them.\u201d\n\nAfter the session, Perry \u201cactually said \u2018thank you for having such a safe space,'\u201d he adds. \u201cThe whole session was about the dichotomy of the conflict between her professional persona of Katy Perry and her individual human life of Katherine Hudson. At the end, she said that she was going to integrate them.\u201d The special one-hour episode of Katy Perry on The Therapist will air on June 19 at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT on Viceland.\n\nPerry\u2019s fans were captivated, praising the star on Twitter for her honesty.\n\nFROM PEN: Lea Michele Dream-Casts Her Own Real-Life Girl Squad\u2014from Country Darling Maren Morris to Beyonc\u00e9\n\n\u201cThat therapy session With Katy Perry was so captivating and emotion\u2026 really opened my eyes,\u201d wrote one fan.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gained so much respect for Katy Perry,\u201d added another. \u201cHer therapy session and allowing the world to witness her\u2026 my heart breaks seeing her sadness.\u201d\n\nAt the end of Perry\u2019s session, Dr. Singh offered her a wooden bowl filled with a fresh stack of Angel Cards, MTV.com reported. The one she pulled out appeared to give Perry exactly what she was looking for: \u201cFreedom.\u201d\n\nPerry\u2019s 72-hour \u201cWitness World Wide\u201d YouTube special is running through Monday, culminating in a free concert for a select group of fans.\n\nWitness is out now and available to stream and purchase.", "images":
