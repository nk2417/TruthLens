But shortly after Dion left the stage, she couldn't help but burst into song once more\u2014this time she was singing along to her icon Cher's performance of \"Believe.\"\n\nDion was stopped dead in her tracks backstage by hearing Cher\u2014who slayed the BBMA stage by belting out her 1998 dance-pop hit \"Believe\" wearing nothing but heart-shaped pasties, a thong, and a \"robe\" made out of strands of silver jewels (further proving her Icon award was well-deserved). And like all of us, Dion couldn't help but dance and sing along with the 71-year-old, leading the press room in an impromptu karaoke session of the song that rocked radio waves nearly two decades ago.\n\nSeveral people captured the legendary moment on video (bless you, social media). Naturally the clips prove that Dion's vocal range is just as impressive in a random sing-along session as it is in a full-blown Vegas production.
