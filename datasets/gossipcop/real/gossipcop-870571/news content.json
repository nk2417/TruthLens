{"url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/zendaya-cringes-at-old-youtube-videos-of-herself", "text": "Zendaya, queen of one-of-a-kind style and woke interviews, has the whole \"authenticity\" thing down pat. To her, the thought of not being 100 percent true to herself is cringeworthy\u2014hence, why she was literally cringing as she revisited some of her old videos from her short stint as a vlogger.\n\nThe Spider-Man: Homecoming star posted a video in which she watched and critiqued YouTube videos created by her 14-year-old self, Elle reports. The peppy girl in the videos\u2014whose catchphrase is \"don't forget to smile\"\u2014is admittedly quite a bit different from the Zendaya the world is used to seeing slay on red carpets and take down trolls on Twitter.\n\n\"When I was younger, I genuinely felt that I had to make a persona that matched Rocky, which is the character that I used to play,\" she says of the old clips, referencing her character on Disney Channel's Shake It Up. \"This is back when I literally had an entire alter-ego, and this sh*t is so obnoxious \u2014 I can't even believe.\"\n\nAs it turns out, 2017 Zendaya isn't really feeling 2010 Zendaya's schtick. \"'Happy smiley faces?' What the f*ck?\" she asks, genuinely horrified at the things her younger self said. \"I was trying to make this positive environment and trying to be this f*cking ray of sunshine. This is the most annoying sh*t I have ever seen in my entire life. And the thing is, at the time I was like, 'Oh, the kids are going to love it. It'll be cool. Whatever,'\" she said.\n\nShe goes on to mock her own, totally forced body language and word choices, and she even admits that her haters back in the day may have had a point. \"No wonder people were annoyed with me,\" she says. \"Like, 'Oh, she is annoying!' Yes, honey, I was!\"\n\nZendaya continues to call out her 14-year-old self for 4-and-a-half straight minutes, at one point declaring: \"I need to delete these... because it's so fake.\" Hey, she's nothing if not real.\n\nThankfully, the vids are all still online for the world's viewing pleasure.
