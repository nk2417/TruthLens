This is where Mark Hamill reprised his role as Luke Skywalker for the first time since 1983, standing opposite Daisy Ridley, whose character, Rey, was the protagonist of The Force Awakens, J. J. Abrams\u2019s resumption of George Lucas\u2019s Star Wars movie saga. The opening sentence of the film\u2019s scrolling-text \u201ccrawl,\u201d a hallmark of the series, was \u201cLuke Skywalker has vanished.\u201d Atop Skellig Michael, at the picture\u2019s very end, after an arduous journey by Rey, came the big payoff: a cloaked, solitary figure unhooding himself to reveal an older, bearded Luke, who wordlessly, inscrutably regarded the tremulous Rey as she presented to him the lightsaber he had lost (along with his right hand) in a long-ago duel with Darth Vader, his father turned adversary. It was movie magic: a scene that, though filmed in 2014 and presented in theaters in 2015, is already etched in cinematic history.\n\nThe second trip to Skellig Michael? Maybe less of a thrill for an aging Jedi. Contrary to what one might have reasonably expected, that Abrams would have kept rolling in \u201914, recording some dialogue between Luke and Rey in order to get a jump on the saga\u2019s next installment\u2014especially given that Skellig Michael is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with access limited to the summer months, and only when the weather is cooperative\u2014once Hamill and Ridley had nailed their epic staredown, that was a wrap. It fell to Abrams\u2019s successor, Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, the eighth movie in the saga, which opens this December, to painstakingly re-stage the clifftop scene, with the two actors retaking their places more than a year later.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592457899658080c3abf7119/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5924578952a3f44dc6f3a8a5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592334b734765321e4a46484/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/t-SW-Covers-02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592457a5dffe772993b30b3c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss11.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fbde150b3b961d91154947/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59245798dffe772993b30b39/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss06.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e36cac48e51f42566b391/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59245798b2306f2287537fd1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss09.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5924578952a3f44dc6f3a8a7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fa73de018822eab33ea7c5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69121562183bbbb5eb312f87/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69161589683a0692afe31872/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fb86a1172e030be4533183/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5924579852a3f44dc6f3a8a9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss10.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69094fd31360b9a47d7e816c/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592457a5dffe772993b30b3f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss14.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59245798b2306f2287537fcf/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss08.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5924578a34765321e4a464ac/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69178ae76161d5beda0d5421/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5924972da697a436a685292e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-longform-a.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6915f5869e297cb897143240/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592457a53695284c0188d4c5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss13.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592457a5dffe772993b30b3d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss12.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690a5ee0da787343f1849201/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5924578a9658080c3abf711b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss05.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/592457989658080c3abf711d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-ss07.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5924972da697a436a685292e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-star-wars-portfolio-06-2017-longform-a.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David Kamp", "Annie Leibovitz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/star-wars-the-last-jedi-cover-portfolio", "title": "Cover Story: Star Wars: The Last Jedi, the Definitive Preview", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "David Kamp", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Star Wars devotees who can\u2019t wait for December need look no further.
