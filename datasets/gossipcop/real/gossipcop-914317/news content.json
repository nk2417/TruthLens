The actress had tried to move to Manhattan after she fell for Justin, 46, who owns a place in Greenwich Village, but Jen, 49, \u201ccouldn\u2019t deal with the paparazzi and the pokey apartment,\u201d and retreated back to the privacy of her sprawling Bel Air estate.\n\n\u201cJennifer is more comfortable in Los Angeles with her close-knit group of friends,\u201d said a source, adding, \u201cBut Justin doesn\u2019t feel as at home in LA, nor with Jennifer\u2019s friends, he loves New York, and the edgier crowd in the city.\u201d\n\nWhile the couple, who married in 2015 after dating for five years, spent a lot of time apart for work, he began taking more time alone in NYC.\n\nThe source added, \u201cAs they spent more and more time apart, their problems became bigger. He\u2019s very focused on himself and his craft. And Jen is not the easygoing girl she wants the public to think she is. She isn\u2019t as happy, and she is far more complicated.\u201d\n\nPutting further strain on the relationship, Justin\u2019s career is busier than ever with upcoming films, \u201cOn the Basis of Sex,\u201d \u201cMute\u201d and \u201cThe Spy Who Dumped Me.\u201d Jennifer, who still earns millions from product deals and \u201cFriends\u201d reruns, has been taking on fewer big roles \u2014 her next movie is a comedy called \u201cDumplin.\u2019\u201d\n\nThey announced their split Thursday, hours after Page Six contacted their reps about the separation, which we were told was initiated by Justin.\n\nUncomfortably, Jen is on the cover of Architectural Digest\u2019s brand new issue, showing off her and Justin\u2019s supposed Bel Air \u201clove nest.\u201d The article swoons, \u201cJennifer \u2026 crafts a scene of pure domestic bliss with husband Justin Theroux.\u201d\n\nShe coos in the piece, \u201cI look around at my husband and my dogs and our home, and there\u2019s nowhere else I want to be.\u201d\n\nTellingly, there\u2019s no sign of Justin at the home. And on Thursday, as Architectural Digest editor Amy Astley hosted an NYC cocktail party to celebrate the issue, \u201cEveryone\u2019s phones started pinging with a news alert that Jen and Justin had split. It was all rather embarrassing. The magazine editors had no idea.\u201d", "images": ["https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/jen-justin.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/kevin-spacey-homeless.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115847739.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2FFF-WP.png?w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115879604.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/jen-justin.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115845623.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115838388.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115875312.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115742458.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/kevin-spacey-homeless.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115820363.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115838388.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115879604.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/paige2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115852692.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115883447.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2013/08/emily-smith-01.png?w=76&h=69&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/gettyimages-691648022.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=171&h=114&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115669041.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115883447.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Felemis-black-friday.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1763642967&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115883447.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115886570.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115863099.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/jen-justin.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/02/16/the-real-reason-jennifer-aniston-and-justin-theroux-split/", "title": "Exclusive | The real reason Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux split", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
