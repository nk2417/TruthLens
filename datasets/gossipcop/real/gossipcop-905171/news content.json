You\u2019re not under oath. You don\u2019t have to leave bread crumbs all over social media if you don\u2019t want to,\u201d Perry continued. \u201cBut some people do that and need that and it\u2019s a tool. Listen, all the fame stuff is just a bi-product of what I do, it\u2019s not what I sought out to do. I just wanted to tell stories and sing and connect with people.\u201d\n\nHer comment about her personal life comes days after she and ex Orlando Bloom fueled reconciliation rumors after they were snapped by fans enjoying a meal together in the Maldives.\n\nFrederick M. Brown/Getty\n\nHowever, the pair is not officially back together and are very much still friends, a source close to Bloom, 40, told PEOPLE recently.\n\n\u201cOrlando and Katy were traveling separately over the holidays and met up in the Maldives after,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey have fun and love seeing each other, but it\u2019s nothing serious. They are not officially back together.\u201d\n\nDave M. Benett/VF17/WireImage\n\nWhile Perry admitted that she does not abstain from social media, it\u2019s not her main priority.\n\n\u201cI love movies. I love traveling. I love culture. I love modern art museums. But I\u2019m just like anyone, I scroll,\u201d she said on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Grammy-nominated star remains focused on her career and making music that will inspire her fans.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve got to keep it spicy for sure. Especially with young people their attention spans and people in general,\u201d Perry shared. \u201cOur options and our choices \u2013 we have so much choice we don\u2019t even know what to choose these days. I think you really have to separate yourself and that sometime you hit bells and whistles. Or maybe you\u2019re such an authentic person you can hear it in their voice. I don\u2019t want to hear people\u2019s voices. I want to feel people\u2019s voices.\u201d\n\nThe singer is advising those hoping to be the next American Idol, that choosing one of her songs is not going to win them any extra points.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be tough but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019d be the smartest thing to do unless you\u2019re reinventing it. Because typically I would be singing it the night before and I\u2019ve sang it ten thousand times,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut I want to hear it. But if you reinvent it then you re-inspire it for me so you give me that dopamine hit of \u2018oh yeah I feel that, I want to see what you do with something else.'\u201d\n\nPerry admits hearing what some of the singers have gone through to get a chance to sing for her is a \u201cbeautiful hurt\u201d \u2013 but she is trying to keep her emotions at bay when it comes to being a judge.\n\n\u201cYou really get invested in their stories obviously after you realize they have that kind of diamond in the rough,\u201d the \u201cSwish Swish\u201d singer said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard when they\u2019re trying to sell the whole thing on the sob story it\u2019s like, everybody is going through something. Everybody comes from somewhere. I\u2019m not dismissing that and I don\u2019t want to take light of your situation but this is a business and we\u2019re here to find someone to elevate, to make an Idol.\u201d\n\nAmerican Idol premieres on ABC Sunday, March 11.", "images":
