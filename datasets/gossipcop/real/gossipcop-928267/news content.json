Abrams is bringing someone brand new into the fold: filmmaker Victoria Mahoney. The filmmaker and producer (and, fun fact, bit actor in \u201cLegally Blonde\u201d) will serve as the second unit director on Abrams\u2019 upcoming untitled \u201cEpisode IX,\u201d marking the first time an African-American woman has served in any directing capacity on a \u201cStar Wars\u201d film.\n\nThe news was first announced by fellow Disney filmmaker, Ava DuVernay, who shared a picture of Mahoney and Abrams hanging out at a recent open house at her own production and distribution company, ARRAY.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/ava/status/986378268742828032?tfw_creator=krolljvar&tfw_site=variety&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2018%2Ffilm%2Fnews%2Fj-j-abrams-victoria-mahoney-second-unit-director-for-star-wars-ix-1202756681%2F\n\nAbrams is currently in pre-production on the film, and Mahoney will step into a role that requires a close attention to detail, mostly dedicated to shooting essential pieces like establishing shots, stunts, inserts, and cutaways. Mahoney is herself already an established filmmaker who has spent the past few years working inside the television space, including stints on DuVernay\u2019s \u201cQueen Sugar,\u201d plus \u201cGypsy,\u201d \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d and more. She just completed directing a pilot for CBS entitled \u201cRed Line,\u201d which was executive produced by DuVernay and fellow heavy-hitter Greg Berlanti. Also on deck: Mahoney is penning a TV adaptation of the novel \u201cDawn\u201d for DuVernay and Charles King\u2019s MACRO.\n\nBut she\u2019s no stranger to filmmaking, and Mahoney\u2019s debut feature \u2014 \u201cYelling at the Sky,\u201d which was loosely based on her own life \u2014 premiered at the Berlin Film Festival in 2011.\n\nWhile Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kenned has repeatedly said that \u201cStar Wars\u201d is eager to tap more diverse talent, the hiring of Mahoney is the first major sign of progress in years. Last year, Kennedy drew ire after a Variety interview during which she told the trade that although finding a female director for one of their features was a priority, the studio \u201cwant[s] to make sure that when we bring a female director in to do \u2018Star Wars,\u2019 they\u2019re set up for success\u2026They\u2019re gigantic films, and you can\u2019t come into them with essentially no experience.\u201d\n\nShe also added that, because of the perceived lack of female filmmakers with blockbuster experience believed to be essential to making a \u201cStar Wars\u201d film, they were actively looking for appropriate talent. Kennedy said at the time, \u201cWe want to really start to focus in on people we would love to work with and see what kinds of things they\u2019re doing to progress up that ladder now, and then pull them in when the time is right.\u201d\n\n\u201cStar Wars: Episode IX\u201d is currently slated to open on December 20, 2019.\n\nSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!
