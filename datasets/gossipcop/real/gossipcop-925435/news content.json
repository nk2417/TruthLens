There's a lot of pressure. And we'll put that on ourselves too; we'll be very demanding about how good this one has to be.\"\n\nKristen Bell meanwhile, the voice of Anna, has said that the script for Frozen 2 \"exudes quality\".\n\nFrozen is currently the ninth highest-grossing film of all time, having peaked at number five.\n\nDisney's full release schedule:\n\n2017 films\n\n5/5/17 GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2 (3D)\n\n5/26/17 PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES (3D)\n\n6/16/17 CARS 3 (3D)\n\n11/3/17 THOR: RAGNAROK (3D)\n\nWed 11/22/17 COCO (3D)\n\n12/15/17 STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI (3D)\n\n2018 films\n\n2/16/18 BLACK PANTHER (3D)\n\n3/9/18 A WRINKLE IN TIME (3D)\n\n4/6/18 MAGIC CAMP\n\n5/4/18 AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR (3D)\n\n5/25/18 UNTITLED HAN SOLO STAR WARS ANTHOLOGY FILM (3D)\n\n6/15/18 THE INCREDIBLES 2 (3D)\n\n7/6/18 ANT-MAN AND THE WASP (3D)\n\n8/3/18 UNTITLED DISNEY FAIRY TALE (Live Action)\n\n11/2/18 MULAN (Live Action) (3D)\n\nWed 11/21/18 RALPH BREAKS THE INTERNET: WRECK-IT RALPH 2 (3D)\n\nTues 12/25/18 MARY POPPINS RETURNS\n\n2019 films\n\n3/8/19 CAPTAIN MARVEL (3D)\n\n3/29/19 UNTITLED DISNEY FAIRY TALE (Live Action)\n\n4/12/19 UNTITLED DISNEYTOON STUDIOS\n\n5/3/19 UNTITLED AVENGERS (3D)\n\n5/24/19 STAR WARS: EPISODE IX (3D)\n\n6/21/19 TOY STORY 4 (3D)\n\n7/19/19 THE LION KING (Live Action) (3D)\n\n8/9/19 UNTITLED DISNEY LIVE ACTION\n\n11/8/19 UNTITLED DISNEY FAIRY TALE (Live Action)\n\nWed 11/27/19 FROZEN 2 (3D)\n\n12/20/19 UNTITLED DISNEY FAIRY TALE (Live Action)\n\n2020 films\n\n3/13/20 UNTITLED PIXAR ANIMATION (3D)\n\n4/3/20 UNTITLED DISNEY LIVE ACTION\n\n5/1/20 UNTITLED MARVEL (3D)\n\n6/19/20 UNTITLED PIXAR ANIMATION (3D)\n\n7/10/20 UNTITLED INDIANA JONES\n\n8/7/20 UNTITLED MARVEL (3D)\n\n11/6/20 UNTITLED MARVEL (3D)\n\nWed 11/25/20 GIGANTIC (3D)\n\n2021 films\n\n3/12/21 UNTITLED DISNEY LIVE ACTION\n\n6/18/21 UNTITLED PIXAR ANIMATION (3D)\n\nWed 11/24/21 UNTITLED DISNEY ANIMATION (3D)", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/26/08/frozen2.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/26/08/frozen2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/26/08/frozen2.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/frozen-2-release-date-sequel-return-cinemas-film-movie-launch-a7702461.html", "title": "Frozen 2 release date: Disney sets a day for highly-anticipated sequel", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/films/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "Kristen Bell will reprise the role of Princess Anna", "og": {"updated_time": "2017-04-26T07:56:07.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Frozen 2 finally has a release date", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/news/frozen-2-release-date-sequel-return-cinemas-film-movie-launch-a7702461.html", "type": "article", "description": "Kristen Bell will reprise the role of Princess Anna", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/26/08/frozen2.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/26/08/frozen2.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-04-26T07:56:07.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-04-26T07:56:07.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Film", "author_name": "Christopher Hooton", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 570, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 2, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 0}, "date": "2017-04-26T07:56:07.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Frozen 2 finally has a release date", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kristen Bell will reprise the role of Princess Anna", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/26/08/frozen2.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Frozen 2\",\"Frozen\",\"Disney+\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493193367.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
