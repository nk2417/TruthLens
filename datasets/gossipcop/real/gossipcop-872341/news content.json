William was 15 and Harry was 12 at the time.\n\nI think it was a very hard decision for my grandmother to make. She felt very torn between being a grandmother to William and Harry and her Queen role. \u2014 Prince William on Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s reaction to Princess Diana\u2019s death\n\nThe public outpouring of grief surrounding Diana\u2019s death thrust the British monarchy into a harsh public debate over its aloof treatment of the former member of the royal family. The palace\u2019s attempt to conceal its reactions and handling of the news made the public increasingly hostile toward the institution. The princes touch on those topics in the documentary.\n\n\u201cI think it was a very hard decision for my grandmother to make. She felt very torn between being a grandmother to William and Harry and her Queen role,\u201d William said (via the Guardian) of the queen\u2019s decision to sequester the family at their Balmoral estate in Scotland immediately after Diana\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cAt the time, you know, my grandmother wanted to protect her two grandsons, and my father as well. Our grandmother deliberately removed the newspapers, and things like that, so there was nothing in the house at all. So we didn\u2019t know what was going on,\u201d he added.\n\nWilliam, second in line to the British throne, and Harry also spoke of how Diana\u2019s death affected their father, Prince Charles, whose crumbling marriage, affair and public divorce made him and Diana regular tabloid fodder. Harry seemed to confirm that it was Charles who broke the news of their mother\u2019s death to them.\n\n\u201cOne of the hardest things for a parent to have to do is tell your children that your other parent has died. How you deal with that, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Harry said (via the Daily Mail). \u201cBut he was there for us. He was the one out of two left. And he tried to do his best and to make sure that we were protected and looked after. But he was going through the same grieving process as well.\u201d\n\nThe paparazzi was a sore subject for Harry too, who said it\u2019s been difficult to come to terms with the fact that the photographers who chased his mother\u2019s car into the Paris tunnel where she died were the same people who witnessed her death.\n\n\u201cShe had quite a severe head injury but was still very much alive on the backseat, and those people that caused the accident instead of helping were taking photographs of her dying. And then those photographs made their way back to news desks in this country,\u201d Harry said.\n\nSeparately, William likened the paparazzi hounding his mother daily to a \u201cpack of dogs.\u201d However, he said he wouldn\u2019t let the traumatic event let his mother\u2019s legacy \u201cgo to waste.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let it break me, I wanted it to make me,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted her to be proud of the person I would become.\u201d\n\n\u201cDiana, 7 Days\u201d airs on the BBC Sunday and on NBC on Sept. 1. It features additional commentary from some of the major players of the time, including the princes, other members of Diana\u2019s family and her friends, royal aides and politicians, namely former prime minister Tony Blair, who urged the palace to appease the public outcry by urging the queen to make a statement.\n\nALSO:\n\nFrom royal to reality: How Princess Diana changed female celebrity and paved the way for Kim Kardashian\n\nThe fashion legacy of Princess Diana is the subject of an exhibit in London\n\nFX renews \u2018Feud\u2019 for a second season that will spotlight Prince Charles and
