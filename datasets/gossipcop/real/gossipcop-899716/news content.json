How could a nom happen & how much more critical acclaim must a movie have to simply get a screening?\" she tweeted.\n\nHowever, a source with knowledge of the situation not authorized to comment publicly confirmed to USA TODAY that there was an official screening on July 18 for the HFPA, and members were also invited to the premiere.\n\nHaddish's awards season chances looked golden after the breakout star earned a supporting actress win from the New York Film Critics Circle and Critics' Choice Awards nominations for Girls Trip. Yet, those precursor honors didn't translate into any Globes nods.\n\nNeed a news break?
