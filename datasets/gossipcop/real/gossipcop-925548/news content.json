Speaking to Variety, Lonergan said the actor has been \u201ctreated abominably\u201d in the #MeToo era. Affleck was the star of Lonergan\u2019s acclaimed 2016 drama \u201cManchester by the Sea.\u201d Lonergan won the best original screenplay prize, while Affleck earned the best actor trophy.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more all for the #MeToo movement,\u201d Lonergan said, \u201cand I couldn\u2019t feel more strongly that he\u2019s been treated abominably. It\u2019s not good for anybody.\u201d\n\nAffleck was accused of sexual harassment by two women who worked with him on his 2010 mock-documentary \u201cI\u2019m Still Here.\u201d The actor settled both suits out of court for an undisclosed amount the same year.\n\nThe allegations resurfaced in the wake of the #MeToo anti-harassment movement and they made headlines again in January when Affleck decided to step down from presenting at this year\u2019s Oscars. Per tradition, Affleck would\u2019ve presented the 2018 best actress trophy, but he bowed out as the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up campaigns took center stage during awards season.\n\nAffleck notified the Academy on January 25 that he would not be attending this year\u2019s ceremony because he did not want his involvement in the telecast to distract from the performances of the five nominated actresses. Affleck realized he was in a \u201cno-win situation\u201d and voluntarily stepped down from his expected role in the broadcast.\n\nMonths earlier in October 2017, just weeks after the Harvey Weinstein allegations reignited the industry\u2019s attention towards sexual abuse and harassment, an online petition circulated asking the Academy to ban Affleck from the telecast. The petition earned over 19,000 signatures.\n\nLonergan\u2019s \u201cHoward\u2019s End\u201d remake premieres April 8 on Starz, and his play \u201cLobby Hero\u201d is currently on Broadway with star Chris Evans. Affleck has kept a relatively low profile as of late, though he starred in David Lowery\u2019s \u201cA Ghost Story\u201d last summer. Affleck\u2019s upcoming credits include Lowery\u2019s \u201cThe Old Man and the Gun\u201d and \u201cLight of My Life,\u201d which he also wrote and directed.\n\nIndieWire has reached out to Lonergan\u2019s representatives for further comment.", "images": ["https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/caitlin-clark-wnbpa-panini.png?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/GettyImages-2184846691.jpg?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2154342172.jpg?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7155.jpg?w=3000&h=2656&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TNB_05859_R-H-2024-1.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-04-05-at-1-59-32-pm.png?w=650", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7417.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/anaconda.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/best-celeb-memoirs-biographies.png?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/john-and-yoko.jpg?w=770&h=980&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thoughts-and-prayers-hbo.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Robin-Williams-Dwayne-Johnson-Jumanji-2-shot.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Zack-Sharf.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-04-05-at-1-59-32-pm.png?w=1278&h=844&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple_TV_Your_Friends_and_Neighbors_key_art_graphic_header_16_9_show_home.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2246549744.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ziggy-marley-jamaica.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-01-at-8.32.46\u202fPM.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7173.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-Lowdown-Ethan-Hawke-interview.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-04-05-at-1-59-32-pm.png?w=650", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zack Sharf"], "canonical_link": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/kenneth-lonergan-defends-casey-affleck-treated-abominably-metoo-harassment-1201949494/", "title": "Kenneth Lonergan Believes Casey Affleck \u2018Has Been Treated Abominably\u2019 in the #MeToo Era", "meta_data": {"description": "Affleck won the Best Actor Oscar for his role in Lonergan's \"Manchester by the Sea.\"", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400654071", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Zack Sharf", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kenneth Lonergan Believes Casey Affleck \u2018Has Been Treated Abominably\u2019 in the #MeToo Era", "url": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/kenneth-lonergan-defends-casey-affleck-treated-abominably-metoo-harassment-1201949494/", "description": "Affleck won the Best Actor Oscar for his role in Lonergan's \"Manchester by the Sea.\"", "site_name": "IndieWire", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-04-05-at-1-59-32-pm.png?w=650", "width": 650, "height": 429, "alt": "Kenneth Lonergan and Casey Affleck"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-05T18:16:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-05T18:20:07+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Affleck won the Best Actor Oscar for his role in Lonergan's \"Manchester by the Sea.\"", "site": "@IndieWire", "creator": "@zsharf", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kenneth Lonergan Believes Casey Affleck \u2018Has Been Treated Abominably\u2019 in the #MeToo Era", "image": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-04-05-at-1-59-32-pm.png?w=650"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-iw_favicon.png?w=270", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522952191.0, "source": "https://www.indiewire.com", "summary": ""}
