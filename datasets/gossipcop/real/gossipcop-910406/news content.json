She\u2019s the most intelligent person in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and leads Wakanda, the most advanced society in the universe. She also happens to be a 16-year-old unapologetically black princess who isn\u2019t afraid to tell a white man, \u201cDon\u2019t scare me like that colonizer.\u201d\n\nShuri is the shit.\n\nLetitia Wright, who plays everyone\u2019s new favorite Disney princess in her breakout \u201cBlack Panther\u201d role, told HuffPost how much it meant to both her and the film\u2019s audiences for director Ryan Coogler and writer Joe Robert Cole to write Shuri as a multidimensional character.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201c[Shuri] shows that when you have people coming together to just take time to make characters well-rounded, well-thought-out, not one way, amazing things like that happen,\u201d the Guyanese actress told HuffPost. \u201cHaving a character arc and journey is refreshing, so it\u2019s good writing ... Now there\u2019s a breakthrough of [audiences] seeing people [they] relate to and that\u2019s refreshing.\u201d\n\nLetitia Wright as Shuri in \"Black Panther.\" Marvel Studios\n\nShuri lit up the screen with her carefree demeanor and unfiltered words each time she graced a scene. Her youthfulness was refreshing, yet her wisdom and courage shine through in the film as she guides Martin Freeman\u2019s Everett Ross through an aerial battle while physically taking on another fight of her own.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWright said even she was surprised at the boldness of blackness and the motherland shown on-screen. But from comic book pages to the MCU, the marriage of positive images of Africans with technology in \u201cBlack Panther\u201d is important for fans to see, she said.\n\n\u201cEven reflecting on it now, I can see little glimpses of when they go down to the Great Mound and go down to Shuri\u2019s lab how beautiful that is. Just seeing that there\u2019s young kids in Shuri\u2019s lab, teenagers and people coming together to create technology. That\u2019s beautiful,\u201d she said. \u201cAll together, it means a lot to see the continent in that way and see the motherland in that way \u2019cause it\u2019s such a beautiful place.\u201d\n\nThe actress also said she hopes young girls will unlock their potential when watching Shuri, especially when it comes to STEM, where women of color made up less than 10 percent of working scientists and engineers in the U.S. in 2015.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI hope it inspires them and I hope it does [so] positively. I hope it sparks the next person,\u201d Wright told HuffPost.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the last fans will see of Shuri. The princess of Wakanda will also have \u201ca cool little part\u201d in \u201cAvengers: Infinity War,\u201d premiering in May. And, fingers crossed, maybe fans will get to see Shuri as the Black Panther one day.\n\nAdvertisement", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c81b22000008806eaf722.jpeg?cache=lbOmtIpmXY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.connatix.com/276d1cb2-8322-41e2-8cc1-293a6d441d8c/1_th.jpg?crop=629:354,smart&width=629&height=354&format=jpeg&quality=60&fit=crop", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/679164f516000015003d3a91.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c81b22000008806eaf722.jpeg?cache=lbOmtIpmXY&ops=1200_630", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/691c87541700009d2b9c5f37.jpg?ops=50_50"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c81b22000008806eaf722.jpeg?cache=lbOmtIpmXY&ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Black Voices Editor Senior Culture Reporter", "Whitney Snyder", "Editor-In-Chief Huffpost"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/black-panther-actress-letitia-wright-hopes-shuri-inspires-more-girls-in-stem_n_5a8ba183e4b09fc01e02b764", "title": "'Black Panther' Actress Letitia Wright Hopes Shuri Inspires More Girls To Pursue STEM", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "All hail Princess Shuri! \u2728", "keywords": "black panther,marvel cinematic universe,Black Panther comics,Letitia Wright,Black Voices,Education,Entertainment,Parenting,Women", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "og": {"title": "'Black Panther' Actress Letitia Wright Hopes Shuri Inspires More Girls To Pursue STEM", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c81b22000008806eaf722.jpeg?cache=lbOmtIpmXY&ops=1200_630", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c81b22000008806eaf722.jpeg?cache=lbOmtIpmXY&ops=1200_630", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/black-panther-actress-letitia-wright-hopes-shuri-inspires-more-girls-in-stem_n_5a8ba183e4b09fc01e02b764", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "All hail Princess Shuri! \u2728"}, "article": {"tag": "black panther,marvel cinematic universe,Black Panther comics,Letitia Wright,Black Voices,Education,Entertainment,Parenting,Women", "section": "Black Voices", "published_time": "2018-02-20T21:51:12Z", "modified_time": "2018-02-21T15:29:33Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@blackvoices", "title": "'Black Panther' Actress Letitia Wright Hopes Shuri Inspires More Girls To Pursue STEM", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a8c81b22000008806eaf722.jpeg?cache=lbOmtIpmXY&ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "description": "All hail Princess Shuri! \u2728"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5a8ba183e4b09fc01e02b764", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "bingbot": "noarchive", "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519163472.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
