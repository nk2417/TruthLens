Promise.\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s love story is truly what fairy tales are made of (you know, minus all that drama with the royal family). From meeting while Meghan was working as an actor to getting married, having two cute babies, and leaving the British royal family to be sorta normal, they\u2019ve been through it all. And even after facing tons of unfair scrutiny from the public and press, they only seem stronger\u2014I mean, they even came out with a six-part Netflix docuseries that explores the entire span of their \u2019ship.\n\nSo while you\u2019re trying to figure out if you have a shot at running into them in Los Angeles, let\u2019s take a trip down memory lane and see how these two royals fell in love.\n\nOctober 31, 2016\n\nThe Sunday Express reports that Prince Harry has been secretly dating Suits star Meghan Markle.

It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is \u2018the price she has to pay\u2019 and that \u2018this is all part of the game.\u2019 He strongly disagrees.

She also confirms that they met in July 2016 and managed to date under the radar for a few months before the press caught on.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that at the end of the day, I think it\u2019s really simple. We\u2019re two people who are really happy and in love. We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people\u2019s perception. Nothing about me changed. I\u2019m still the same person that I am, and I\u2019ve never defined myself by my relationship.\u201d\n\nIn the same interview, Meghan also says \u201cthere will be a time\u201d when they come forward and share more of their life together with the public, but for now, they want to keep things as private as possible. \u201cThis is for us. It\u2019s part of what makes it so special, that it\u2019s just ours. But we\u2019re happy.

Afterwards, apparently the Duchess of Sussex was the first to message him on Instagram.\n\n\"Eventually, we exchanged phone numbers, and mitigated the conversation over to text, going late into the night,\" Harry dishes in the project, adding that he was \"texting like a teenager\" through the next day.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex also highlights that it was \"uncanny,\" \"surreal,\" and \"bizarre\" that this convo with his now wife began on July 1, 2016\u2014aka what would have been his mother's fifty-fifth birthday. \ud83e\udd7a\u2764\ufe0f\n\nFor a bunch of other revelatory insights from Spare, check out this handy-dandy story:\n\nRelated Story The Biggest Revelations From Prince Harry\u2019s Memoir\n\nMarch 1, 2023\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Harry and Meghan are asked to leave their Frogmore Cottage home in England. The couple's rep confirms the news to Page Six, saying, \"We can confirm the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have been requested to vacate their residence at Frogmore Cottage.\"\n\nAnd according to The Sun, Harry and Meghan were actually given notice of the eviction just 24 hours after the publication of Harry\u2019s memoir, Spare, in a move that is said to have left the duo \"stunned.\" Plus, on top of the already bombshell news, King Charles has allegedly offered the home to his disgraced brother Prince Andrew, which has us feeling all?!?!?!?!\n\nMarch 3, 2023\n\nIn much lighter news, the royal couple's bb girl Lilibet is christened by the Archbishop of Los Angeles, the Rev John Taylor, during an intimate ceremony at the couple's Montecito home.\n\nApparently, about 20-30 guests attend at the event, including Doria Ragland, Tyler Perry (who is Lilibet's godfather), and a godmother whose name has yet to be revealed. Oh, and apparently Tyler Perry pulls out all the stops for the royal baby's big day, flying in 10-person Gospel choir to sing \"Oh Happy Day\" and \"This Little Light of Mine\" at the event.\n\nOh, and before you ask\u2014yes, King Charles, Queen Camilla, Prince William and Kate Middleton were all invited. But, no, they were not in attendance. Whomp!\n\nMay 16, 2023\n\nHarry and Meghan face a \"near catastrophic car chase\" involving paparazzi in New York City, according to the Sussexes' spokesperson. The couple\u2014as well as the duchess\u2019s mother, Doria Ragland\u2014had just attended the Women of Vision Awards held at the Ziegfeld Ballroom, where Meghan was recognized as one of the ceremony\u2019s honorees.\n\n\"Last night, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Ms. Ragland were involved in a near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi,\" the couple\u2019s spokesperson relays in the statement. \"This relentless pursuit, lasting over two hours, resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road, pedestrians, and two NYPD officers,\" they add.\n\nLuckily, things end up alright; But the incident only fuels the duke's anger toward the press and paparazzi\u2014the latter of which pursued his mother, the late Princess Diana, in Paris in 1997 and caused her limousine to crash as she and her driver attempted to speed away.\n\nSeptember 2, 2023\n\nHarry and Meghan are all smiles during their time attending Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Renaissance Tour concert at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, where they're joined by some friends and even Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland.\n\nSeptember 14, 2023\n\nThe Duke of Sussex celebrates his 39th birthday during his trip to Germany for the sixth edition of his Invictus Games alongside Meghan, and to mark the special occasion, competitors and spectators at the volleyball game between Poland and Germany serenade Harry with a \ud83e\udd7a rendition of \"Happy Birthday.\"\n\nChris Jackson // Getty Images\n\n^A very happy Haz enjoying the singing.\n\nPlus, on the morning of the royal's actual birthday, the Invictus Games organizers show Harry tons of love on their Twitter X account:\n\n\n\nJanuary 23, 2024\n\nHarry and Meghan make a surprise appearance in Jamaica for the Bob Marley: One Love movie premiere.

While there, Harry takes a turn sit-skiing, and Meghan makes sure to capture the moment on camera.\n\nAccording to a video posted on X, the Duchess of Sussex borrows a phone to take a pic of her husband and the whole thing is just \ud83e\udd7a:\n\nMarch 7, 2024\n\nMeghan and Harry have a special date night at Soho House Austin in Texas before the Duchess of Sussex's panel appearance at the SXSW Conference the following day.\n\n\"They were happy and in great spirits,\" an onlooker dishes to People. \"Harry was very animated throughout the dinner. They were super low key and seemed happy to be around the upbeat vibes at the lively venue.\"\n\n\n\nA refresher that Soho House is a very special place for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, since the two had their first date at the SoHo House in London back in July 2016. Let's hear more about the duo's outing back then from Prince Harry himself via his memoir Spare, shall we? Ahem:\n\n\"Red-cheeked, puffing, sweaty, half an hour late, I ran into the restaurant, into the quiet room, and found her sitting at a small area on a low velvet sofa in front of a low coffee table. She was wearing a black sweater, jeans, heels. I knew nothing about clothes, but I knew she was chic. Then again, she could make anything look chic. I'd seen so many photos of her from fashion shoots and TV sets, all glam and glossy, but here she was, in the flesh, no frills, no filter\u2026and even more beautiful. Heart-attack beautiful. I was trying to process this, struggling to understand what was happening to my circulatory and nervous systems, and as a result my brain couldn't handle any more data. Conversation, pleasantries, the Queen's English, all became a challenge.\"\n\nApril 12, 2024\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle share a rare public kiss during Harry's polo match!\n\nYaroslav Sabitov - PA Images // Getty Images\n\nBrb, literally sobbing!!!\n\nMay 10, 2024\n\nThe couple embarks on a three-day visit to Nigeria to meet with military officials and locals, including women leaders and servicepeople. P.S. It's both of their first time in the country and the pics are simply too cute for words:\n\nAndrew Esiebo // Getty Images\n\nAnadolu // Getty Images\n\nAndrew Esiebo // Getty Images\n\nDuring a visit to the Lightway Academy in Abuja, the couple is able to speak to the school's children about mental health. Harry begins by saying, per The Independent, \"In some cases around the world, in more than you would believe, there is a stigma when it comes to mental health. Too many people don\u2019t want to talk about it because it\u2019s invisible. It\u2019s something in our mind that we can\u2019t see. It\u2019s not like a broken leg, it\u2019s not like a broken wrist.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s something that we are still relatively unsure of. But guess what? Every single person in this room, the youngest, the oldest, every single person has mental health. So therefore, you have to look after yourself to be able to look after other people. And other people have to be able to look after themselves, to look after you. That\u2019s the way it works. And there is no shame to be able to acknowledge that today is a bad day, okay?\" he adds.\n\nFollowing the Duke of Sussex's speech, Meghan gushes to the crowd, \"You see why I\u2019m married to him?\" before starting her own speech. \"It\u2019s so inspiring because he speaks the truth.\"\n\nMay 14, 2024\n\nDuring a convo with People while on her and Harry's trip, Meghan notes, \"We\u2019re just doing great. And happy to be watching our family grow up and evolve. Of course, I\u2019m happy. We\u2019re really happy.\" Prince Harry, for his part, muses, \"There\u2019s only so much one can do from home and over Zoom, so we look forward to traveling more because the work matters...Whether it\u2019s the Archewell Foundation, Invictus, or any of our other causes, there will always be reasons to meet the people at the heart of our work.\"\n\nMay 18, 2024\n\nMeghan and Harry celebrate their six-year anniversary with a double date at Lucky's, a steakhouse in the town of Montecito where the couple lives. As for the other duo that joined in on the festivities? That would be Tracy and Brian Robbins, aka a fashion designer and the CEO of Paramount Pictures and Nickelodeon, respectively.\n\nAnd that brings us up to date! Stay tuned for more developments in Harry and Meghan\u2019s love story.\n\n\n\nMay 28, 2024\n\nThe 2016 statement Harry made confirming for the first time that he was dating Meghan is no longer available on the British royal family's website. \ud83d\udc40\n\nIn November 2016, Harry's communications secretary released a rare statement that condemned the \"wave of abuse and harassment\" experienced by his then-girlfriend at the time in the weeks after they first began officially dating.\n\nAccording to Newsweek, the archive site Wayback Machine was able to access the statement on December 3, 2023, but not a week later on December 10, meaning it was likely removed during that time. Truly yiiiikes.\n\nJune 17, 2024\n\nWendell Pierce, the actor who plays Meghan's dad on Suits, gives his two cents on the couple while speaking to People at the 2024 Tony Awards. \"When [Meghan] came into town, she got an award last year, had a chance to say hello and wish she and Prince Harry well and wish the children well,\" he dishes before adding, \"They look very much in love and were very happy, so that's the most important thing.\"\n\nJuly 25, 2024\n\nHarry opens up about the safety concerns he still has for his family during an interview for ITV's Tabloids on Trial.\n\n\"It's still dangerous, and all it takes is one lone actor, one person who reads this stuff to act on what they have read,\" the Duke of Sussex muses before adding, \"And whether it's a knife or acid, whatever it is, and these are things that are of genuine concern for me. It's one of the reasons why I won\u2019t bring my wife back to this country.\"\n\nFWIW, his feelings about the sitch haven't *really* changed over the years, since Harry previously said he \"felt forced\" to step back from his royal role due to security concerns.\n\nJuly 31, 2024\n\nAccording to a former employee of the couple's Archewell Foundation who speaks to People, Meghan wishes that Prince Harry didn't have to continue litigating in his fight for greater security protection for their family.\n\nAccording to the source, she \"supports Harry 100 percent, but she wishes he could let go of these lawsuits, be happy and live in the moment.\" \"She wants him to be free of all of this, but she also knows that because of everything he\u2019s been through and his love for [her and their children], he can\u2019t. She wants him to live in a world where he is not burdened by this,\" the insider continues.\n\n\n\nAugust 1, 2024\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex are heading to Colombia! On August 1, it is announced that the two are set to fly to Bogot\u00e1, Cartagena, and Cali for their next official international trip. The news is shared by Colombia's Vice President Francia M\u00e1rquez in a statement (via People) that reads, in part, \"As the Vice President of Colombia and Minister of Equality and Equity, I am pleased to announce that Prince Harry and Meghan, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have kindly accepted my invitation to visit our beautiful country.\"\n\nAugust 4, 2024\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex give a rare joint interview with CBS Sunday Morning\u2019s Jane Pauley to discuss the launch of the Parents' Network, a new initiative launched via the couple's Archewell Foundation that offers a free support network for parents whose children have been negatively affected by social media. Per Harper's Bazaar, \"While a pilot program of the initiative was introduced two years ago, the network is now available to parents living in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada.\"\n\n\"When you\u2019ve been through any level of pain or trauma, I believe part of our healing journey\u2014certainly part of mine\u2014is being able to be really open about it,\" Meghan says during the convo. \"I really scraped the surface on my experience, but I do think that I would never want someone else to feel that way, and I would never want someone else to be making those sort of plans, and I would never want someone else to not be believed.\"\n\nFor more deets on the interview, head right this way:\n\nRelated Story Meghan Markle on Protecting Her Children Online\n\nAugust 18,
