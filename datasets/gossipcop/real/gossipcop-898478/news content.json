{"url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/jennifer-lawrence-interview-by-oprah-winfrey-1064576", "text": "Oprah Winfrey barely knew Jennifer Lawrence when the actress called and said she\u2019d like to meet and then on Oct. 5 drove to see Winfrey at her Montecito, California, home. \u201cI was excited to have lunch, and we were just like \u2018girls in the garden,'\u201d says Winfrey. \u201cWe probably talked for three and a half hours about life and fame and growing up and money and management and taking care of yourself and spirituality and philosophy. We drank ros\u00e9, and we laughed, and we talked about everything.\u201d\n\nAlmost everything. One thing they didn\u2019t discuss was Harvey Weinstein, whose history of harassment and assault exploded into view that day, when The New York Times first detailed it. But Weinstein became a focal point of the two women\u2019s conversation a few weeks later, when THR asked Winfrey, 63, to interview Lawrence for this Women in Entertainment issue. That was shortly before the 27-year-old actress was to receive the Sherry Lansing Leadership Award at THR\u2018s annual Power 100 breakfast, an award Winfrey received in 2013.\n\nSince their first meeting, the new friends have been texting back and forth. \u201cI sent her a copy of Wisdom of Sundays and, before that, Power of Now and A New Earth,\u201d notes Winfrey. \u201cWhat resonates with me is that, when you are talking to her, what you\u2019re seeing is the real thing. You\u2019re not seeing any pretense. She\u2019s asking all the right questions: \u2018How can I be used? How can I use this moment for something bigger than myself?'\u201d\n\nLawrence grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, and was propelled to fame with 2010\u2019s Winter\u2019s Bone. The Hunger Games made her a global superstar, along with roles in Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle and the X-Men series. But it\u2019s not so much her stardom and four Oscar nominations (with a win for Silver Linings) that make her the perfect recipient of the Lansing award; it\u2019s also her nonprofit endeavors. She\u2019s been tireless in supporting Kentucky charities and those that help children in particular.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason why Winfrey was so impressed by \u201chow much light [Lawrence] carries. Capital L, capital Light. You can feel there\u2019s a strong intelligence and a desire to use this moment for something greater than fame and fortune.\u201d\n\nOPRAH WINFREY I read this wonderful book by Elizabeth Strout [Anything Is Possible]. And in it, she was speaking about one of the characters who was so embittered and regretful, and the line she used was, \u201cbecause her life did not turn out the way she had expected.\u201d Is your life what you expected?\n\nJENNIFER LAWRENCE When I started acting, I was totally satisfied when I was on a sitcom because I had a steady paycheck. And I was like, \u201cMaybe I can just find a way to be on sitcoms forever.\u201d I was totally satisfied and good. I never dreamed that I could have this kind of career.\n\nWhen you dreamed the dream, what did the dream look like? I used to drive home from church with my father past rich white people\u2019s houses \u2014 we\u2019d be the last to leave our little church yard, and he\u2019d be in this big, old, green Oldsmobile that I was embarrassed to be in \u2014 and I\u2019d pick houses that I dreamed about living in, and that was a big dream for me: I\u2019d have a house, I\u2019d be able to pay my bills, I\u2019d have two cars in the driveway.\n\nI used to do that, too. I remember driving by big, beautiful houses, but I always dreamed of being there with my parents. I never imagined I\u2019d be able to own something like that on my own. I thought for a while maybe I could be an interior designer \u2014 that was the only job I knew about because my mom was friends with an interior designer. I was mostly just focused on a family when I was little. I would have never thought I\u2019d be so career-focused. It\u2019s not something I knew about myself until I started becoming successful, and then I wanted to become more successful. I\u2019d make a great movie, and then I\u2019d want to make more great movies; I\u2019d make money, I\u2019d want to make more money. It was a mind-set I wasn\u2019t ever aware I had until my early 20s.\n\nAnd then, by the time you\u2019re 27, you\u2019ve got [an Oscar]. By the time you\u2019ve gotten four [nominations], does it come with \u2014\n\nFear. You\u2019re immediately hit with fear. Or at least I was. I had been climbing and working and fighting, and I remember last year just getting hit with fear. All of a sudden it was, \u201cThey\u2019re going to get sick of me.\u201d That\u2019s when all my insecurity came. I\u2019ve been probably more insecure after last year, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just a feeling of: I\u2019ve got more to lose, I have more people to disappoint. I don\u2019t know how to explain it.\n\n[promo:1061158]\n\nWhen [mother! was] not [well received], [was that] disappointing?\n\nI read Twitter, and I was looking for bad mother! things. It was horrible. It was really bad. I loved this so much, and it just broke my heart, especially for Darren [Aronofsky, the film\u2019s writer-director and Lawrence\u2019s ex] because he loved this person. And any time you\u2019re in a relationship, their pain is your pain.\n\nYou\u2019re trolling for bad news?!\n\nI didn\u2019t know that\u2019s what I was doing. I don\u2019t know how to look up these things. I started twittering \u201cmother!\u201d \u2019cause I didn\u2019t know how else to get news, and that was really bad.\n\nHow do you choose what you\u2019re going to do next?\n\nIt\u2019s chemistry. It\u2019s like meeting a boyfriend. Red Sparrow [March]was sexual, and I haven\u2019t done anything sexy or sexual. I\u2019ve been afraid of that since 2014, when I got my pictures hacked. I just thought, \u201cI\u2019ll never do that again. I\u2019ll never share that part of myself ever since it got shared against my will.\u201d And then when I said yes to Red Sparrow, I felt I was taking something back.\n\nWhen your pictures got exploited that way, did it feel like you\u2019d been robbed? Like you came home and your whole house had been invaded?\n\nI would much prefer my whole house to have been invaded. That\u2019s what\u2019s so scary about electronic [things]. I have such fear with my phone and my computer and electronics. It\u2019s taking somebody\u2019s intellectual property but also my body. It was violating on a sexual level.\n\nHas there been a woman\u2019s or a man\u2019s story that stood out for you among all the stories of harassment?\n\nNo. They are all horrible, and not one is more horrifying than the next. But being able to hear when the woman wore the microphone and Harvey was telling her to watch him shower \u2014 I felt sick in my bones for an entire day. I was just sick. I was just like, \u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d after hearing that. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to talk about abuse, all of the different forms of abuse, because he didn\u2019t lay a finger on her, and I felt chilled to my bones. Imagine having a man who is that powerful telling you to do something [and] you\u2019re saying no. [He\u2019s] threatening you, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t embarrass me. We\u2019re at this hotel.\u201d\n\nThe implication is that if you won\u2019t give up five minutes of your time, you\u2019re going to lose your career.\n\nThen you\u2019re done.\n\nLast question on this subject: With all of these women and men coming forward, what ultimately would be the best result?\n\nSocial change. Men need more social awareness. But this comes down to equality, and until all women in every job are paid equally for the same amount of work, how are we ever going to be thought of as equals? As long as there is one group of humans that is overruling another one, there\u2019s going to be abuse, [and] why would we be thought of as equals? \u2026 My political passion has almost turned into an obsession. I mean, I don\u2019t think you ever do feel settled, [but] as soon as you feel settled with your home and your personal life, you\u2019re looking at the world and going, \u201cHow in the hell do I fix this? What do we do?\u201d\n\n[promo:1063312]\n\nHave you met Trump?\n\nNo, never.\n\nDo you want to?\n\nI think so. I\u2019ve got a pretty good speech. And it ends with a martini to the face. (Laughter.) I have something to say for all of them. I watch different characters on the news, and I\u2019m like, \u201cYou just wait.\u201d\n\nIf that moment comes, you would be prepared?\n\nOh, I would, definitely. Oh, my God, I\u2019ve been waiting for this moment. I\u2019ll give you a hint \u2014 it\u2019s not nice. You wouldn\u2019t want me to say it to you.\n\nYou are politically frustrated \u2014 we talked about that at lunch. This moment is a moment that forces us all to show up. So how will you show up?\n\nI\u2019ve started with simply trying to raise money for the organiza\u00adtion [Represent.Us] that I\u2019m on the board of directors of. And then I\u2019m going to go on campus tours. I want to be talking to high schoolers and college students. I want to travel around to the areas I\u2019m from so that people realize that corruption is a completely nonpartisan issue. And we want to hold a press conference where the only people who are asking the questions are the high schoolers and the college students. I would [also] love to help pass a bundle of laws [against government corruption]. We\u2019d be able to pass state-by-state legislation to help [stop] corruption in our government. I would love to pass laws that help celebrity parents be able to take their kids to places without having to worry about paparazzi.\n\nHow do you create a personal life?\n\nIt\u2019s really not hard. People imagine my life being [different]. It\u2019s actually pretty normal. I drove myself to the laser hair removal today. (Laughter.) I have always been a homebody. My social life has always been very boring: I sit around outside my house with my friends and drink wine, and that hasn\u2019t really changed. I don\u2019t really like to go out. I have friends who come and visit me when I\u2019m on sets. It\u2019s just annoying because you have to work 13-, 14-hour days. So sometimes it\u2019s not nice to have my friends there, just because I feel bad and I have to work. I actually have the most amazing neighborhood tribe. My neighborhood is like a village. The women are sharing breast milk. Zoe Saldana just came and got an onion from me [the other day]. Cameron Diaz and I went on a hike [recently].\n\nReally? People are borrowing onions? Nobody borrows sugar anymore. It\u2019s like, \u201cMay I have an onion and some kale?\u201d\n\n(Laughter.) Exactly. I made chicken broth.\n\nPeople who really know you use what adjectives to describe you?\n\nCrazy. Honest. I\u2019m sure everybody would agree that I am honest and loyal, but they would also all agree that I\u2019m crazy. Committed. Most of my friends are married, and I\u2019m still over at their house every night like we\u2019re all married, all three of us. So the commitment is strong.\n\nThree people you\u2019d like to have at a dinner party, living or dead?\n\nScott Disick [from Keeping Up With the Kardashians], Luann from Real Housewives of New York, Bethenny Frankel. And I\u2019m not proud of that, but that\u2019s what comes from my heart.\n\n[promo:1063489]\n\nIf you had a seance, who would you want to contact?\n\nA seance? Oh, no! I just thought about friends. Abraham Lincoln. I\u2019d ask him to be president, I\u2019d ask him to run. I guess you\u2019d ask him, \u201cHow did you face such opposition so bravely?\u201d And then he\u2019ll say, \u201cWell, I got shot in the head for it, Jennifer.\u201d\n\nAre you more traditional or more modern?\n\nMy house is probably the exact blend of both. Probably leaning a little bit more traditional. I\u2019m infatuated with my house. I don\u2019t even like L.A., I just like my house here, and I don\u2019t ever really leave. But it never feels done.\n\nDo you have a favorite possession?\n\nNo. I\u2019m the opposite of a hoarder. I don\u2019t hang on to enough stuff. I mean, my most prized possession, my most cherished thing in the world, is my one and only daughter, Pippi [her dog].\n\nA favorite quote?\n\nMy favorite quote that\u2019s going on my tombstone, and I wrote this myself, probably stoned, is: \u201cI definitely shouldn\u2019t have done it, but I am at peace with knowing that I couldn\u2019t not.\u201d That started over me sending dub smashes \u2014 they\u2019re like jokey videos \u2014 to Robert De Niro, who was fully not getting it. And the more he wasn\u2019t getting it, the funnier I thought it was, and I kept leaning into it. I shouldn\u2019t have done it, but I\u2019m at peace with knowing that I couldn\u2019t not. (Laughter.)\n\nFill in this blank. Twenty years from now, the world will be \u2026\n\nFair. (Laughs.) No, it\u2019ll be a carnival. It\u2019ll be a big zoo. Fair. That covers hunger, it covers a lot of bases.\n\nTwenty years from now, I will be \u2026\n\nI won\u2019t have periods anymore. That\u2019s a bonus.\n\nYeah, you will.\n\nFuck.\n\nDo you have a favorite joke?\n\nThis one New Yorker cartoon really got me. This man was at his mother\u2019s funeral, and it was just a cartoon of him at the pulpit, and he said, \u201cMother wouldn\u2019t have wanted us to feel sad, she would\u2019ve wanted us to feel guilty.\u201d (Laughter.)\n\nWhat\u2019s the lesson that has taken you the longest to learn?\n\nI\u2019m still learning to slow down. My thoughts are so gigantic. I go from one small idea to 40 years from now, and I overthink everything, and nothing actually gets done. Worrying does nothing. So living in the moment and taking everything step by step is something I have not mastered. I am still working at it.\n\nThe lesson you would want to teach your younger self is \u2026?\n\nI would probably just say, \u201cCalm the fuck down.\u201d I would get so nervous. I was 21, going through world press tours, and it\u2019s just embarrassing. You don\u2019t want to see yourself at 21 being ridiculous.\n\nHow do you ground yourself, center yourself?\n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve gotten there yet. I don\u2019t know if I do.\n\nAre you happy?\n\nYes.\n\nAre you fulfilled?\n\nYes. Not all the time, but overall, yeah.\n\nAre you religious, spiritual or both?\n\nNeither. I guess I am spiritual. I\u2019m not religious. I grew up very religious. I have a religious family, but I don\u2019t believe in anything. I wouldn\u2019t call myself an atheist. I just believe in that thing, that something, whatever it is, that I do believe in. I don\u2019t think it identifies as a man. To argue over what it is is ridiculous because none of us have the answer. I pray, it\u2019s just I\u2019m not praying to anybody specific. I grew up praying every night before bed, so I still sometimes do that, and it\u2019s a good checking-in time. But I was in a plane that had double-engine failure, and I was praying to God.\n\nWhether you believe in Him or not. (Laughter.)\n\nWhether I believe in Him or not! I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re out there, but if you are, please, please [save] the airplane.\u201d\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nWhy THR Chose Jennifer Lawrence as This Year\u2019s Sherry Lansing Leadership Award Recipient\n\nFrom the very start of her career, the 27-year-old Oscar-winning actress has demonstrated fierce commitment to fairness and opportunity in Hollywood and beyond. \u2014 by Brian Porreca\n\nOn Dec. 6, at THR\u2019s Women in Entertainment Breakfast, the Sherry Lansing Leadership Award \u2014 previously bestowed upon such industry vets as Barbra Streisand, Shonda Rhimes, Oprah Winfrey and Jane Fonda \u2014 will go to an actress born the year Ghost came out. But then Lawrence has accomplished more than most in her 27 years: She\u2019s won an Oscar, headlined her own billion-dollar franchise and led the debate on pay equity. She has also become one of Hollywood\u2019s most active philanthropists.\n\nSOCIAL JUSTICE\n\nEarly in her career, she began giving back alongside her Hunger Games co-stars to causes including the United Nations World Food Program. And when her star shot up, she started the Jennifer Lawrence Foundation. While it helps a variety of organizations, there is a focus on those supporting youth and children: the Boys and Girls Club, Make-a-Wish Foundation, Kids Cancer Alliance, Uspiritus, St. Mary\u2019s Center and West End Boys School, among others. Most recently, she joined the board of Represent.Us, the nation\u2019s largest grassroots anti-corruption campaign.\n\nHOMETOWN HERO\n\nIn 2016, the Oscar winner and four-time nominee donated $2 million to create the Jennifer Lawrence Foundation Cardiac Intensive Care Unit at Norton Children\u2019s Hospital in her hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. She also created the Jennifer Lawrence Arts Fund, which has funded more than $1 million toward arts education in Louisville. In November, the fund provided $100,000 in grants, including $50,000 for the city\u2019s renowned Actors Theatre of Louisville.\n\nHOLLYWOOD EQUITY\n\nIt was the hack heard round the world in 2014, and for Lawrence, Sony emails revealed that she and Amy Adams were paid less than their male co-stars in American Hustle. After that, she negotiated hard with the studio for her $20 million payday (more than Chris Pratt\u2019s) in Passengers. In 2015, she became a leading voice on the issue of pay parity when she shared her experience in an essay \u2014 \u201cWhy Do I Make Less Than My Male Co-Stars?\u201d \u2014 for Lena Dunham\u2019s Lenny Letter. \u201cWhen the Sony hack happened and I found out how much less I was being paid than the lucky people with dicks, I didn\u2019t get mad at Sony,\u201d Lawrence wrote. \u201cI got mad at myself.\u201d\n\nThis story first appeared in the 2017 Women in Entertainment Power 100 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
