I have bipolar disorder and suffered a severe episode at the end of January 2018,\u201d the post read. \u201cIt led to me experiencing a psychotic break from reality, during which time, I went missing with my dog, Cindy.\u201d\n\nJulia thanked her loved ones and \u201cgood Samaritans\u201d who helped her during the frightening ordeal, also revealing that she is \u201cgrateful for the treatment and care\u201d she is receiving for her mental illness.\n\n\u201cI would like to thank every person involved in the search for us for your incredible outpouring of support and love,\u201d she added. \u201cOn my road to recovery, I am hoping to help raise awareness of mental health disorders, including fighting the stigmatization of these illnesses that affect so many. I proudly stand with you. \u2014 With love and gratitude, Julia Kebbel.\u201d\n\nIn a Feb. 3 Instagram post, Kebbel sent out an alert that her sister had gone missing in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles while walking her chocolate Labrador retriever. The actress went on to file an official missing persons report with the LAPD. Two weeks later, Kebbel shared the news that her sister and dog had been found.\n\n\u201cIt is with great joy and relief that I share the wonderful news that my sister, Julia, and her dog, Cindy, have been found safe,\u201d the actress wrote on Instagram. \u201cWhile we do ask for privacy at this time, my family and I want to thank everyone for all of your love and support over the past two weeks. We are so grateful to every single person who helped spread the word and joined us in our search. We would also like to thank the Los Angeles Police Department, KlaasKIDS, SERT Ministries and Anonymity Rescue for their efforts in bringing Julia home.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arielle_kebbel.jpg?w=2000&h=1126&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arielle_kebbel.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arielle_kebbel.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lexy Perez", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/arielle-kebbels-sister-reveals-disappearance-took-place-psychotic-break-1094400/", "title": "Arielle Kebbel\u2019s Sister Reveals Disappearance Took Place During \u201cPsychotic Break\u201d", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "After being reported missing by her sister, Julia Kebbel shared that her bipolar disorder influenced her and her dog going missing in January.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Lexy Perez", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Arielle Kebbel\u2019s Sister Reveals Disappearance Took Place During \u201cPsychotic Break\u201d", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/arielle-kebbels-sister-reveals-disappearance-took-place-psychotic-break-1094400/", "description": "After being reported missing by her sister, Julia Kebbel shared that her bipolar disorder influenced her and her dog going missing in January.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arielle_kebbel.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Arielle Kebbel's Sister Reveals Disappearance Took Place During \"Psychotic Break\""}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-14T08:45:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-15T09:28:37+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "After being reported missing by her sister, Julia Kebbel shared that her bipolar disorder influenced her and her dog going missing in January.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Arielle Kebbel\u2019s Sister Reveals Disappearance Took Place During \u201cPsychotic Break\u201d", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/arielle_kebbel.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521017156.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
