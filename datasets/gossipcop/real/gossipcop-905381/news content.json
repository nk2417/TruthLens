Serena lays her on a play mat in the TV room so that they can do some tandem exercises while Chip, the Yorkie, runs in circles around them, eager to get in on the action. Mother tests out a few crunches, but her stomach is still too weak; baby kicks out her chubby legs a few times, which proves irresistible to Serena, who rolls over and grabs them. \u201cThey\u2019re not calves!\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re not ankles! What are they? That\u2019s right\u2014Mommy loves your cankles!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she got them from me,\u201d says Alexis, overhearing, from the next room.\n\nOlympia tries to wriggle out of the baby gym, with its dumbbell-shaped rattles, but Serena says not so fast. \u201cSome other seven-week-old is in the gym right now working,\u201d she jokes. But she has no wish to push her daughter onto the court. To her mother\u2019s horror, Olympia sat transfixed by the Argentine star Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro recently. \u201cI was distraught when I saw her,\u201d says Se\u00adrena. \u201cI would hate her to have to deal with comparisons or expectations. It\u2019s so much work, and I\u2019ve given up so much. I don\u2019t regret it, but it\u2019s like Sliding Doors: Go through a different door and lead a different life. I\u2019d like her to have a normal life. I didn\u2019t have that.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s obviously going to have a very special life,\u201d Alexis says, \u201cbut there are enough cautionary tales about kids who grow up in the spotlight. How do you make your kid live in reality when your own reality is so . . . unreal? This kid is going to have more Instagram followers than me in about three weeks.\u201d (At press time, baby was narrowing her father\u2019s lead.)\n\nThe biggest question in women\u2019s tennis last year was who would end up number one in Serena\u2019s absence, and the answer didn\u2019t become clear until the penultimate day of the season, when Serena\u2019s friend Simona Halep, of Romania, snuck off with the crown. It could have been anybody, really, including the tour\u2019s elder stateswoman, Venus Williams, who at age 37 was a couple of victories from the number-one ranking. The fact that Venus\u2019s extraordinary year coincided with Serena\u2019s absence from the tour is not lost on her younger sister. \u201cI know that her career might have been different if she had had my health,\u201d Serena says, clinging to the fantasy of sisterly parity. \u201cI know how hard she works. I hate playing her because she gets this look on her face where she just looks sad if she\u2019s losing. Solemn. It breaks my heart. So when I play her now, I absolutely don\u2019t look at her, because if she gets that look, then I\u2019ll start feeling bad, and the next thing you know I\u2019ll be losing. I think that\u2019s when the turning point came in our rivalry, when I stopped looking at her.\u201d", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68fb9567089ae6d8f133348f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/690089fd477c1c84a2336e4f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6904860c38077846c2240e7a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68f7927c177117ab738f5c0a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68f8ca6776585aea986614cb/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68faa3ee3a3a14c75d0bd2f7/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e04719d517509a5790e4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/05-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/690789201f0e6c73e1b7f227/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68fba3f105fdf9cf6d556002/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e046fb207660fa92173f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/02-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68f7be439c0df95a303490b3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68f80b9ad01b50baf927096c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/us/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e047faf3bc4e2b3fab56/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/01-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6900fe5fc267f71afdd72db5/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e0463ebd0571fa0cd192/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/03-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/69028da787d02bc04df9c035/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e04719d517509a5790e4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/05-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rob Haskell", "Mario Testino"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-vogue-cover-interview-february-2018", "title": "Serena Williams on Motherhood, Marriage, and Making Her Comeback", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Rob Haskell", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Serena Williams, Vogue\u2019s February 2018 cover star discusses her difficult delivery for the first time and when she hopes to make her triumphant return to tennis.", "id": "5a54ddd4faf3bc4e2b3fab54", "keywords": "serena williams", "news_keywords": "serena williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=289380413, app-argument=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id289380413?pt=45076&ct=VOG_Smart_Banner&mt=8", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a54ddd4faf3bc4e2b3fab54", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Serena Williams, Vogue\u2019s February 2018 cover star discusses her difficult delivery for the first time and when she hopes to make her triumphant return to tennis.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e065c5a4191ce869177d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/07-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e065c5a4191ce869177d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/07-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg\"}", "og": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e04719d517509a5790e4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/05-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Serena Williams on Motherhood, Marriage, and Making Her Comeback", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-vogue-cover-interview-february-2018"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-01-10T13:00:16.573Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-10T13:00:16.573Z", "author": "Rob Haskell,Mario Testino"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e04719d517509a5790e4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/05-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Serena Williams on Motherhood, Marriage, and Making Her Comeback"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e04719d517509a5790e4/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/05-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515589216.573, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
