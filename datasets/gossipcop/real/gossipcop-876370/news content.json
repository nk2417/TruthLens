E! reports that was because she was backstage, changing into one of her 10 outfits for the night.\n\nShe was very aware of what was happening though. \"Everyone backstage was going insane over it, and a few people gave her the highlights,\" a source told the outlet. \"Knowing Katy, I'm sure she has seen it by now.\"\n\nThe source emphasized that Perry really, really, really doesn\u2019t want to be part of the Taylor Swift feud narrative anymore. \"Katy wants the Taylor war to be in the past and she is focused on moving forward,\" the source said.\n\nBut Swift is the one thing stopping that from happening. \"Katy wants to be cool with Taylor, but [Taylor] isn't budging,\" the source said. \"Katy is focusing on herself and her upcoming tour right now and doesn't want any bad energy.\"\n\nPerry also wasn\u2019t bothered that\u2014despite rumors up until the beginning of the ceremony that Swift may make an appearance (she\u2019s \"ready to come out of hiding,\" a source told People in an article posted shortly before the show started)\u2014Swift didn\u2019t come or make peace with Perry on stage. \"Katy knew well beforehand that Taylor wasn't going to show, and it didn't faze her,\" the source explained.\n\n\"She was in a good mood and really didn't care if Taylor was going to show up or not. This was her time to shine and really make an appearance for herself. She didn't want to let anyone down, so she kept a positive attitude.\"", "images": ["https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/envelope-simple-regular.91a0134.svg",
