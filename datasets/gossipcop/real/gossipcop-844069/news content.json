But other times, in the strongest moments \u2013 maybe through the words of Alice Cooper or Freddie Mercury, through Cronenberg films, or even in Chewbacca\u2019s growl, I experienced something deeper \u2013 the realization that I wasn\u2019t completely alone.\u201d\n\nGunn stressed to fans who may feel how he once felt that they are not alone.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a group of heartbroken misfits whose lives have been bereft of tenderness and connection and who have a nearly impossible time trusting themselves or others,\u201d Gunn wrote. \u201cBut they\u2019re learning, one step at a time. They are me. They are you. We are Groot.\u201d\n\nGunn expressed his heartfelt thanks to fans around the world for flocking to theaters to see his latest film.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 shot to $56.3 million Friday for a weekend debut in the $140 million range at the North American box office.\n\nRead Gunn\u2019s full post below.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/gettyimages-670489464_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/gettyimages-670489464_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Parker", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/james-gunn-opens-up-lengthy-heartfelt-message-fans-1000871/", "title": "James Gunn Opens Up in Lengthy, Heartfelt Message to Fans", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "&quot;Suddenly I could see past the bland suburbs where I lived into a more magical world, a world more aligned with what I imagined.&quot;", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Ryan Parker", "tags": "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, James Gunn", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "James Gunn Opens Up in Lengthy, Heartfelt Message to Fans", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/james-gunn-opens-up-lengthy-heartfelt-message-fans-1000871/", "description": "\"Suddenly I could see past the bland suburbs where I lived into a more magical world, a world more aligned with what I imagined.\"", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/gettyimages-670489464_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "James Gunn Opens Up in Lengthy, Heartfelt Message to Fans"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-06T13:33:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-05-06T23:46:43+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Suddenly I could see past the bland suburbs where I lived into a more magical world, a world more aligned with what I imagined.\"", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "James Gunn Opens Up in Lengthy, Heartfelt Message to Fans", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/gettyimages-670489464_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494077607.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
