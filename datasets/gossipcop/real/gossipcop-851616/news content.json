The family and I appreciate your kindness. Our only hope is that the tragic assassination of our young nephew, Reinaldo and his colleague, Fabrizio will serve to mitigate the terrible carnage and murders that are committed against our youth in Venezuela. The Electoral Results must be respected. The Communist Dictatorship must go,\u201d Herrera wrote in a post on her brand\u2019s Instagram account, @houseofherrera, which has 1.7 million followers.\n\nAccording to reports, Reinaldo Herrera, 34, and his colleague Fabrizio Mendoza, 31, were discovered Thursday after an apparent kidnapping in an abandoned vehicle on a highway that connects Caracas to the Caribbean coast.\n\n\u201cCarolina and Reinaldo Herrera and their family are deeply devastated by this tragedy. They are not available for further comment. The family requests privacy as they grieve,\u201d said a spokeswoman for Carolina Herrera when reached for comment Saturday.\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nHerrera\u2019s Instagram post was the most outspoken the Venezuelan-born designer has been publicly about the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.
