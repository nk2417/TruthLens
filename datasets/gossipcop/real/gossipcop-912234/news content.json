And that includes the film\u2019s climatic helicopter chase scene.\n\nIn an interview for the film\u2019s upcoming Blu-Ray release, Cruise\u2019s leading lady in the film, Rebecca Ferguson, discussed a scene where Cruise\u2019s character, Ethan Hunt, dangles from the underside of a flying helicopter. Then, Ethan loses his grip on the helicopter, dropping onto a cargo load being lifted by the helicopter and grabbing onto it to avoid plummeting to his death in the canyon below.\n\nFerguson saw Cruise as he did the fall and, not noticing that he had a safety harness, thought that he had just killed himself.\n\n\u201cI heard myself scream. I actually thought he fell,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere was an audible gasp from the crowd. That\u2019s a huge drop,\u201d co-star Henry Cavill added in the Blu-Ray interview.\n\nWhat was worse for Cruise is that he shot that stunt five times, only to move on to another death-defying sequence in which he flew a helicopter through the mountains at low-altitude for a chase scene that required him to get dangerously close to another helicopter.\n\nOh, and he also performed the highest free fall skydive ever filmed for a movie and broke his leg while jumping between buildings in London. As we noted this past summer, you wouldn\u2019t be faulted for thinking that Tom Cruise might have a death wish.\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout\u201d is available on Digital Nov. 20, and on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD on Dec. 4.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5x4_082025_COVER.jpg?fit=240%2C300&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MissionImpossibleFalloutTomCruise-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeremy-Fuster.png?resize=150%2C150&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeremy-Fuster.png?fit=53%2C58&quality=80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MissionImpossibleFalloutTomCruise-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeremy Fuster", "Film Reporter", "Joined Thewrap In", "Covers Box Office", "Labor News.
