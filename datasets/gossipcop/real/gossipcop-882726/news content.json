Sydney\u2019s husband, MLB player Anthony Bass, is out on the road playing, so the baby\u2019s uncles, Eric, and Jessie\u2019s brother, John, stop by to build a crib.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so great to have my family live in the same exact town as me, because I can always lean on them and depend on them if I need anything,\u201d Sydney shares.\n\nBut maybe she shouldn\u2019t lean on Eric and John for furniture construction. The duo struggles to put the crib together, with a new side falling off every time they add a piece.\n\nTune into Eric & Jessie on Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET to see if the guys pull it together.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/eric.jpg?h=6a65bc15&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/eric.jpg?h=6a65bc15", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-09/eric-jessie-4_1.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/eric.jpg?h=6a65bc15", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/exclusive-eric-jessie-sneak-peek-eric-hilariously-fails-building-crib-88073", "title": "EXCLUSIVE \u2018Eric & Jessie\u2019 Sneak Peek: Eric Hilariously Fails at Building a Crib", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/eric.jpg?h=6a65bc15", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "With two kids of his own, you\u2019d think the NFL star would know how to do this by now!", "title": "EXCLUSIVE \u2018Eric & Jessie\u2019 Sneak Peek: Eric Hilariously Fails at Building a Crib", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/exclusive-eric-jessie-sneak-peek-eric-hilariously-fails-building-crib-88073", "type": "Article"}, "description": "With two kids of his own, you\u2019d think the NFL star would know how to do this by now!", "twitter": {"description": "With two kids of his own, you\u2019d think the NFL star would know how to do this by now!", "title": "EXCLUSIVE \u2018Eric & Jessie\u2019 Sneak Peek: Eric Hilariously Fails at Building a Crib", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/exclusive-eric-jessie-sneak-peek-eric-hilariously-fails-building-crib-88073", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/eric.jpg?h=6a65bc15", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "EXCLUSIVE \u2018Eric & Jessie\u2019 Sneak Peek: Eric Hilariously Fails at Building a Crib | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, , Eric Decker, Jessie James Decker", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
