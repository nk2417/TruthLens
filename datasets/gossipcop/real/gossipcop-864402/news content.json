However, there has been one part of the ride that has remained controversial: the bride auction scene.\n\nWhat may have been okay in the \u201960s is now a bit insensitive and \u2014 let\u2019s be honest \u2014 very misogynistic. Now that Disney has become aware of this, the scene that once had a redheaded character named Redd as part of a \u201cwench sale\u201d with signs that read \u201cAuction take a wench for a bride\u201d has changed with the times. Redd will now be a pirate who\u2019s just pillaged the town\u2019s rum supply and has something to say about it.\n\nThe Pirates of the Caribbean attraction at the Magic Kingdom recently received this makeover. The park reopened the new version of the ride on March 19 after they announced the changes last summer. Disneyland Paris received a similar revision last year while Anaheim\u2019s Disneyland will get the makeover later this spring with work starting on April 23.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nTake a look at the preview of the new and improved auction scene below.", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/auction.jpg?w=1024", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bnhsgetr-624x3521.jpg", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/auction.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/auction.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dino-Ray Ramos", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/03/pirates-of-the-caribbean-ride-disneyland-wench-bride-auction-scene-1202351071/", "title": "Disneyland\u2019s Pirates Of The Caribbean Ride Makes Some Changes To Controversial Bride Auction Scene", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Ever since Disneyland first opened the Pirates of the Caribbean ride in 1967, the attraction has become blockbuster movie franchise and a must-see for all who enter the gates of any of the Disney parks around the world.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Dino-Ray Ramos", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Disneyland\u2019s Pirates Of The Caribbean Ride Makes Some Changes To Controversial Bride Auction Scene", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/03/pirates-of-the-caribbean-ride-disneyland-wench-bride-auction-scene-1202351071/", "description": "Ever since Disneyland first opened the Pirates of the Caribbean ride in 1967, the attraction has become blockbuster movie franchise and a must-see for all who enter the gates of any of the Disney parks around the world.
