Just like her husband, she often ignores guidance from aides in favor of her own instincts, and directs her staff to fight back against news media coverage she dislikes. (Ms. Grisham insisted that the White House furniture replacement was a joint husband-and-wife effort. \u201cThey both chose the d\u00e9cor,\u201d she said.)\n\nBut Mrs. Trump remains a Rorschach test for public perceptions of Mr. Trump\u2019s White House: People tend to see in her what they already believe about the president. To conservative supporters of the president, she is a quietly loyal helpmate. To Mr. Trump\u2019s critics, she is an enabler trapped in a gilded cage, occasionally breaking out to express a divergent opinion or make a high-profile gaffe before retreating again into silence.\n\nIn June, the Slovenian-born Mrs. Trump, 48, was the only senior administration official to visit multiple detention facilities near the United States\u2019 border with Mexico after thousands of migrant children were separated from their parents as part of the administration\u2019s \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policies. But any good intentions were overshadowed by her decision to wear a jacket emblazoned with the phrase \u201cI REALLY DON\u2019T CARE, DO U?\u201d on an official trip to Texas. It was widely seen as inappropriate, insensitive and unbecoming of her office.\n\nMr. Trump seized on the moment to say his wife was addressing the news media, but a person close to Mrs. Trump said the jacket was actually directed at anyone \u2014 both outside and inside the White House \u2014 who wanted to criticize her decision to visit the children in light of the administration\u2019s aggressive immigration policies. The East Wing insisted the jacket had no underlying message.\n\n\u201cNo one tells the first lady what to do,\u201d Ms. Grisham said. \u201cOur office has nothing to do with what clothing choices she makes and this situation was no different.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/12/multimedia/author-katie-rogers/author-katie-rogers-thumbLarge-v2.png",
