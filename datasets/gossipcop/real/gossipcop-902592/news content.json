I\u2019ve won the lotto!\u201d \u2013 he had a face like thunder for the entire ceremony and the reception.\n\nThings even took a further dive when after kissing his new missus, he wiped her lipstick off his mouth and said \u201cgross\u201d.\n\nSpeaking to The Fix, Sean shared the criteria he had given producers for his dream partner.\n\nHe said: \u201cSomeone who\u2019s funny. Someone\u2019s who loyal. Someone who wants to have good fun. Having someone to go and have fun with and do different things and learn different things. And someone who\u2019s trustworthy.\u201d\n\nBut despite Jo ticking all the boxes, he simply didn\u2019t fancy her.\n\nSadly for Jo, she really did think she had struck gold with her mystery man.\n\nAt the wedding she said: \u201cHe\u2019s got kind eyes. He seems genuine. I fancy him.\n\n\u201cThis could work. My expectations have been met and then some. To infinity and beyond\u2026 Sean D and Jo sitting in a tree.\n\n\u201cMy expectations have been met, and then some. To infinity and beyond. Winning! Jackpot! I\u2019ve won the lotto!\n\n\u201cThe experts have been spot on! He is for me. He couldn\u2019t be any more perfect.\u201d\n\nBut Sean felt very differently, which made for awkward viewing for people at home.\n\nHe said, \u201cUm, she\u2019s probably not what I imagined, no.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not like a massive spark straight away, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019s feeling the same way.\u201d\n\nPeople tuned in at home were on the edge of their seats as the mismatched pair continued to totally misread one another\u2019s body language and reactions to each other.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DanBray_/status/958281260442374144\n\nHowever, Sean has since explained his frosty reaction to likeable Jo \u2013 it\u2019s all because of his exercise addict ex-girlfriend who he\u2019s still a bit hung up on.\n\nHe said that after she got addicted to exercise, their 10 year relationship ended and he was stuck caring for their plethora of pets including llamas and cats \u2013 and he is still traumatised and tired.\n\nSean said: \u201cWe had a five-acre property together, and she ran out of time for me and the animals.\n\n\u201cIt was really hard because I had to take responsibility of the farm. I got all the animals. When we broke up, we had nine dogs, two alpacas, and two horses.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult breaking up, it wasn\u2019t like either of us did anything wrong \u2013 there was no cheating or anything like that.\n\n\u201cShe became a fitness freak but was just crazy. We slowly drifted apart and that was it, we were done.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t need to go Down Under to find a rocky marriage\u2026 this woman was divorced thirteen days after her wedding when she found out her husband was a paedophile.\n\nThis woman\u2019s sugar daddy turned out to be a serial con man.\n\nAnd we revealed how Posh Spice is livid about hubby David jetting off to Miami on business.", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-1195.png?w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000381976396.jpg?strip=all&w=649", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000381976395.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TOB-18_11-kelly-brook-comp_182572.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000381976971.jpg?strip=all&w=897", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/newspress-collage-kht0gzrnn-1763544630846.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1763544644&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RB-19-11-APP_COMP_2474a9.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/af-composite-wedding.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/married.jpg?quality=90&strip=all", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000381976397.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000381976970.jpg?strip=all&w=912", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000381976392.jpg?strip=all&w=960"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/af-composite-wedding.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/5472000/married-at-first-sight-sean-jo-disappointed/", "title": "Watch the moment a disappointed groom mutters \u2018oh s**t\u2019 as he sees his bride for the first time on Married At First Sight", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
