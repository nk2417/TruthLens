Her pelvic bone-baring dress at the 2014 MuchMusic awards and her thong-showcasing look at the 2017 Met Gala is evidence of that. But apparently, her approach to fashion might be a reflection of the types of photo shoots she wants to do, but doesn't get to as often as she's like.\n\nIn a recent episode of famed photographer Mario Testino's podcast, Jenner opened up about her desire to do more sexy work \u2014 an area she claims she doesn't generally get to explore. \"I don't get to be hot very often,\" Jenner told Testino, as reported by People. \"I love going like, sexual, because I don't get to do it.\"\n\nTestino offered a possible explanation for Jenner's lack of \"sexual\" work: \"It's so weird because you have the body,\" he said. \"I think that maybe people are intimidated to take you there. Maybe you've done a lot of American Vogue and it's not about that and it's more about clothes.\"\n\nThat's not to say Jenner hasn't had her share of revealing photo shoots, runway work, and Instagram candids. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and Victoria's Secret angel has even found her ways around Insta's no-nipples policy in the past. \"I love my tits being out,\" she previously told W.\n\nBut for now, Jenner just hopes that the modeling industry will be willing to take more risks when it comes to conceptualizing her work. \"I love being transformed,\" she told Testino. \"Everyone always wants to make me myself.\"", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1",
