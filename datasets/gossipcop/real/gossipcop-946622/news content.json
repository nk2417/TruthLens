Schulman denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cAlthough we never received a formal complaint, MTV and Critical Content immediately engaged an independent third party investigator,\u201d MTV said in a statement to ET. \u201cThe independent investigator found the allegations made in the YouTube videos to be not credible and without merit.\u201d\n\n\u201cGiven the results of the investigation, Catfish will resume filming. We take these matters very seriously and are committed to providing a safe working environment,\" the statement concludes.\n\nSchulman also took to Twitter to thank fans for having his back.\n\n\"Appreciate the support from you and so many others. Excited to get back to work!\" he tweeted. \"Can\u2019t express how much your support means to me. ?.\"\n\nIn a YouTube video posted on May 12, Ayissha Morgan, who appeared on the show in 2015, went public with her accusations, claiming that the show's \"main person\" relentlessly hit on her during production of her episode, questioned her about being a lesbian and also propositioned her for sex.\n\nIn a statement to ET at the time, an MTV spokesperson said the network was conducting an investigation, and that production on the show had been paused.\n\n\u201cWe take these allegations very seriously,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWe\u2019re working with Critical Content, our third party production company, to conduct a thorough investigation, and we\u2019ve put a pause on shooting until the investigation is completed.\u201d\n\nSchulman denied the allegations in his own statement, writing, \"The behavior described in this video did not happen and I'm fortunate that there are a number of former colleagues who were present during this time period who are willing to speak up with the truth. I have always been transparent about my life and would always take responsibility for my actions -- but these claims are false.\u201d\n\nSchulman has been the host and executive producer of Catfish since 2012. In the show, Schulman and his filmmaking partner, Max Joseph, investigate whether people are telling the truth about who they say they are in their online relationships.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-05/1280_neve_schulman_gettyimages_665547216.jpg?h=4a7d1ed4&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-06/gettyimages-988303756.jpg?h=25a2d821&width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/nev_schulman_gettyimages-841247854.jpg?h=4320a5fa", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/nev_schulman_gettyimages-841247854.jpg?h=4320a5fa&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2016-10/1280_nev_schulman_laura_perlongo_Getty606988946.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/nev_schulman_gettyimages-841247854.jpg?h=4320a5fa", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/catfish-to-resume-filming-after-nev-schulman-sexual-misconduct-claims-found-not-credible-104827", "title": "'Catfish' to Resume Filming After Nev Schulman Sexual Misconduct Claims Found 'Not Credible'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/nev_schulman_gettyimages-841247854.jpg?h=4320a5fa", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "MTV released a statement announcing that they would resume production on the reality show.", "title": "'Catfish' to Resume Filming After Nev Schulman Sexual Misconduct Claims Found 'Not Credible'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/catfish-to-resume-filming-after-nev-schulman-sexual-misconduct-claims-found-not-credible-104827", "type": "Article"}, "description": "MTV released a statement announcing that they would resume production on the reality show.", "twitter": {"description": "MTV released a statement announcing that they would resume production on the reality show.", "title": "'Catfish' to Resume Filming After Nev Schulman Sexual Misconduct Claims Found 'Not Credible'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/catfish-to-resume-filming-after-nev-schulman-sexual-misconduct-claims-found-not-credible-104827", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/nev_schulman_gettyimages-841247854.jpg?h=4320a5fa", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "'Catfish' to Resume Filming After Nev Schulman Sexual Misconduct Claims Found 'Not Credible' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, Catfish The Tv Show, Nev Schulman", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
