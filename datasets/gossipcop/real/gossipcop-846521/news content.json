If she breaks the bond she must pay A$1,000 ($770; \u00a3540).\n\nThe authorities also released an unusual video apology from the couple.\n\nIn the video, which was shown in court and made public by the Department of Agriculture, the couple expressed remorse, external and advised travellers to respect Australian quarantine laws.\n\nBizarre video apology sparks online mockery\n\nAustralia gripped by Terriergate\n\n#WarOnTerrier: How Australia reacted to Depp's dogs\n\nMs Heard and Mr Depp both attended Southport Magistrate's Court in Queensland state, amid a media scrum.\n\nHer guilty plea meant Mr Depp was excused from giving evidence to the court.\n\nTwo illegal importation charges against her were dropped earlier.\n\nThey had carried a maximum penalty of 10 years in jail or fines of up to A$265,000.", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/464/cpsprodpb/10BA7/production/_113191586_99f2b3a3-3d66-41ec-8edf-eb2088d7f565.jpg",
