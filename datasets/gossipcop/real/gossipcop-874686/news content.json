defeating Naomi to become SmackDown women's champion for the first time.\n\nOpinions were mixed on the result:\n\nNaomi would later congratulate the new champion on Twitter, while Natalya celebrated her big win:\n\nNattie emerged as an unlikely contender at Battleground by defeating Charlotte Flair, Becky Lynch, Lana and Tamina in a Fatal 5-Way elimination match to become Naomi's new challenger.\n\nWhile Natalya has long been among WWE's best female workers, she has often been lost in the shuffle on SmackDown Live and used in a supporting role rather than truly being elevated into title contention.\n\nHer legitimacy has never been questioned as the only female graduate of the Hart Dungeon, though, and she gained even more credibility by last eliminating Charlotte to win that match.\n\nNattie quickly took aim at Naomi, criticized her light-up title and suggested that she was making a mockery out of being champion.\n\nShe even took to Twitter to bad-mouth Naomi and announce her intentions for SummerSlam:\n\nNaomi has been considered one of WWE's most underrated performers for years, and it wasn't until recently that she was given an opportunity to reside at the top of the women's division.\n\nShe memorably won the SmackDown Women's Championship in her hometown of Orlando, Florida, at WrestleMania, but her booking has been highly inconsistent ever since.\n\nAside from a match against Charlotte for the title on SmackDown that was interrupted by The Welcoming Committee, Naomi didn't have much to hang her hat on in terms of significant matches until Sunday.\n\nNaomi's biggest feud prior to Nattie was a three-match series against Lana that included a bout at Money in the Bank.\n\nAll three contests were fairly short and weren't especially competitive, as Naomi prevailed against her far less experienced opponent.\n\nSunday's match offered a far greater challenge, however, since Nattie is one of the most veteran women on the entire roster.\n\nNatalya used that experience to her advantage, and by virtue of scoring the massive win, she and Naomi seem likely to engage in a long-term rivalry.", "images":
