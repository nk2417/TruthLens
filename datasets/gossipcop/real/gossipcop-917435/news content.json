Earlier this season on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, LVP told Dorit: \"I love you \u2014 mainly on the strength of loving your husband and wanting to love you and make it right.\" And now we're learning a bit more about that quip from Dorit: \"I think that that was twisted a little,\" she shared on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on Tuesday.\n\nHow to Watch The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Season 15 premieres on Thursday, December 4 at 8/7c on Bravo and streams next day on on Peacock. Stream on\n\nShe then revealed if she thinks she and LVP can bounce back from that comment. For that answer, you'll have to press play on the WWHL moment, above.\n\nRelated\n\nDorit previously addressed the moment in an interview with E! News, sharing, \"Lisa and I have a great friendship, but I've only known her a short amount of time compared to how long she's known my husband\u2014and they go way back. And all of their friends have known each other for, like, 30 years. So, they have a very different relationship and friendship.\"\n\nShe noted that \"she's a very, very dear friend of mine\" and did note that the connection to Lisa does come courtesy of PK. \"I came into my friendship with her because of my husband. So, I completely understand,\" she said. \"Of course, when it came out of her mouth I was like, \u2018That's not very nice! We have a far better friendship than that.'\"\n\nStay tuned to find out what's next for these ladies every Tuesday at 9/9c.
