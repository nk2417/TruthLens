What did I miss?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Erin has poked fun at David and McPhee\u2019s coupling.\n\nBack in September, as rumors of their romance popped up, Erin shared a photo of the two to her Instagram Stories alongside the captions, \u201cExcited about my new step mom,\u201d and \u201cMy parents.\u201d\n\nAt the time, a source close to David was denying his romance with McPhee \u2014 and another insider explained that \u201cErin\u2019s quite obviously tongue-in-cheek and sarcastic Instagram comments were pointed at those who can\u2019t seem to grasp that her dad and Kat can be colleagues, collaborators and longtime friends without it being some big romance.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t even perform together without people saying they\u2019re headed down the aisle,\u201d the source said. \u201cErin was messing with people who jump to conclusions.\u201d\n\nKatharine McPhee.\n\nBut Erin herself wasn\u2019t denying it. A month later, in October, she opened up about her dad\u2019s then-girlfriend on the red carpet of the BLEUSALT Launch Celebration in Malibu.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s amazing,\u201d Erin told PEOPLE of McPhee. \u201cI really like her. She\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cMy dad is kind of a hopeless romantic, and Katharine\u2019s awesome. We really, really like her, and we\u2019ve known her for a really long time. And if he\u2019s happy, we\u2019re happy.\u201d\n\nCharley Gallay/Getty\n\nDavid and McPhee first sparked romance rumors in May 2017 when the two were spotted enjoying a PDA-filled dinner date at Nobu in Malibu. The pair was also said to have traveled together (with McPhee\u2019s mom) not soon after on a Vancouver getaway.\n\nBefore finding romance, the two had a long friendship, with David first meeting the American Idol alum on the set of the hit reality singing competition when she was a contestant in 2006.\n\nMcPhee previously collaborated with the Grammy-winning producer for a few live performances, including his 2008 PBS tribute concert Hit Man: David Foster & Friends.\n\nThey eventually went public with their romance when they stepped out together at the 2018 Met Gala.\n\nKatharine McPhee and David Foster.

His past wives include B.J. Cook, Rebecca Dyer, Linda Thompson and Yolanda Hadid \u2014 from whom his divorce was finalized in 2017.\n\nShe was married to Nick Cokas, though the two divorced in 2016. David was in attendance at the couple\u2019s 2008 wedding, playing piano when Cokas sang Billy Joel\u2019s \u201cShe\u2019s Got a Way\u201d and McPhee returned the favor with a rendition of \u201cUnforgettable\u201d by Natalie Cole.", "images":
