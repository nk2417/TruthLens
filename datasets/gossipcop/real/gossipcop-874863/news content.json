Unfortunately for Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom, they are very famous, which is why the whole world has been keeping up with their Czech reunion in real time.\n\nThe couple, who broke up last February after dating for a year, are currently on vacation in Prague, where Bloom is shooting the Amazon series Carnival Row. They\u2019ve been photographed walking Bloom\u2019s dog, Mighty, as well as touring the city\u2019s castle. And for those wondering, it\u2019s too cold in Prague for any paddle boarding.\n\nThe trip is actually their second together this year. Bloom and Perry quietly met in the Maldives after Perry had wrapped her performance in Dubai, where fans photographed the couple attempting to lay low, Leonardo DiCaprio-style, in baseball caps.\n\nThere was also the Ed Sheeran concert last August, where fans caught the pair once again. They left the show together on Bloom\u2019s motorcycle.\n\nPerry addressed her relationship with Bloom on SiriusXM\u2019s Morning Mash Up that same month, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s nice to keep people you love around you. When you get older, lines get blurred.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69138dc2108d96082627c8f5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a395cd7c907581c4e97c58d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Year-in-Breakups-2017-SS01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690b9fc0ec5ef29213749182/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1310cbef65a723553b9a45/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/Katy-Perry-Convent-Battle.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a0f0275787cb12d25d3e7fa/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/katy-perry-victorias-secret-fashion-show.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68f78a9b09608217adbb6aae/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a395cd7c907581c4e97c58e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Year-in-Breakups-2017-SS03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a981b6c374b104fc4864312/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Bloom-Perry-Rekindle.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6900e724719651cf92568024/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a0b372f1a5224064956dd70/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/Perry-Calls-Out-Markle-Instagram.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690b869d6a6b7d01f3052591/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690cd8954962ddec3a078f19/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68f7a7dcc43cdce515acbc3f/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6916186f683a0692afe31876/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68ffa350ac05a478f30a0772/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a981b6c374b104fc4864312/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Bloom-Perry-Rekindle.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a395cd88ae8fd2b3a999c5b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Year-in-Breakups-2017-SS02.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a981b6c374b104fc4864312/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Bloom-Perry-Rekindle.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erika Harwood"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/katy-perry-and-orlando-bloom-rekindled-romance-prague", "title": "Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom Take Their Rekindled Romance to Prague", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Erika Harwood", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Not a single paddle board in sight.", "id": "5a981b301c6be356b8dcf86f", "keywords": "katy perry,orlando bloom,vanities", "news_keywords": "katy perry,orlando bloom,vanities", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a981b301c6be356b8dcf86f", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Not a single paddle board in sight.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a981b6c374b104fc4864312/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Bloom-Perry-Rekindle.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a981b6c374b104fc4864312/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Bloom-Perry-Rekindle.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Not a single paddle board in sight.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a981b6c374b104fc4864312/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Bloom-Perry-Rekindle.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom Take Their Rekindled Romance to Prague", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/katy-perry-and-orlando-bloom-rekindled-romance-prague"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-03-01T15:28:12.644Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-01T15:28:12.644Z", "author": "Erika Harwood"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Not a single paddle board in sight.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a981b6c374b104fc4864312/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Bloom-Perry-Rekindle.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom Take Their Rekindled Romance to Prague"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a981b6c374b104fc4864312/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/Bloom-Perry-Rekindle.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google": "nopagereadaloud", "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519918092.644, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
