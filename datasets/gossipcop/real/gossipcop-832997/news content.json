The season begins the day after the election. Character and additional plot details are being kept under wraps.\n\nHaynes, who is new to the franchise, joins fellow newbies to the anthology including Billie Lourd and Billy Eichner. Returning castmembers include Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters.\n\nThis marks Haynes\u2019 second collaboration with Murphy. He also appeared in a few episodes of Fox\u2019s Scream Queens.\n\nHaynes is repped by UTA and Ziffren Brittenham.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/colton_haynes_headshot_p_2016.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/colton_haynes_headshot_p_2016.jpg?w=2000&h=1126&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/colton_haynes_headshot_p_2016.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Goldberg", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/american-horror-story-enlists-colton-haynes-season-7-1015446/", "title": "\u2018American Horror Story\u2019 Enlists Colton Haynes for Season 7", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The 'Arrow' and 'Teen Wolf' grad joins a cast that also includes Billie Lourd.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Lesley Goldberg", "tags": "American Horror Story, Colton Haynes", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018American Horror Story\u2019 Enlists Colton Haynes for Season 7", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/american-horror-story-enlists-colton-haynes-season-7-1015446/", "description": "The 'Arrow' and 'Teen Wolf' grad joins a cast that also includes Billie Lourd.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/colton_haynes_headshot_p_2016.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "'American Horror Story' Enlists Colton Haynes Season 7"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-20T17:34:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-29T06:17:05+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 'Arrow' and 'Teen Wolf' grad joins a cast that also includes Billie Lourd.", "site": "@thr", "creator": "@snoodit", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018American Horror Story\u2019 Enlists Colton Haynes for Season 7", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/colton_haynes_headshot_p_2016.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497980080.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
