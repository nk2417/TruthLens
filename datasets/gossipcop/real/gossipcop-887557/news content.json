Well, Vivianne has. Vivianne was a little disappointed at first because she wanted a baby sister, but she got over that within 10 minutes and now she\u2019s so excited and kisses my belly every day.\u201d\n\nNever miss a parenting story with the TODAY Parenting newsletter!

Jordan Strauss / AP\n\nAfter welcoming Bubby in 2015, Decker shared an honest photo of her post-baby body to encourage other moms not to be too hard on themselves \u2014 and she maintains that positive outlook.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever felt pressure to look a certain way,\u201d she said. \u201cI always just go by what makes me feel good. And so as soon as I have my kids, I really just focus on breastfeeding and spending time with them and not thinking about getting my body back. It\u2019s impossible \u2014 all my time is spent taking care of an infant. I don\u2019t know how women do that \u2014 more power to them, but I would rather spend all that time taking care of them. Once I\u2019m done breastfeeding, that\u2019s when I get that ammunition to be like \u2018OK, let\u2019s get healthy again. Let\u2019s start working out and tone up this booty again.\u2019 And it makes you feel good, but for the most part, I don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\nDecker isn\u2019t shy about sharing sweet family moments with her 2.7 million Instagram followers. And while internet trolls can be quick to criticize celebrity moms on the social-media platform, Decker says she\u2019s actually gained a few valuable tips from commenters.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ve been things that fans have pointed out on Instagram that, for the most part, I was actually grateful for,\u201d she said. \u201cSomeone suggested cutting up grapes and not giving to them whole, because it\u2019s such a choking hazard. It seems so obvious. It\u2019s just something I didn\u2019t think of and I now cut the grapes up thanks to them. And then someone pointed out that I was wearing a front carrier incorrectly, and I didn\u2019t realize that I was.\u201d\n\nDecker, who\u2019s due in March, says this pregnancy has been easier than her first, but not quite as smooth as her second.\n\n\u201cVivianne was the most difficult pregnancy of all time,\u201d she said. \u201cShe tried to kill me. Bubby was fairly easy. This one\u2019s kind of in the middle. With Bubby, I had morning sickness for a week and then was done. With this one, I had it for eight weeks and then I threw up this morning.\u201d\n\nWhile nausea is her least favorite part of being pregnant, she\u2019s also cherishing this time.\n\n\u201cI love being pregnant because there\u2019s just something special about being a woman and being able to grow a baby in your body,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s just nothing like it. I love knowing that there\u2019s somebody in me that I\u2019m nurturing and taking care of; it\u2019s such a special bond.\u201d\n\nDecker has a busy schedule with her music career, reality show and her own fashion line, Kittenish. She does experience mom guilt \u2014 and that\u2019s OK.\n\n\u201cI think everyone puts pressure on themselves in one way or another,\u201d she said. \u201cI always feel guilty when I leave to go work. I don\u2019t leave that often and if I do, I\u2019m not gone more than 48 hours and my mom watches them, so the kids don\u2019t even think they\u2019re being babysat. But it\u2019s pressure and it\u2019s guilt and we all have it. But I always say, if you feel guilty and get that anxiety, that means you\u2019re a good mom. Cause if you didn\u2019t, that means you didn\u2019t care. So think if you feel that guilt, pat yourself on the back. You\u2019re a good mom because you obviously care enough to be worried about it.\"", "images":
