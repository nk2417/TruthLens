Maybe it's my extremely analytical Virgo moon talking, but the urge to overthink and, essentially, panic whenever a plan veers slightly off course is all too real. It's only when I vent to my sister that she points out how the circumstances aren't as dire as they seem \u2014 or that they've actually shifted in a way that's beneficial to me. The Leo slogan is \"I will\" for a reason. Their priority is to progress, to prove themselves, and to ultimately secure their reputation as royalty among the Zodiac. They aren't exactly the most adaptable sign, but they know how to work just about any situation to their advantage \u2014 and the first step toward profiting off of a hiccup is usually to freak out as little as possible.", "images": ["https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d68e2ddc49f6065953daf57eac5b849a.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/b3658fb2d9482c50df8996241fb2b67d.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/9aa89696be7da8b249e2ee2622a111e9.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/1ce585852b9e9a8cba36762b911e0f5f.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/cda4774d79df76d9c5ab2dfba3784155.png", "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/0e7/0,213,3000,1575/x,80/1935087/image.jpg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/90e3b0501ff143bd058ecb3f754a4430.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/c5a8ae3dd50e6ebe17044593c2c7ee0c.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/6a9d712b4b1480df334054a94146cc34.png"], "top_img": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/0e7/0,213,3000,1575/x,80/1935087/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Doss\u00e9-Via Trenou", "Lisa Stardust", "Leo Woman Traits", "Lessons Learned Zodiac Sign"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/leo-woman-national-sisters-day-astrology", "title": "4 Lessons I Learned From My Leo Sister", "meta_data": {"title": "Leo Woman Traits & Lessons Learned From Zodiac Sign", "description": "There's a reason why we aren't all Leos, but the rest of us could stand to learn something from their passionate, expansive approach to life.", "og": {"url": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/leo-woman-national-sisters-day-astrology", "title": "4 Lessons I Learned From My Leo Sister", "description": "There's a reason why we aren't all Leos, but the rest of us could stand to learn something from their passionate, expansive approach to life.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/0e7/0,213,3000,1575/x,80/1935087/image.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/0e7/0,213,3000,1575/x,80/1935087/image.jpg", "width": 3000, "height": 1575}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "4 Lessons I Learned From My Leo Sister", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@refinery29uk", "description": "There's a reason why we aren't all Leos, but the rest of us could stand to learn something from their passionate, expansive approach to life.", "image": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/0e7/0,213,3000,1575/x,80/1935087/image.jpg"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/0e7/760,0,1480,2000/x,80/1935087/image.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 155023867867753, "pages": "86973707921,587074007996399,269626263209765,509115739117952,1562713254009921,583745561686633,656112191237463,284423314989162,974273182666651,192477361634120"}, "article": {"publisher": "refinery29uk"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#fd5b4e", "p": {"domain_verify": "824df583bae44d08b2de179a271364fd"}, "entry_template": "entry.slideshow", "author": "Sara Coughlin"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.refinery29.com", "summary": ""}
