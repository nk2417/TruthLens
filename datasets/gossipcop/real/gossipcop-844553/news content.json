I\u2019ve only just recently come out as bisexual to my friends and family,\u201d she said in a photo posted to Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s something I am still processing and trying to understand and I don\u2019t like talking about it too much.\u201d\n\nThe tweet was seemingly prompted by previous tweets from upset Riverdale fans about the use of queerbaiting in the teen drama in which the actress also stars. LGBT viewers were hopeful that the two female leads, Betty and Veronica, would be an item thanks to a kiss shared early on in the series. But when nothing came to be, some criticized the show's use of girl-on-girl action for views.\n\nOne twitter user, by the name of \u201cjamie not spears,\u201d tweeted \u201cberonica fans are frustrated because they were blatantly, undeniably queerbaited into watching the show.\u201d\n\nPurser retweeted the user\u2019s thread, responding, \u201cAnd I get that, representation is so powerful and important. But we didn't write the show? We have literally no say in what happens.\u201d\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nIn Purser\u2019s coming out tweet, she mentions her previous comments towards the queerbaiting backlash and apologized for what seems to be a tweet directed towards the fans who strongly shipped the two female characters.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very very new to the LGBT community,\u201d she wrote in the tweet. \u201cI have never heard the term \u2018queerbaiting\u2019 in my life until today. That being said, I have never ever wanted to alienate anyone and my tweet was thoughtless. I wasn't referring to all the beronica shippers, just the ones who had been particularly cruel to me personally.\"\n\nAlthough this was the first explicit statement about her sexual orientation, the star hasn\u2019t been shy about the topic of sexuality in the past.\n\nEarlier this month, she took to Twitter to talk about the anxiety she experienced over her sexuality.\n\nAre \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019 and \u2018Power Rangers\u2019 queerbaiting LGBT fans?", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/ca39855c2e593960e339f0491264cc7572e68312/c=0-93-1992-1219/local/-/media/2017/04/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/636275832103803431-663602100.jpg?width=1992&height=1126&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gciaf/prod/p?a=pageview&p=USAT-TEALIUM-TANGENT&m=web&k=f14ebdd6-0569-4c64-af73-99937bc06379&s=noscript", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/ca39855c2e593960e339f0491264cc7572e68312/c=0-93-1992-1219/local/-/media/2017/04/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/636275832103803431-663602100.jpg?width=660&height=374&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/ca39855c2e593960e339f0491264cc7572e68312/c=0-93-1992-1219/local/-/media/2017/04/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/636275832103803431-663602100.jpg?width=1992&height=1126&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/04/19/stranger-things-star-shannon-purser-comes-out-bi-addresses-queerbaiting/100660870/", "title": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 star Shannon Purser comes out as bi, addresses queerbaiting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 star Shannon Purser comes out as bi, addresses queerbaiting", "description": "Shannon Purser, known for her role as Barb, has come out as bisexual on Twitter.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/04/19/stranger-things-star-shannon-purser-comes-out-bi-addresses-queerbaiting/100660870/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/ca39855c2e593960e339f0491264cc7572e68312/c=0-93-1992-1219/local/-/media/2017/04/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/636275832103803431-663602100.jpg?width=1992&height=1126&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1992, "height": 1126}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Sara M Moniuszko", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Shannon Purser, known for her role as Barb, has come out as bisexual on Twitter.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 1279862243338849}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/ca39855c2e593960e339f0491264cc7572e68312/c=0-93-1992-1219/local/-/media/2017/04/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/636275832103803431-663602100.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 star Shannon Purser comes out as bi, addresses queerbaiting", "description": "Shannon Purser, known for her role as Barb, has come out as bisexual on Twitter."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492574400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
