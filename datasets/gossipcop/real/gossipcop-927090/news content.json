Good Morning America on Wednesday revealed the full cast line-up for Season 27, which includes Harry Potter's Evanna Lynch (aka Luna Lovegood), Fuller House's Juan Pablo Di Pace and The Dukes of Hazzard's John Schneider.\n\nAlso competing this fall are comedian Nikki Glaser, radio personality-turned-American Idol mentor Bobby Bones, singer Tinashe and Instagram model Alexis Ren. Among the athletes taking part are Olympic gymnast Mary Lou Retton, Paralympian Danelle Umstead and Super Bowl champ DeMarcus Ware.\n\nAll of the above join previous confirmed contestants, including Facts of Life vet Nancy McKeon, Disney Channel star Milo \"Son of Camryn\" Manheim and Bachelorette Season 14 alum Joe Amabile, whose casting was first revealed during Tuesday's Bachelor in Paradise finale.\n\n[pmc_inline_gallery]\n\nMcKeon marks the third Facts of Life vet to participate in the ABC reality competition, following Kim Fields (who finished seventh in Season 22) and Cloris Leachman (who finished seventh in Season 7).
