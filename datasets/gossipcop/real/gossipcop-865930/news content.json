Who wouldn\u2019t be upset at being written off one of the most popular shows on TV? Back in Season 5, actor Ian McElhinney was vocally annoyed when his character, Ser Barristan Selmy, was killed off long before the book version kicked the bucket. Now it\u2019s a Dornishman\u2019s turn. Actor Alexander Siddig\u2014beloved by many for his years on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\u2014abruptly met his end at the start of Season 6. But, according to Sidding, that wasn\u2019t always the plan.\n\nSpeaking with StarTrek.com, Siddig admitted that originally being cast on the show as Prince Doran Martell was a thrill to him. \u201cIt was such a huge thing, and there was so much publicity money,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s what I remember, everything was so huge. And actors praying they weren\u2019t going to be killed.\u201d\n\nBut no amount of praying could save Siddig from Season 6, Episode 1, in which his character took a dagger to the chest and bled out on the exquisite flagstones of Dorne. The abrupt murder\u2014accompanied by the even swifter deaths of Areoh Hotah and Prince Trystane\u2014came as a shock to viewers but, perhaps, not an unpleasant one. That triple homicide essentially cut Dorne out of the Season 6 plot, and, given how unpopular that location was the year before, that may have been the point.", "images":
