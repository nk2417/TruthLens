We keep going back to \u2018Take it one day at a time.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

But they\u2019re already a little wiser since bringing Willa home.\n\n\u201cGoing back and forth to Uganda, being a parent to Willa over there, I felt like I learned how resilient children are,\u201d says Thomas Rhett, who posed for this week\u2019s PEOPLE issue in an at-home photo spread with his family, captured by photographer Julie Paisley.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Two Under 2! Thomas Rhett and Wife Lauren on Welcoming Daughters Within Three Months: \u201cThere\u2019s Never a Dull Moment!\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore I had children, I felt like any baby I held, I was holding glass,\u201d Thomas Rhett adds. \u201cBut now I know if they lean down and grab an Oreo off the ground, they\u2019re not going to die.\u201d\n\nEmbracing that notion made taking Willa on the road a lot easier, he says. \u201cAt first I was like, if we bring a baby on the bus, how is she going to sleep? There are bumps on the road. What is she going to eat out there? What if there\u2019s only Subway? But Willa just goes with the flow. There isn\u2019t much about our lifestyle we changed.\u201d\n\nJulie Paisley Photography\n\nWatch the full episode of PEOPLE Features: Thomas Rhett \u2013 Meet My Baby Girls, available now on the PEOPLE/Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN). Go to people.com/PEN or download the PEN app on your favorite mobile or connected TV device.\n\nSince coming to America, Willa has already hit the concert stage, seen Times Square and stolen the spotlight from Dad on the morning shows, all \u201cwithout skipping a beat!\u201d Lauren says.\n\nBut with baby No. 2, life gets a little more complicated. \u201cWhen Ada falls asleep. Willa wakes up from her nap, and the moment that Willa falls asleep for her nap, Ada screams,\u201d Thomas Rhett explains.\n\n\u201cSo the only peace that me and Lauren get is when we get in bed at 9 \u2014 and we pass out by 9:30,\u201d he admits. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging to make sure me and Lauren still spend that intentional time with each other to breathe for a second.\u201d\n\nTime with Lauren, after all, has inspired several of Thomas Rhett\u2019s biggest hits, including \u201cDie a Happy Man.\u201d His latest album is already influenced by his newest well of inspiration: his two girls.\n\nOn the title track (co-written with his dad Rhett Akins along with Ashley Gorley and Jesse Frasure), the singer chronicles the family\u2019s unusual journey to becoming a foursome:\n\nI remember the day I told my daddy and mama\n\nYou\u2019re gonna have a grandkid from Uganda\n\nThat\u2019s right, we\u2019re adoptin\u2019\n\nAnd she is the cutest little girl that you ever seen\n\nWhile I was wrappin\u2019 my head around bein\u2019 a dad\n\nA big wrench got thrown in the plans we thought we had\n\nNow Lauren\u2019s showin\u2019, got one on the way\n\nYeah, that\u2019s two under two, hey, what can I say\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just partial to that song because there\u2019s no one else that can sing it,\u201d says Thomas Rhett, adding that it barely made it onto the album \u2014 which was far along by the time the song was written.\n\nJulie Paisley Photography\n\nFROM PEN: Former Bachelorette Ashley HEbert Rosenbaum Opens Up About Her Sibling Rivalry Fears\n\n\n\nBut the singer \u2014 who has yet another role as a judge at the 2018 Miss America Competition Sept. 10, alongside Jordin Sparks, Molly Sims and PEOPLE Editor-in-Chief Jess Cagle \u2014 promises more tunes inspired by becoming a dad.\n\n\u201cThe girls will be in my songs 100 percent. If you look at my phone, every single song title is either about my children or has been inspired by something they have done or said,\u201d Thomas Rhett says.\n\nJulie Paisley Photography\n\nRELATED GALLERY: The Fab Four! A Peek Inside Thomas Rhett and Lauren Akins\u2019 Family Life\n\n\u201cThis record was pretty much closed out by the time our whole family was here, so I\u2019m probably going to need to release a side project and tell people, \u2018Life Changes is my real record, but if you want to get real sappy and cry, you can listen to this!\u2019 \u201d\n\nFor more on Thomas Rhett and Lauren Akins\u2019
