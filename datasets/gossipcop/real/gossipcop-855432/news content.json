Producers banked Sunday night\u2019s performance, originally described in media reports as a rehearsal, during the live telecast.\n\nThe Kats! Bureau at this writing is the Billboard Music Awards show at T-Mobile Arena. The Vegas Golden Knights open play here in October, but the music industry\u2019s Vegas golden night was Sunday.\n\nSee how I did that?\n\nFrom the scene:\n\nDrake\u2019s explosive performance of \u201cGyalchester\u201d at Bellagio Fountains was presented as \u201clive.\u201d It wasn\u2019t. Producers banked Saturday night\u2019s performance, originally described in media reports as a rehearsal, and aired it during the live telecast.\n\nNonetheless, the event was one of the splashiest (pun intended) staged performances ever on Lake Bellagio.\n\nThe list of such shows is impressive. Last year Pitbull, Joe Perry of Aerosmith, Travis Barker of Blink-182 and Robin Thicke (of \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d fame) and a half-dozen dancers performed a commercial for TNT that aired during the NBA playoffs. Bruno Mars cut across the lake on a Jet-Ski in his \u201c24K Magic video, Imagine Dragons performed a \u201cpop up\u201d show in 2014, an acoustic run-through of \u201cIt\u2019s Time,\u201d \u201cBet My Life\u201d and \u201cRadioactive.\u201d And, lest we forget, Britney Spears performed \u201cI\u2019m A Slave 4 U\u201d at the fountains to open the 2001 BMAs.\n\nThese events, constructed as promotional partnerships with the artists and producers, indicate the value of the Bellagio Fountains. It costs nothing to view the attraction from the Strip or the hotel (or from competing properties, for that matter). Construction cost between $40 - $75 million, with a monthly operating cost reportedly between $300,000 to $400,000. But hotel officials agree that, in terms of marketing value, the fountains paid for themselves long ago.\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nStreep cred\n\nApplause line from co-host Vanessa Hudgens, saying of Celine Dion: \u201cShe is the Meryl Streep of music.\u201d\n\nDion later leveled the place with \u201cMy Heart Will Go On,\u201d calling out the song from inside a tall, crystal chandelier, seemingly in tears at the chilling conclusion as the sold-out crowd of 10,400 erupted. As the show\u2019s other co-host, Ludacris, said, \u201cThat was a moment! Give it up for Celine Dion.\u201d\n\nAnd how a superstar closes a song ... give it up for this woman @celinedion @BBMAs @tmobilearena pic.twitter.com/oO8vbpz6nW \u2014 John Katsilometes (@johnnykats) May 22, 2017\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nElvis in the mix\n\nThe city of Las Vegas\u2019 go-to Elvis impressionist, Jesse Garon, co-starred in the new video Top Country Artist nominee Florida Georgia Line filmed around VegasVille last week. The new single is \u201cSmooth,\u201d and Garon-as-Elvis swept through downtown Las Vegas, Bonnie Springs, Golden Nugget and the Little White Wedding Chapel.\n\nGaron has also become the Elvis of record for FGL\u2019s Brian Kelley and Tyler Hubbard, who rode in the back seat of Garon\u2019s 1955 Cadillac Series 62 convertible when arriving at the Academy of Country Music Awards in April. Craig Wiseman, who owns the Big Loud Shirt record label and reps FGL, connected the country duo with Garon.\n\nCyrus goes boom\n\nMiley Cyrus debuted her song, \u201cMalibu,\u201d with a beautiful beach scene in the backdrop, and similarly beautiful cascade of balloons from the T-Mobile rafters.\n\nAn explosion of sound soon followed, as workers scrambled to pop the balloons \u2014 using long pins in both hands \u2014 during a commercial break. An announcer bellowed the crowd, \u201cPlease! Help us pop these balloons!\u201d Hundreds of spent balloons littered the floor for much of the telecast.\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nStefani-Cher moment\n\nGwen Stefani introduced Cher, who accepted the Icon Award with full-production performances of \u201cBelieve\u201d and \u201cIf I Could Turn Back Time.\u201d\n\nStefani has evidently recovered from the burst eardrum she suffered April 27, which knocked her out of the annual Keep Memory Alive Power of Love gala. Of Cher, she said, \u201cShe is a woman who doesn\u2019t know the meaning of \u2018It can\u2019t be done.\u2019\u201d The Park Theater headliner turned 71 Saturday. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing what I want to do since I was 4 years old \u2026 My mom told me I might not be the prettiest, I might not be the most talented, but I would be something special.\u201d\n\nJohn Katsilometes\u2019 column runs daily in the A section.
