She took a 14-foot leap off a balcony for that foot chase with the Waif in Season 6. So it wasn\u2019t a complete stretch to imagine she might have been able to pull this move off. But Williams has also always been very generous about her stunt doubles, reserving specific praise for the woman who was hired on last year whom she called \u201cfit\u201d a \u201ctrooper\u201d and \u201cincredible.\u201d Though that wasn\u2019t always the case: \u201cI\u2019ve had stunt doubles before where\u2014they were lovely girls\u2014but they didn\u2019t look like me,\u201d she told TVLine in 2016. \u201cI didn\u2019t buy it. Like, I don\u2019t look at you from behind and think that you look like me. And that means the audience is gonna be the same. They\u2019re gonna be like, \u2018That\u2019s not Arya!\u2019 And instead of watching a fight scene like, \u2018Oh my gosh girl, get up! Get up!,\u2019 you\u2019re going to be going, \u2018That wasn\u2019t even Maisie!\u2019\u201d\n\nWilliams doesn\u2019t name her double in that or any other interview, nor is it easy to find her name online. Williams was also disinclined to point out specifically which moves, other than that balcony leap, she executed herself in Season 6. This is likely all part of Thrones wanting to keep the mystery alive. But now that they\u2019ve pulled back the curtain on who did what in this particular fight, it\u2019s worth praising Williams (and Christie) for one very specific piece of fancy foot and hand work. The final grapple, which includes a lightning-quick flip of the dagger for Arya, appears to have been all them.", "images":
