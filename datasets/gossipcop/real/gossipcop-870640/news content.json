Andy Grammer\u2019s Wife Describes Her Husband\u2019s Emotional Reaction: \u201cI Ordered Tiny Hangers and [Andy] Just Cried\u201d\n\nThe spouses confirmed their baby news exclusively to PEOPLE in March, with Aijia saying, \u201cIt\u2019s been really exciting because on both sides of our family it\u2019s the first girl, so it\u2019s fun because it\u2019s happy news to everyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like if you told me I would be having a son, I would be like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m gonna be a parent \u2014 I get that,\u2019 \u201d Grammer added. \u201cBut when the doctor was like, \u2018You\u2019re gonna have a girl,\u2019 I was like, \u2018What? Who am I?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the craziest piece of information that changes who you are,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s sweet.\u201d\n\nOf the pair\u2019s decision to start their family, Aijia told PEOPLE, \u201cEverybody is always telling you that you have to hurry because you\u2019re running out of time. So there\u2019s these two different mentalities of, \u2018You\u2019re getting older, it\u2019s not gonna work forever,\u2019 and then, \u2018You should just focus on your career because that\u2019s the priority.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI think for both of us, I got to a point where I was like, \u2018You know, one of them is not more important than the other,\u2019 \u201d she added. \u201cWe want to have a family and there\u2019s no doubt that that\u2019s what we wanted.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Inside Sean \u201cPuff Daddy\u201d Combs\u2019 Life At Home with Six Kids: \u201cI\u2019m the Luckiest Man in the World\u201d\n\nThe \u201cHoney, I\u2019m Good\u201d crooner\u2019s baby girl has a very special middle name: It\u2019s a nod to the new dad\u2018s own late mother Kathy, who died eight years ago.\n\n\u201cWhen I talk about my mother, the only thing that makes me super emotional is that I had such a sweet bond with my mother, and even when I try to talk about this little new lady that\u2019s coming into our lives I get a little emotional, too,\u201d Grammer said in March.\n\n\u201cI take the role of being a father to a daughter very seriously,\u201d he added. \u201cI think there\u2019s something very special about that \u2014 there\u2019s a lot about women\u2019s empowerment right now; I think the coolest thing you can do is just raise a really strong daughter.\u201d",
