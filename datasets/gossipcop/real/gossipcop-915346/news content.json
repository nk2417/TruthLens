In addition to a quest to restore magic, exploring a character\u2019s posthumous escapades, and depicting silent scenes as characters communicate exclusively in American Sign Language, the Syfy series is embarking upon a musical episode.\n\nThe idea came from executive producer John McNamara. After seeing the one-time performance of \u201cOne Day More\u201d take off with audiences in the second season, he wanted to go all in.\n\n\u201cRight around the time we realized the \u2018Les Miserables\u2019 number last year was going to work, John was like, \u2018So next season I have this idea for how to do an episode where all of the talking is singing,'\u201d executive producer Sera Gamble tells Variety.\n\nAlthough slightly less enthusiastic about the idea at first, Gamble came around. \u201cThis episode really represents me talking him just a step or two back from that ledge,\u201d she continues.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAsking their cast to break into song has been part of Gamble and McNamara\u2019s \u201cThe Magicians\u201d tasks since the beginning. The first season featured a scene where Quentin (Jason Ralph) performed a quick rendition of Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cShake It Off.\u201d The second season\u2019s attempt got a little more ambitious with the \u201cLes Mis\u201d moment. But season 3\u2019s \u201cAll That Josh,\u201d which airs Mar. 7, is the show\u2019s biggest undertaking yet \u2014featuring multiple songs in the 42-minute episode.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t really want this to be easy,\u201d Gamble says. \u201cWe want to challenge ourselves and never, ever, take for granted that people are going to be interested in the show. We want to continue to woo you and promise you weird, ambitious, crazy things. This represented our philosophy about creating the show.\u201d\n\nGamble and McNamara say they were confident about going bigger with the production value of the musical numbers in \u201cAll That Josh.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe orchestrations were much more complicated, the staging was much more complicated, and [it] required a lot of rehearsal,\u201d McNamara says.\n\nThey also asked actors who had never sung on the show before to be a part of those numbers. \u201cThank god the actors were game!\u201d McNamara says. \u201cThey were nervous, and wanted to be good, but no one balked.\u201d\n\nOne of those actors was Trevor Einhorn, who plays Josh. In the episode, Quentin, Kady (Jade Tailor), and Alice (Olivia Taylor Dudley) find Josh in a dimension stuck in a party loop. As long as the good times roll, everything is great, but the second anyone starts to question the party, things turn ugly. Einhorn was asked a lot from the episode \u2014 not just because he was central to the plot, but also because he was one of the few cast members with previous musical experience.\n\n\u201cI took it one step at a time,\u201d Einhorn says. \u201cI read it and thought, \u2018Cool we\u2019re doing multiple songs. And then it was, \u2018Cool, I\u2019m singing three out of the four songs. That\u2019s a big undertaking.\u2019 So, I was a little nervous but mostly just excited. When you see your name in the title as an actor you\u2019re just happy it didn\u2019t say \u2018Josh Dies \u2013 Part 1.'\u201d\n\nIn Lev Grossman\u2019s book series from which the show is inspired, Josh is one of the central and fan favorite characters. As happens when books are adapted for TV and movies, things tend to be tweaked and moved around. However, Einhorn hopes the audience will be \u201cpleasantly surprised to know that he\u2019s not just back, but that he\u2019s back in a big way\u201d after this pivotal episode.\n\nWhether the show will continue its trend of upping the musical stakes every year is too early for producers to say, but despite being skeptical about musicals at first, Gamble now shares that having them pop up in the show represents something key for \u201cThe Magicians.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the themes of our show is that, ultimately you\u2019ll do just a little bit better in your life if you admit to yourself what you love and you embrace it no matter how deeply nerdy, or embarrassing, or niche, or weird,\u201d she says.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nup_180356_1166.jpg?w=1000&h=667&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nup_180356_1166.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nup_180356_1166.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacob Bryant", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/the-magicians-musical-all-that-josh-trevor-einhorn-sera-gamble-john-mcnamara-interview-1202720783/", "title": "How \u2018The Magicians\u2019 Musical Episode Came to Be", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The team behind \"The Magicians\" break down how they put together a musical episode for the third season of the Syfy series.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Jacob Bryant", "tags": "John McNamara, Sera Gamble, The Magicians", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "How \u2018The Magicians\u2019 Musical Episode Came to Be", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/the-magicians-musical-all-that-josh-trevor-einhorn-sera-gamble-john-mcnamara-interview-1202720783/", "description": "The team behind \"The Magicians\" break down how they put together a musical episode for the third season of the Syfy series.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nup_180356_1166.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "THE MAGICIANS -- \"All That Josh\" Episode 309 -- Pictured: (l-r) -- (Photo by: Eric Milner/Syfy)"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-07T20:03:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-07T20:05:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The team behind \"The Magicians\" break down how they put together a musical episode for the third season of the Syfy series.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@Jacobb41", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How \u2018The Magicians\u2019 Musical Episode Came to Be", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nup_180356_1166.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520453036.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
