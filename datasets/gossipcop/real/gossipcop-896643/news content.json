The Dan Reynolds-fronted group woke up to news that their third studio effort is up for best pop vocal album alongside efforts from Coldplay, Lana Del Rey, Kesha and Ed Sheeran.\n\nExplore Imagine Dragons See latest videos, charts and news\n\nTheir No. 3 Billboard Hot 100 hit \u201cThunder\u201d landed in the best pop duo/group performance category in competition with The Chainsmokers and Coldplay\u2019s \u201cSomething Just Like This,\u201d Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee\u2019s \u201cDespacito,\u201d Portugal.
