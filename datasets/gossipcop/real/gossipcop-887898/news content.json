Lawrence said that, early on in her career, she had been instructed to lose \u201c15 pounds in two weeks\u201d\u2014a practically impossible and definitely unhealthy feat\u2014to get (and keep) a part. \u201cDuring this time, a female producer had me do a nude lineup with about five women who were much, much, thinner than me,\u201d she said. \u201cWe stood side by side with only paste-ons covering our privates.\u201d\n\nWhen Lawrence went to another producer to complain, \u201che said he didn\u2019t know why everyone thought I was so fat. He thought I was \u2018perfectly fuckable,\u2019\u201d she added. The whole experience left her feeling \u201ctrapped\u201d and afraid of being labeled \u201cdifficult\u201d if she stood up for herself. \u201cI let myself be treated a certain way because I felt I had to for my career,\u201d she said.\n\nMolly Ringwald\n\nIn an op-ed posted on The New Yorker website this afternoon, Molly Ringwald says that, while she was able to avoid harassment in her dealings with Harvey Weinstein (\u201cat that moment in time, I was the one with more power,\u201d she writes), \u201cI have had plenty of Harveys of my own over the years, enough to feel a sickening shock of recognition.\u201d She says:\n\nWhen I was thirteen, a fifty-year-old crew member told me that he would teach me to dance, and then proceeded to push against me with an erection. At fourteen, a married film director stuck his tongue in my mouth on set. At a time when I was trying to figure out what it meant to become a sexually viable young woman, at every turn some older guy tried to help speed up the process.\n\nShe goes on to recall a humiliating audition where she was forced to wear a dog collar for reasons that had nothing to do with the scene, an incident her agent dismissed as \u201cone for the memoirs.\u201d \u201cStories like these have never been taken seriously. Women are shamed, told they are uptight, nasty, bitter, can\u2019t take a joke, are too sensitive,\u201d Ringwald writes. \u201cAnd the men? Well, if they\u2019re lucky, they might get elected President.\u201d\n\nLady Gaga\n\nLady Gaga first publicly revealed her rape at the hands of a record producer back in 2014, when she said on The Howard Stern Show that her song \u201cSwine\u201d was about being assaulted when she was 19 years old and \u201cvery na\u00efve.\u201d Gaga later performed a powerful rendition of her song \u201cTil It Happens To You,\u201d from the campus rape documentary The Hunting Ground, at the 2016 Oscars, surrounded by fellow survivors.\n\nGabrielle Union\n\nGabrielle Union has also been open about her experience as an assault survivor for many years. This morning, she appeared on Good Morning America to promote her new book, We\u2019re Gonna Need More Wine, in which she discusses being raped at gunpoint at the age of 19, among other issues. On the show, she described the powerful post-traumatic stress she experienced upon seeing the hashtag trending:\n\nI saw #MeToo and my arm went numb. I thought it was all about me, and when I realized literally hundreds of thousands of people, men and women, talking about being a part of this unfortunate club. It just rips your heart out. I will continue talking about it, I will continue to try to keep educating. You see so much now with victim blaming and victim shaming and really trying to put the onus on the victim and trying to say that there\u2019s some right way to deal with trauma. And I just have to keep speaking out to dispel as many misconceptions as possible about sexual violence.\n\nEvan Rachel Wood\n\nAnother outspoken survivor, Evan Rachel Wood has talked about having been sexually assaulted twice, once by an ex and again by the owner of a bar. Last year, she posted a lengthy statement on Twitter talking about the assaults after touching on them in a Rolling Stone interview, and she has continued to advocate for victims\u2019 rights ever since.\n\nMore recently, she posted a video explaining why she has yet to name her attackers; it\u2019s \u201cnot because I don\u2019t plan on saying these people\u2019s names eventually, but because to start that process is an emotionally draining, financially draining, really everything draining thing to do and to go through and I want to do it when I\u2019m ready,\u201d she said. Over the weekend on Twitter, Wood talked about her experiences with PTSD after being raped, and how she would disassociate to protect herself. You can read those comments in full here.\n\nMelanie Lynskey\n\nActress Melanie Lynskey has been an outspoken supporter of the women who came forward to accuse Weinstein, and added her voice in a thread responding to a New York Times editorial by Big Bang Theory star Mayim Bialik, in which Bialik credited her modest dress and inability to conform to an \u201cimpossible standard of beauty\u201d for her lack of experience with sexual harassment on set.\n\nBj\u00f6rk\n\nInspired by the accounts that were already coming out before the #MeToo hashtag took off, on Sunday Bj\u00f6rk told the story of her encounters with \u201ca Danish film director\u201d who repeatedly came on to her on set and humiliated and punished her when she turned him down. \u201cIt was extremely clear to me when I walked into the actresses\u2019 profession that my humiliation and role as a lesser, sexually harassed being was the norm,\u201d she wrote. Although she didn\u2019t mention him by name, Bj\u00f6rk only made one movie with a Danish director, Dancer In The Dark with Lars Von Trier, prompting Von Trier to deny her account the next day. Today Bj\u00f6rk shot back with more detailed allegations:\n\nPatricia Arquette\n\nAfter director Oliver Stone expressed sympathy for Harvey Weinstein, Patricia Arquette suggested that this was a case of creeps protecting their own by detailing her \u201cweird\u201d experience with Stone after he asked to meet with her about a film that was \u201cvery sexual\u201d in content. She\u2019s now calling for an end to the backlog of hundreds of thousands of rape kits that are sitting untested at law-enforcement agencies around the world.\n\nIsa Dick Hackett\n\nHackett, a producer on Amazon\u2019s The Man In The High Castle and Philip K. Dick\u2019s Electric Dreams\u2014both based on the work of her father, sci-fi author Philip K. Dick\u2014gave an interview to The Hollywood Reporter last Thursday in which she accused then-Amazon programming chief Roy Price of sexual harassment. Price, she said, repeatedly and aggressively sexually propositioned her even after she turned him down, going so far as to tell her, \u201cYou will love my dick.\u201d Price has since resigned from Amazon Studios.\n\nHilarie Burton\n\nA former MTV VJ turned actress (she starred on One Tree Hill and currently appears on Fox\u2019s Lethal Weapon reboot), Hilarie Burton accused Ben Affleck of grabbing her breast during an appearance on Total Request Live in 2003, prompting other women, like makeup artist Annamarie Tendler, to also accuse Affleck of improper conduct toward them. Affleck later apologized to Burton, in a one-line tweet that didn\u2019t even have proper punctuation at the end.\n\nTerry Crews\n\nIn the wake of the Weinstein accusations, Terry Crews came forward to share his story of being groped by an unnamed Hollywood executive in front of his wife at a party, and the shame and fear he felt that prevented him from speaking about it earlier. \u201cHopefully, me coming forward with my story will deter a predator and encourage someone who feels hopeless,\u201d he wrote. It\u2019s a powerful reminder that sexual assault can happen to anyone. Click through on the tweet below to read the full thread.\n\nJames Van Der Beek\n\nShortly after Crews came forward, former child star James Van Der Beek talked about his experiences being assaulted by \u201colder, powerful men\u201d as well.\n\nJavier Mu\u00f1oz\n\nMu\u00f1oz stars as Alexander Hamilton in the Broadway production of Hamilton. He took over the role from Lin-Manuel Miranda last year.\n\nJenny Slate\n\nRosario Dawson\n\nAnna Paquin\n\nAnika Noni Rose\n\nDebra Messing\n\nFelicia Day\n\nKimya Dawson\n\nThese are just a few of those shared in recent days by famous people who were able to talk about what happened to them in public. Just because someone hasn\u2019t posted \u201cMe too\u201d doesn\u2019t meant that they haven\u2019t lived through harassment and assault; they may not be emotionally prepared to talk about their experiences publicly, and re-traumatize themselves in the process. The important thing is to remember that these stories are difficult to tell, and should be believed.\n\nUpdated October 18, 9:09 a.m.:\n\nIlana Glazer\n\nBroad City co-creator Ilana Glazer\u2019s Instagram post about the \u201ccountless\u201d times she\u2019s been sexually harassed is especially depressing because, as she notes, entitled assholes have plagued her from middle school into the present. Teachers, coworkers, restaurant patrons, a doctor, and a couple of Glazer\u2019s employees have all harassed her at some point. And whether she was waiting tables or running her own TV show, Glazer notes she was \u201ca woman in both places.\u201d The gall to then ask \u201care you sure?\u201d when she wanted to fire someone who\u2019d harassed her is the cherry on top of this shit sundae.\n\nUpdated October 18, 11:15 a.m.:\n\nTrace Lysette\n\nViola Davis\n\nCharlyne Yi\n\nShortly before sharing her story accusing comedian David Cross of racist harassment, Charlyne Yi added her voice to the \u201cMe Too\u201d movement as well:\n\nMcKayla Maroney\n\nThis morning, Olympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney came forward to reveal that she was repeatedly molested beginning at the age of 13. Her attacker was Larry Nassar, the former doctor for the U.S. Women\u2019s National and Olympic gymnastics teams who has been accused of assault by more than 100 women. Nassar pleaded guilty to federal child pornography charges in June, and is awaiting trial on 22 charges of sexually assaulting children in Michigan.\n\nMaureen Ryan\n\nAlso this morning, Variety chief TV critic Maureen Ryan published a powerful essay describing her sexual assault at the hands of an unnamed TV executive in 2014. Ryan ended up taking a leave of absence after the assault, after attempts to report her attacker were met with indifference at his company. (\u201cHe was reprimanded. That\u2019s it. I later heard that there were rumors of him harassing the network\u2019s assistants,\u201d she writes.)\n\nRyan\u2019s essay doubles as a call to action for men in Hollywood to take responsibility for the predators in their midst, and to start prioritizing the safety of victims\u2014many of whom leave the industry after learning that assault and harassment are the \u201cprice\u201d they\u2019re expected to pay for pursuing their dreams\u2014over the career prospects of predators. \u201cMen, listen up: You may not want to believe that your friend, your colleague, your collaborator is capable of this. Listen to me, LISTEN: The face he shows you may not be his only face,\u201d she writes. You can read her essay in full here.\n\nJanis Hirsch\n\nIn a guest column in The Hollywood Reporter, comedy writer Janis Hirsch recalls the persistent sexual harassment that drove her to leave her job as a staff writer on It\u2019s Garry Shandling\u2019s Show. Although Hirsch\u2019s contributions to the show\u2019s first season\u2014she wrote two of the first six episodes\u2014were well-received, she soon found herself excluded from the otherwise all-male writers\u2019 room, assigned only the \u201cslit scenes,\u201d a.k.a. scenes featuring the show\u2019s only female cast member. (Yeah.)\n\nFinally, Hirsch was told to quit her job by producer Brad Grey after an incident where one of the show\u2019s actors made the hilarious \u201cjoke\u201d of draping his flaccid penis on her shoulder \u201clike a pirate\u2019s dead parrot.\u201d She writes, \u201cMy mantra became, \u2018I won\u2019t cry until I get home.\u2019 It was amended to \u2018I won\u2019t cry until I get into the parking lot,\u2019 which became \u2018I won\u2019t cry until I get into the stairwell,\u2019 which morphed into \u2018Fuck, I\u2019m crying.\u2019\u201d Hirsch\u2019s essay ends on a rare positive note for these sorts of stories, relaying an anecdote where two younger female writers told her, \u201cThank you for getting that flaccid penis on your shoulder so we never had to.\u201d\n\nAlso in The Hollywood Reporter, a story called \u201cHollywood\u2019s Female Crew Members Suffer harassment Without The Platform Of Stardom\u201d tells the stories of dozens of crew members with stories like Hirsch\u2019s, many of whom speak anonymously for fear of retaliation.\n\nUpdated October 19, 10:03 a.m.:\n\nLaura Dern\n\nThe Big Little Lies and Twin Peaks actress opened up on The Ellen DeGeneres Show about the pervasiveness of sexual harassment in Hollywood, including how she had dismissed misconduct in the past. When Dern was honored at Elle\u2019s Women In Hollywood celebration earlier this week, she initially considered herself \u201cone of the lucky ones,\u201d i.e., one of the few women who hadn\u2019t been assaulted or harassed. She credited her actor parents, Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern, for teaching her early on about the dark side of Hollywood. But it wasn\u2019t until Dern was talking with her mother about the recent flood of revelations from other celebrities (and women in general) that she realized she\u2019d also been sexually harassed as a teen. \u201cIt was my mom who said, \u2018No, no, no, Laura. That was sexual assault. That was harassment, that was assault. No, you were 14 then,\u2019\u201d Dern told DeGeneres.\n\nUpdated October 24, 7:55 a.m.\n\nAnna Faris\n\nEntertainment Weekly reports Mom star Anna Faris opened up on her Unqualified podcast about her own experiences with sexual harassment, as well as the ways we condition women to laugh off mistreatment. The host recalled \u201cdoing a scene where I was on a ladder and I was supposed to be taking books off a shelf,\u201d when the director of the film \u201cslapped my ass in front of the crew so hard. And all I could do was giggle.\u201d Faris looked to the crew members who\u2019d witnessed the slap, which \u201cseemed weird,\u201d which was precisely how she tried to shrug the whole thing off. Like so many other women, she assumed responsibility for smoothing things over: \u201cI was like, \u2018Well, this isn\u2019t a thing. Like, it\u2019s not that big of a deal. Buck up, Faris. Like, just giggle.\u2019 But it made me feel small. He wouldn\u2019t have done that to the lead male.\u201d\n\nFarris and her guest, UnREAL\u2019s Arielle Kebbel, note that \u201cif we were to do anything else, we\u2019d be labeled a bitch or difficult. That would be the best of circumstances. I guess what I do is I laugh. It puts everyone at ease. That\u2019s the defense mode you go into.\u201d\n\nUpdated November 3, 2:00 p.m.\n\nJessica Barth\n\nYesterday, Ted and Ted 2 star Jessica Barth went to the LAPD to revive a sexual assault accusation first leveled in 2012 against her ex-manager, David Guillod. Barth says she decided to revive the charges after another, unnamed woman came to her to say she had a similar experience with Guillod. The email that inspired Barth to pursue her case anew was in response to a guest post Barth published in The Wrap last week called, \u201cJessica Barth Wants To Bring Survivors Together With #WhoIsYourHarvey.\u201d\n\nThe post does not specifically name as Barth\u2019s attacker, but it does detail her story of a manager who pursued her aggressively, first as a client and then for a sexual relationship. Despite her repeated rejections, he persisted, and in 2012 Barth says Guillod sexually assaulted her after drugging her wine at a dinner at a restaurant attended by Barth, one of her friends, and Guillod. She writes:\n\nAt first, I went through textbook emotions experienced by victims of sexual assault. I felt completely ashamed and like it was my fault. Over and over in my mind, ran self-blaming thoughts like, I should have trusted my goddamn instincts, I never should have gone, and I should not have had any wine. I was in a committed relationship that meant the world to me. He knew this. I talked about my relationship throughout the whole dinner. I felt devastated, humiliated and completely violated. I felt this way because he was the one who devastated me, he humiliated me, he violated me.\n\nThis was years ago and I did not possess the strength or the confidence that I possess today. I was so wrapped up in blaming myself that I failed to even recognize that I had been sexually assaulted. That is how blinding shame can become.\n\nGuillod has since taken a leave of absence from his company Primary Wave as Barth\u2019s charges are investigated. In reporting its story, The Wrap found that Guillod\u2014who recently executive produced Atomic Blonde, and whose clients include Gina Rodriguez, Nia Long, and Emilio Estevez\u2014left two previous talent agency jobs after being charged with sexual harassment. As for Barth, she says, \u201cI want to prosecute him. I want to do whatever is in my power to make sure this never happens to another woman.\u201d\n\nUpdated November 22, 1:00 p.m.:\n\nGabby Douglas\n\nAfter making comments critical of her teammates McKayla Maroney (see above) and Aly Raisman\u2019s allegations of sexual abuse against their former U.S. Women\u2019s National and Olympic team coach Larry Nassar, three-time Olympic gold medalist Gabby Douglas has come forward to reveal that Nassar sexually abused her, too. She did so in a new apology to her teammates posted on Instagram, following up on a shorter previous apology hashtagged #MeToo. In the post, Douglas speaks in vague terms about the abuse she suffered, placing it in the context of a since-deleted tweet that read, \u201cIt is our responsibility as women to dress modestly and be classy. Dressing in a provocative/sexy way entices the wrong crowd.\u201d\n\nIn her new statement, Douglas says that \u201cI understand many of you didn\u2019t know what I was dealing with,\u201d and clarifies that she does not advocate \u201cvictim shaming or blaming in any way, shape, or form.\u201d She says, \u201cI didn\u2019t publicly share my experiences as well as many other things because for years we were conditioned to stay silent and honestly some things were extremely painful. I wholeheartedly support my teammates for coming forward with what happened to them.\u201d", "images": ["https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/avuploads/2025/11/12174022/tcc6-recap-squared.jpg",
