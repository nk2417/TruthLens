On top of all that, Caitlin (Danielle Panabaker) has succumbed to her Killer Frost persona and is on the run. All of this is juggled by first-time \u201cFlash\u201d director, and series\u2019 star, Tom Cavanagh.\n\nVariety spoke with Cavanagh \u2014 who has played three separate versions of the same character across the show\u2019s three seasons; currently H.R. Wells, and previously Harry Wells and Harrison Wells \u2014 about directing different versions of the main characters, how being behind the camera this time differed from his previous directing gigs, and more.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nHow did directing an episode come about? Was it something you wanted to do or did they approach you about it?\n\nGenerally, when I am signing a contract for a television series, we have a handshake deal in there about directing. This is my third show for Greg Berlanti, and they sort of know I like to direct. In the past the stuff that I\u2019ve done seems to have been well-enough received that it allowed me to forge forth.\n\nDid you know when you said you\u2019d direct that it would be this big Barry-heads-to-the-future episode?\n\nThey do a ridiculous amount of episodes of \u201cFlash\u201d every year. \u201cThe Flash\u201d is one of the most prepared television shows I\u2019ve ever been on, and for the amount of work that comes through the pipeline they are incredibly on top of it. As a director \u2014 I\u2019ve been on shows where the director gets the script on the first day of shooting \u2014 they will get a script for the entire length of the prep. It gives you a fighting chance.\n\nIn terms of what the actual story is going to be, they\u2019ve got a story arc when they start the season but you don\u2019t really know where your story is going to fall. I feel very fortunate to deal with Barry \u2026 dealing with Barry. That\u2019s two versions of Grant Gustin, which is phenomenal. I was grateful to have this storyline.\n\nYou\u2019re no stranger of playing multiple versions of the same character, or acting opposite yourself. Was it fun directing altered, future versions of the other characters?\n\nThat\u2019s part of the aspect of this episode that I really, really liked. We see a whole different world. We got to mess some stuff up. I\u2019ve played five or six or seven different versions of myself since the show started but most of the cast has just played one or two versions of their character. In this one, I think it was great for them to pull out of the hat another version of themselves. I think both Grant and Carlos Valdes in particular were exceptional in this episode. They\u2019re very talented to begin with, but then you add these different layers you kind of marvel at their abilities.\n\nHow is it to direct yourself?\n\nI always find it\u2019s really good. If you write something and you have the visual of that in your head, I don\u2019t have to convince the actor \u2014 or even explain to the actor \u2014 what the visual is. So I can accommodate however I want. One thing I will say, though, if anyone is going to get short-changed when I\u2019m directing it\u2019s not going to be the other actors; it\u2019s going to be me. You become much less self-indulgent.\n\n\u201cThe Flash\u201d airs on the CW on Tuesdays at 8 p.m.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-flash-3x19.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-flash-3x19.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacob Bryant", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/the-flash-tom-cavanagh-directing-barry-allen-savitar-1202395034/", "title": "\u2018The Flash\u2019 Star Tom Cavanagh Talks Directing This Week\u2019s Episode", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"The Flash\" star Tom Cavanagh talks about his first time directing an episode of the show.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Jacob Bryant", "tags": "The Flash, Tom Cavanagh", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018The Flash\u2019 Star Tom Cavanagh Talks Directing This Week\u2019s Episode", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/the-flash-tom-cavanagh-directing-barry-allen-savitar-1202395034/", "description": "\"The Flash\" star Tom Cavanagh talks about his first time directing an episode of the show.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-flash-3x19.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "The Flash"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-04-25T18:36:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-04-25T18:36:11+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"The Flash\" star Tom Cavanagh talks about his first time directing an episode of the show.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@Jacobb41", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018The Flash\u2019 Star Tom Cavanagh Talks Directing This Week\u2019s Episode", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/the-flash-3x19.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493145371.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
