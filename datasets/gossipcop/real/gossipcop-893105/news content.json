{"url": "https://ew.com/recap/the-arrangement-season-1-episode-2/", "text": "Last week, our girl Megan Morrison had a LOT going on: She dumped her boyfriend, she booked a big movie role\u2026 oh, and she signed a $10 million marriage contract with Kyle West. What a roller coaster! But this week, her drive is clear and simple: Megan is horny!\n\nShe\u2019s clearly enjoying her new life as the future Mrs. Kyle West. We know this because we see her smiling in Kyle\u2019s shower in between aspirational close-ups of the fancy faucets. This house is luxe AF! Megan steps out of the shower, ready for some lovemaking with her fianc\u00e9, but she\u2019s interrupted by his assistant Ben. Ben keeps showing up right when Megan\u2019s feeling frisky; he\u2019s a real boner killer, but he\u2019s also great at managing the details for her upcoming jaunt to the Venice Film Festival for Kyle\u2019s big premiere of the priest/war movie AWOL.\n\nDavid Miscavige Terence Anderson is supposed to skip Venice to stay home and work on his new book for Scientology The Institute of the Higher Mind (IHM). He\u2019s sending his wife Shelly Miscavige Deann (also Kyle\u2019s producing partner) along in his place. But when Deann stops by his office to discuss the trip, the dialogue that ensues is downright puzzling. Do yourself a favor: grab your favorite scene partner and read this one out loud for a fun segment of The Arrangement theatre.\n\nDEANN: \u201cI see you\u2019ve made plans to join us in Venice.\u201d\n\nTERENCE: \u201cThat\u2019s because I couldn\u2019t bear the thought of being here without you.\u201d\n\nDEANN: \u201cHmm, I imagine that must be very hard for you.\u201d\n\nTERENCE (pressed against her): \u201cIt\u2019s getting hard for you actually.\u201d (Why is everyone so horny this week?!)\n\nDEANN: \u201cYou\u2019re mirroring me.\u201d\n\nTERENCE: \u201cDoes it feel as false for you as it does for me?\u201d\n\nI had to re-watch this doozy five times before I realized that Deann is saying \u201cYou\u2019re mirroring me\u201d (apparently an IHM mind-control technique) even though it definitely sounds like she\u2019s saying \u201cYou\u2019re marrying me,\u201d which would be a real curve ball. (Wha? They\u2019re not married? He says it feels false? Do they have an Arrangement too?! I don\u2019t know what\u2019s real anymore!) I blame this confusion on Lexa Doig\u2019s Canadian accent (the show is filmed in Vancouver, and not to brag, but I have a Canadian boyfriend, so I consider myself an expert on detecting Canadian accents. My boyfriend disagrees). Moving on!\n\nBack at Megan\u2019s place, her friend Hope and her other friend (whose name I cannot for the life of me figure out) squeal as Megan shows off the fancy dresses she\u2019ll be wearing in Venice, thanks to Kyle\u2019s IHM-sponsored stylist. (Apparently Megan still has her place and her friends! I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll all be changing soon.) But their fun makeover montage is interrupted by Megan\u2019s ex-boyfriend Nic (the scruffy rocker dude who cheated on her last week). Nic just heard about this Kyle West thing, and he\u2019s pissed!\n\nMegan and Nic step outside to scream at each other. (Imagine walking your dog in the early aughts and spotting Katie Holmes and Chris Klein in a front-lawn fight. Simpler times! But honestly I\u2019d love to see them back together.) Nic reminds us that Megan has a shady secret from her past that\u2019s sure to come back and bite her: \u201cKyle West is a movie star! He\u2019s just looking for some nobody-hot-actress to keep him warm for a week. And he\u2019s gonna be real bummed when he finds out you can\u2019t even do that!\u201d (No one has ever sounded more Canadian than this guy saying this line. Ever. My Canadian boyfriend agrees.)\n\nJust as Kyle, Megan and Deann are leaving for Venice, Terence gives Megan a warning: Nicole Kidman Lisbeth Graves is gonna be there, and it\u2019s gonna be awkward, and she needs to watch what she does with her face with all those photographers around! That means no sad faces and no angry faces. \u201cBe mindful,\u201d he warns her gravely. \u201cBye bitch,\u201d she basically replies.\n\nNEXT: Megan is foiled again\n\nAt the festival, Megan sits in the audience for the final scene of AWOL: Music swells as we zoom in on a bloodied Kyle (clutching his cross, wearing his priest collar), uttering his final word: \u201cMaria\u2026\u201d She\u2019s moved to tears and tells Kyle afterward, \u201cYour acting inspires me.\u201d And she hasn\u2019t even begun her IHM mind-training yet!\n\nDeann reminds them they have an important film festival cocktail thing, but in one of SEVERAL montages set to clearable pop music, Kyle and Megan play hooky and sneak out into the streets undercover: Hats! Trench coats! Fake mustaches! They walk through the canals, swept up in the beauty of Venice, and Kyle asks Megan that timeless question that Italian lovers have been asking for centuries: \u201cWhat was your first concert?\u201d (Megan\u2019s answer: Backstreet Boys. Mine: Cyndi Lauper. My mom is amazing!) Kyle surprises Megan with dinner on a boat he has chartered, or something, and she swoons. More clearable pop music kicks in as they sip champagne, French kiss each other, and stare at the sea meaningfully. Once again, Megan just wants to lovemake\u2026 but Kyle\u2019s gotta get back to work.\n\nSome actress/new IHM recruit, Annika, keeps calling Deann to remind us that they\u2019re up to no good, and to tell Deann she\u2019s not happy with these headlines she\u2019s seeing about Kyle and Megan\u2019s whirlwind romance. And finally we learn Kyle and Megan\u2019s celeb-name portmanteau: KYGAN. (Sounds like your worst friend\u2019s toddler\u2019s name, right? Although in retrospect, \u201cTomKat\u201d wasn\u2019t so great either. Also, I believe that my queen Jen Aniston chose Justin Theroux primarily because their names could not be mashed-up in a catchy way. Go ahead and try. Theraniston? Jenstin? Justifer? Actually Justifer\u2019s not the worst\u2026)\n\nKyle does a Skype meditation/auditing sesh with Terence. (Can we just call him \u201cTerry\u201d for fun? Let\u2019s LIVE, you guys!) Terry tells Kyle to take all that anxiety he\u2019s feeling about running into Lisbeth, put it into an invisible clay ball in his hands, and then put that clay ball of feelings down on the table and leave it there. Seems like\u2026 kind of good advice?\n\nMegan\u2019s not having the best time at the festival. There\u2019s a tense run-in with Kyle and Lisbeth, and a photographer catches Megan\u2019s stank-faced reaction. (The media eats it up: Is Kygan on the rocks already?!) Lisbeth walks in on Megan taking bathroom selfies, and when Megan tries to break the ice, Lisbeth tells her she\u2019s not here to make friends. (Nicole Kidman would never!) And back at the hotel, when Megan tries to seduce Kyle wearing nothing but a masquerade mask, he falls asleep. The poor girl just wants to bone!\n\nBut Megan does make a friend at the festival: free-spirited indie actress Daisy Something (Brit Morgan). Daisy and her friends insist that Megan come party with them. Megan\u2019s in her Lululemons, ready to use the hotel gym, but throws caution to the wind, shoots her sleeping fianc\u00e9 a text, and goes to the clerb. She does a few shots, but when Daisy and her friends start making fun of sellout Kyle West (they\u2019re the only ones in Venice who don\u2019t know about Kygan yet), Megan decides to call it a night and heads back to the hotel.\n\nMegan is followed by a sweaty, leering local dude who is pretty much the most grotesque Italian caricature ever: \u201cHey, American girl like to party! Mafia pasta sexy time gimme kiss American girl!\u201d (My Canadian boyfriend is also Italian, and during this scene he announced he\u2019ll no longer be watching The Arrangement with me. I\u2019m bummed, but in his defense, he\u2019s been missing Feud for this thing.)\n\nKyle comes to the rescue, chases the Italian guy away, and yells at Megan for leaving the hotel. A paparazzo captures their argument, Kyle punches the guy\u2019s lights out, and Deann steps in to pay him off. Back at the hotel, Kyle broods over the paparazzo incident and Megan comforts him lovingly. And then finally \u2013 FINALLY! \u2013 they lovemake by the fire.\n\nThe next morning, Megan is standing on the sidelines watching Kyle\u2019s press junket when Terry rolls up. Ugh! He\u2019s not pleased with the recent Kygan stories about Megan making a sad face \u2013 he warned her not to make a sad face! \u2013 and threatens to terminate the contract. And just when Megan is about to be like, \u201cUm, no, bitch,\u201d Terry pulls out his phone: He\u2019s got Megan\u2019s bathroom selfie! Her friend Hope tweeted it! Or something. It\u2019s unclear\u2026 but it\u2019s not good. He tells her she needs to manage her problem with authority. And we\u2019re left wondering: Is this what Trump says to Kellyanne? Or, more importantly, is this what Miscavige said to Leah Remini? Which brings me to the most important question of them all, a question I\u2019ll keep shouting from the rooftops until we have an answer: Where\u2019s our Leah Remini cameo?!", "images":
