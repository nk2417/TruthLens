However, both he and partner Lindsay Arnold are dealing with injuries that could keep the pair from taking home the top spot.\n\nIn a new clip shared by E! News, cameras captured the moment Arnold\u2019s finger sliced into her partner\u2019s eye during rehearsal, leaving Fisher with a painful-looking scratch on his cornea.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\nAlong with his eye injury, Arnold is also dealing with a knee injury that she sustained during rehearsals for last week\u2019s show.\n\n\u201cBetween Lindsay\u2019s knee and my eye, we\u2019re both not in the place that we would like to be for the finale week, but you know, you do what you can,\u201d Fisher says in the clip.\n\nTo help keep his scratch from becoming irritated, Fisher\u2019s eye doctor gave him a contact to wear, but that isn\u2019t doing much to help with the pain.\n\nAfter last week\u2019s show, during which Arnold wore a knee brace, the pair admitted it was the hardest one yet.\n\n\u201cWe really had to rely on each other throughout this,\u201d Arnold told E! News. \u201cFor me as a pro, usually I\u2019m the one who can be the shoulder to lean on. I needed Jordan today as much as he needed me. I feel like that\u2019s how we were able to get through this incredibly insane day.\u201d\n\nFisher added, \u201cWe\u2019re both kind of battered and bruised right now and both very exhausted, but I couldn\u2019t be more grateful to be able to share this experience with Lindsay.\u201d\n\nThe Dancing with the Stars finale airs Monday at 8 p.m. ET and Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\nPhoto Credit: ABC", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/70afec6a-3143-4947-b047-428e525611d4.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hannah Barnes", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/news/jordan-fisher-eye-injury-dancing-with-the-stars-lindsay-arnold/", "title": "Could Jordan Fisher\u2019s Eye Injury Keep Him From Winning DWTS?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Could Jordan Fisher's Eye Injury Keep Him From Winning DWTS?", "description": "Dancing With the Stars is almost at the finish line for Season 25, and singer and actor Jordan Fisher has been a major contender for the Mirrorball Trophy all season long.
