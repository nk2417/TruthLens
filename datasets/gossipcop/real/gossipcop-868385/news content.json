Thorne kept it real with her 6.66 million followers telling them, \u201cI don\u2019t even masturbate like that.\u201d\n\nThe NSFW footage is thought to have been created by splicing snippets from Thorne\u2019s Snapchat videos with clips from an adult film. Thorne is shown talking while riding in her car.\n\nAudio from her Snapchat video is muted and dubbed over with someone talking about her \u201cneed for a father.\u201d\n\nAfter clearing the air, the Florida native shamed the video\u2019s creator, who hasn\u2019t been identified, for \u201cmaking fun of\u201d the loss of her father. Thorne\u2019s dad, Reinaldo Thorne, died in 2007 in a motorcycle accident.\n\nThe actress didn\u2019t stay angry for long. According to E! Online she later posted a video on Snapchat, feigning an orgasm in what appeared to be her effort to reclaim the story.\n\n\u201cSo good! So Good! Oh, yes! Oh, yeah! That\u2019s the spot! Oh! Right there! Oh, Yeah! That\u2019s it! My goodness! Keep going! Keep going,\u201d she shouts while petting a kitten, a watermelon and a stuffed animal.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/07/21/VPRPIHZTQYZ6JFYW3V2N4MFTNI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/07/21/VPRPIHZTQYZ6JFYW3V2N4MFTNI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caitlyn Hitt"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/07/21/bella-thorne-laughs-off-fake-masturbation-video-circulating-online/", "title": "Bella Thorne laughs off fake masturbation video circulating online", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Caitlyn Hitt", "canonical": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/07/21/bella-thorne-laughs-off-fake-masturbation-video-circulating-online/"}, "description": "\"Wait you guys think this is real?\"", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Bella Thorne laughs off fake masturbation video circulating online", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/07/21/bella-thorne-laughs-off-fake-masturbation-video-circulating-online/", "description": "Bella Thorne is unbothered.
