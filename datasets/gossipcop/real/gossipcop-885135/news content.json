For one, the actors are older, and age can slow even the seemingly indestructible Jackie Chan. For another, Chris Tucker became a born-again Christian and that impacted his career choices in a major way.\n\nIn a recent interview with an L.A. radio station, however, action superstar Chan revealed Rush Hour 4 is basically a go. Only one potential obstacle remains.\n\nSo the script for the new film, according to Chan, \u201cwill have a second draft\u201d by the end of October, and filming will \u201cprobably\u201d begin in 2018.\n\n\u201cIf,\u201d says Chan, \u201cChris Tucker agrees.\u201d\n\nWhile EW reported that Tucker \u201chas yet to comment publicly\u201d about wanting to do a new Rush Hour, this MovieHole post from July seems to contradict that statement. It notes an appearance Tucker made on The View in which he said he and Chan \u201cwere talking about some stuff [for Rush Hour 4] so we\u2019re thinking about doing something like that.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll keep our fingers crossed that Tucker is still as open to the idea as he seemed in July.\n\nIn the meantime, anyone who wants a dose of Jackie Chan-style action can check out The Foreigner, his new\u2014and serious\u2014action film. It hits US theaters on October 13.\n\nh/t EW", "images": ["https://www.maxim.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=336,height=94,fit=crop,quality=90,gravity=auto,sharpen=1,metadata=none,format=auto,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/maxim-logo-transparent-1.png", "https://www.maxim.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=788,height=444,fit=crop,quality=90,gravity=auto,sharpen=1,metadata=none,format=auto,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rush-hour-promo-new-line.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=145,height=30,fit=crop,quality=90,gravity=auto,sharpen=1,metadata=none,format=auto,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/maxim-footer-logo.png", "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rush-hour-promo-new-line.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rush-hour-promo-new-line.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Steve Huff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.maxim.com/entertainment/rush-hour-4-jackie-chan-chris-tucker-2017-10/", "title": "Jackie Chan Confirms That \u2018Rush Hour 4\u2019 Is Coming, But There\u2019s One Big Catch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "pubexchange": {"image": "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rush-hour-promo-new-line-428x241.jpg"}, "description": "This needs to happen.", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jackie Chan Confirms That 'Rush Hour 4' Is Coming, But There's One Big Catch - Maxim", "description": "This needs to happen.", "url": "https://www.maxim.com/entertainment/rush-hour-4-jackie-chan-chris-tucker-2017-10/", "site_name": "Maxim", "updated_time": "2022-07-29T22:29:04-04:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rush-hour-promo-new-line.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rush-hour-promo-new-line.jpg", "width": 850, "height": 478, "alt": "Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in Rush Hour 3", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"tag": "sequels", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-10-06T14:49:05-04:00", "modified_time": "2022-07-29T22:29:04-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jackie Chan Confirms That 'Rush Hour 4' Is Coming, But There's One Big Catch - Maxim", "description": "This needs to happen.", "creator": "@stevehuff", "image": "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rush-hour-promo-new-line.jpg", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Steve Huff", "label2": "Time to read", "data2": "1 minute"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cropped-maxim-favicon-270x270.png"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/JMiFsFQcFLE?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/oHoQsRU1sGo?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1507315745.0, "source": "https://www.maxim.com", "summary": ""}
