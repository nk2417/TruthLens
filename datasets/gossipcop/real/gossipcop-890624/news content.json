Read our Privacy notice\n\nOnce upon a simpler time, we cleansed, toned and moisturised. Today, there is a new step to add to that skin-enhancing list: anti-ageing serums. Specialist, potent treatments that aim to turn back the clock, by helping to erase crow\u2019s feet, wrinkles, dryness and melasma (pigmentation from sun damage), they contain a concentrated amount of high-performing active ingredients. They come in small bottles and have a light-as-a-feather consistency, unlike heavy-duty moisturisers for mature skin.\n\nMost of the serums chosen below contain a cocktail of acids, vitamins, omega oils and collagen peptides. Vitamin C in particular can reduce pigmentation, while peptides are strings of molecules called amino acids, which are the \"building blocks\" of healthy skin. Hyaluronic acid is also a major component of skin, involved in repairing tissue, and omega oils are naturally occurring and hydrate skin. These have been shown to help reverse the effects of ageing, benefitting and plumping the surface, making wrinkles appear diminished and smoothing the skin with their exfoliating, softening powers.\n\nUse a pea-sized amount, as they are concentrates, so a little goes a long way. In terms of bang for your buck, formulas can cost anything from \u00a312 up to almost \u00a3150, but which ones are worth the money? Scroll on to find out.\n\nHow I tested\n\nI assessed each serum over a three-week period ( Jane Druker )\n\nI tested each of the reviewed products for at least three weeks. I used some daily in the morning and evening, others twice weekly \u2013 both of which are recommended by the beauty glitterati. Some formulas are historical favourites of mine and others are brand new. As they have high-potency ingredients, build up to using twice daily over a few weeks (especially if you have sensitive skin) and target specific areas \u2013 lines, crow\u2019s feet, wrinkles and dry spots or melasma \u2013 instead, to see a positive, swift difference.\n\nWhy you can trust IndyBest reviews\n\nJane Druker is an experienced beauty editor who has written for the likes of Vogue, The Telegraph and, of course, The Independent. Well placed to discuss anti-ageing skincare, she\u2019s covered everything from tinted moisturisers for mature skin to anti-ageing night creams. She knows the brands that do and don\u2019t work when it comes to minimising, fine lines, wrinkles and hyperpigmentation, and will only recommend products she believes are worth your money.\n\nThe best anti-ageing serums for 2025 are:", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/11/18/04/lyma-laser-review-indybest-independent.png",
