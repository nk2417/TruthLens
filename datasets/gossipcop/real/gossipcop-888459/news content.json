The documentary was directed by Hannah Lux Davis and is time-capsuled by the creation of her sixth studio album Tell Me You Love Me (Sept. 29). It\u2019s no coincidence that Lovato\u2019s new documentary coincides with her most vulnerable music to date.\n\nExplore Demi Lovato See latest videos, charts and news\n\nSimply Complicated is just under an hour and 20 minutes long with not a minute wasted. In the first minute, we learn from Demi herself, \u201cI actually had anxiety around this interview because the last time I did an interview this long, I was on cocaine.\u201d\n\nHere are 10 of the most honest, revealing moments from Simply Complicated.\n\nThe opening monologue\n\nWe all knew that the purpose of this documentary was to let every crevice of who Demi Lovato has been and is now breathe, but there\u2019s something quite poignant when hearing Lovato deliver this opening monologue that ensures viewers know the exact tone of what she\u2019s about to show you.\n\n\u201cI am Demi Lovato,\u201d she says over a voiceover while clips from her life flash by. \u201cI\u2019m 25. The last decade has taught me a lifetime of lessons. I\u2019ve learned that secrets make you sick. I\u2019m learning how to be a voice and not a victim. I\u2019ve learned that sex is natural. I\u2019ve learned that love is necessary. Heartbreak is unavoidable, and loneliness is brutal. I\u2019ve learned that the key to being happy is to tell your truth and be OK without all the answers. This is my story. This is Simply Complicated.\u201d\n\nProof that she\u2019s a perfectionist\n\nAll footage of Lovato recording several songs off Tell Me You Love Me features Lovato demanding as many takes as possible until it\u2019s absolutely right \u2014 down to every single word recorded.\n\n\u201cI really like this take,\u201d her producer says during a studio session for \u201cYou Don\u2019t Do It For Me Anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just that last \u2018Oh\u2019 needs to be smoothed out,\u201d Lovato responds from the booth.\n\nThe producer shrugs, \u201cYeah. I mean, in a perfect world, absolutely.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, this should be a perfect world,\u201d she says matter-of-factly. \u201cIt\u2019s my album.\u201d\n\nThe depths of her battles against addiction and bipolar disorder\n\nIt\u2019s revealed \u2014 through interviews with Lovato, her mother, a childhood friend and her sister, Dallas \u2014 Lovato was bullied intensely in school as a child (by, Dallas says, \u201cthis core group of girls who honestly in my eyes were pure fucking evil\u201d). It got to such a point that one girl in particular made a petition for Lovato to kill herself.\n\nShe became friends with one of the popular girls, who encouraged Lovato to start \u201cpartying,\u201d which introduced Lovato to the alcohol and drugs (Adderall and cocaine) that she would soon be dependent on to get through days. Lovato says that the first time she used cocaine, when she was 17 years old and working on Disney Channel. \u201cI was scared because my mom always told me that your heart could just burst if you do it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I did it anyways, and I loved it the first time that I did it.\u201d\n\nLovato\u2019s biological father, who was not part of her life since childhood before passing away from cancer in 2013, was an addict and alcoholic. \u201cI guess I always searched for what he found in drugs and alcohol because it fulfilled him, and he chose that over a family.\u201d\n\nThings got completely out of control in her teen years while touring with the Jonas Brothers, touring on her own and working on Camp Rock, touring for Camp Rock. Specifically, while touring for Camp Rock 2, Lovato threw a huge party at a hotel one night where she was drinking and using Adderall. Once she learned the next day that one of her dancers had told on her for using Adderall, she promptly punched that dancer in the face. This resulted in entering treatment for the first time at 18 years old and there, Lovato was officially diagnosed bipolar.\n\nThe treatment didn\u2019t last, though. Once out, Lovato says, \u201cI wasn\u2019t working my program. I wasn\u2019t ready to get sober. I was sneaking it on planes, sneaking it in bathrooms, sneaking it throughout the night. Nobody knew.\u201d\n\nWhat followed was a two-month period where she was using every day. One night, she did cocaine and took Xanax. \u201cI started to choke a little bit,\u201d she says. \u201cMy heart started racing, and I remember thinking, \u2018Oh my God, I might be overdosing right now.'\u201d\n\nA separate time, in Palm Springs, she actually did almost overdose after locking her bedroom door \u2014 and when a nurse was carting her away to the hospital, she defiantly grabbed a bottle containing more pills and downed them all.\n\n\u201cDemi was on a road to suicide\u201d\n\nMike Bayer was contacted by Demi\u2019s manager Phil McIntyre to help him help Demi. Bayer is now Lovato\u2019s personal development coach. In the documentary, Bayer says, \u201cDemi was on a road to suicide. She\u2019d have bags of pills and an 8 ball of coke.\u201d\n\nEither craving drugs or on drugs, she admits, \u201cI was not easy to work with. I was using while I had a sober companion, and I went through about 20 different sober companions. I didn\u2019t feel anything. I didn\u2019t feel guilty. I didn\u2019t feel embarrassed. I would sneak out, get drugs. I would fake my drug tests with other people\u2019s pee, and I\u2019d lie straight to their faces. It\u2019s embarrassing to look back at the person that I was.\u201d\n\nPhil McIntyre almost dropped her\n\nAnd that was the breaking point. \u201cI was fully intending to drop her,\u201d McIntyre says.\n\nEverybody on Lovato\u2019s management team approached her one day to inform her that there was nothing more they could do for her. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a matter of if they were going to leave,\u201d Lovato remembers. \u201cIt was, \u2018We are leaving. There\u2019s no more we can do for you.'\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember her crying,\u201d Bayer remembers. \u201cGoing, \u2018What the fuck do I need to do? What do I need to do?'\u201d\n\nMembers of her management team told her to give them her cell phone. Lovato smashed it and dunked into water. \u201cThis was the gateway to everything,\u201d McIntyre says while holding the shattered phone. \u201cThis was the wrong people, it was drug dealers, it was a lot of the negative influences in her life were coming through the cellphone.\u201d\n\nThey still have that phone, but Lovato has been sober ever since.\n\n\u201cYou really have to lean into the people that are trying to support you,\u201d Lovato says. \u201cLike my family, like Mike and Phil. You really have to surrender because that\u2019s when the change is gonna happen.\u201d\n\nBest manager ever @philymack A post shared by Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) on Oct 6, 2017 at 6:47pm PDT\n\nShe used to want to be Amy Winehouse\n\nAs a young girl, Demi\u2019s mother says, Demi had drawn a picture of what she perceived herself to look like in her diary. On the next page was a drawing of what \u201cwhat I need to look like to be a star.\u201d Demi pulls out a collage from her closet that she had made when she was younger, featuring women with bodies she wanted.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be like them,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was the chic look back then. I\u2019ve got Amy Winehouse in there that I looked up to and wanted to be so badly. I wanted to be as thin as her, I wanted to sing like her, I wanted to be just like her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pictures on her wall,\u201d Lovato\u2019s mother says. \u201cAnd the pictures. And the models. This isn\u2019t what you need to aspire to be like. This isn\u2019t healthy. I never thought to say those things to her because I didn\u2019t know myself. My desire for perfection, I think I\u2019ve always been that way. I felt I had to be thin and beautiful and successful. \u2026 I may have passed that along to my kids.\u201d\n\nShe knew she loved Wilmer Valderrama the minute she first saw him\n\nWhile in the car with one of her sisters and her mother in their home state Texas, Lovato begins crying remembering that the last time they were in Texas was for the funeral of her beloved great-grandmother whom she called Mamaw. Also realizing that it had been a year since she and Valderrama had broken up, she admits that she has never loved anybody the way she loved her ex-boyfriend.\n\n\u201cI still love Wilmer,\u201d she says. They first met when Lovato was 17 years old and he was 29. She remembers that they met on January 11, 2010, at his home for a PSA shoot.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I only did it because I heard it was at his house,\u201d she says, \u201cand I thought he was really cute. I didn\u2019t really care about the census forms. But when I met him and laid eyes on him for the first time, I was in hair and makeup and he came and sat down, and I was like, \u2018I love this man, and I have to have him.'\u201d\n\nOnce Lovato turned 18, they began dating \u2014 \u201cI think it was love at first sight, and I don\u2019t really believe in that, but I believe that it happened. We connected on a level that I\u2019ve never connected with anybody before. He was just my rock, my everything.\u201d\n\nWhen asked why she thinks they broke up, she says it has nothing to do with being in love but maybe being better as friends. Lovato knew she had some things she needed to take care of on her own without depending on somebody else to heal her loneliness.\n\nLovato and Valderrama are seen in the documentary at a party together seemingly very cordial and still friendly. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll lose him for the rest of my life,\u201d Lovato says. \u201cI think my heart\u2019s always with Wilmer. I think that it was with Wilmer, I think that it is with Wilmer, and I think that it will be. You don\u2019t share six years with somebody and not give them a piece of your heart, and vice-versa. I\u2019m pretty sure that I\u2019m not gonna meet anybody that compares to him, but I\u2019m trying to keep an open heart and an open mind when it comes to that.\u201d\n\nProud to present\u2026 #SimplyComplicated. Watch the full documentary now on @YouTube!! Link is in my bio \u2014 A post shared by Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) on Oct 17, 2017 at 10:08am PDT\n\nShe is actively dating \u2014 even on celebrity dating app Raya \u2014 both men and women\n\n\u201cI matched with somebody on Raya just now,\u201d Lovato tells her stylist Avo Yermagyan.\n\nThe camera cuts to just Demi on the couch, where she says, \u201cI am on the dating app with both guys and girls. I am open to human connection, so whether that\u2019s through a male or a female, it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d\n\nShe still struggles with an eating disorder\n\nWhile Lovato is singing \u201cSmoke & Mirrors\u201d (only available on the deluxe version of her album) in the background, she explains that there is still one demon she has not been able to fully conquer.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t relapsed in drugs and alcohol,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s something that I\u2019m very proud of. I\u2019m coming up on five and half years of sobriety, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s been difficult at times, but one thing that I haven\u2019t fully conquered is my eating disorder.\u201d\n\nWe then see Lovato in the back of a car with McIntyre, whom she tells that \u201ca few nights ago\u201d she had relapsed \u2014 bingeing and purging \u2014 triggered because she started to miss Wilmer. \u201cThe less I have to think about food, the easier it is for me to go about having a normal life,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to let anybody down. So when I do have moments when I slip up, I feel very ashamed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was in a relationship with Wilmer, I went three years without purging,\u201d she continues. \u201cWhen we broke up, that\u2019s one of the first things I did. When I feel lonely, my heart feels hungry, and then I end up bingeing, and I don\u2019t know how to figure out how to be alone.\u201d\n\nLovato says that her first addiction was food, she is constantly thinking about food and she is envious of the people who don\u2019t have to struggle with an eating disorder.\n\nMMA and Brazilian jujitsu has become a saving grace for her\n\nThanks to her personal development coach, Bayer, Lovato latched onto Unbreakable Gym just after her breakup with Valderrama. There, she trains in MMA and jujitsu. Her goal is to one day earn a black belt.\n\n\u201cThe gym really helps,\u201d she says. \u201cI know that I would be a very dark place without it. Any time I\u2019m able to take my mind off of any of my addictions, it\u2019s very beneficial to me because you\u2019re constantly thinking about what the next move is. The technique, the strategy\u2026 Working out is a form of meditation to me because I\u2019m not focused on anything in my head. It can transport you to a totally different place. I\u2019m on a journey to discover what it\u2019s like to be free of all demons.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the full documentary below:", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/demi-lovato-simply-complicated-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/demi-lovato-simply-complicated-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Armstrong", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/demi-lovato-simply-complicated-documentary-youtube-best-moments-8005791/", "title": "The 10 Most Honest Confessions From Demi Lovato\u2019s \u2018Simply Complicated\u2019 YouTube Documentary", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Demi Lovato peeled back all the layers on Tuesday (Oct. 17) with the arrival of her documentary, Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated, exclusively to YouTube.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Megan Armstrong", "tags": "billboard news, demi lovato, TCD", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "The 10 Most Honest Confessions From Demi Lovato\u2019s \u2018Simply Complicated\u2019 YouTube Documentary", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/demi-lovato-simply-complicated-documentary-youtube-best-moments-8005791/", "description": "Demi Lovato peeled back all the layers on Tuesday (Oct. 17) with the arrival of her documentary, Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated, exclusively to YouTube.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/demi-lovato-simply-complicated-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-18T17:26:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-19T13:11:09+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Demi Lovato peeled back all the layers on Tuesday (Oct. 17) with the arrival of her documentary, Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated, exclusively to YouTube.", "site": "@billboard", "creator": "@meganKarmstrong", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The 10 Most Honest Confessions From Demi Lovato\u2019s \u2018Simply Complicated\u2019 YouTube Documentary", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/demi-lovato-simply-complicated-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508347586.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
