{"url": "https://people.com/music/demi-lovato-grateful-home-vote-after-rehab/", "text": "After leaving rehab, Demi Lovato has returned to Instagram with an important message.\n\nOn Tuesday, the singer, 26, shared a photo of herself for the first time since she was hospitalized following an overdose on July 24. \u201cI am so grateful to be home in time to vote!\u201d Lovato, who was raised in Texas, captioned the picture of her voting at a local polling place. \u201cOne vote can make a difference, so make sure your voice is heard! Now go out and #VOTE!\u201d\n\nPEOPLE confirmed on Sunday that Lovato was out of rehab after she was spotted outside of Matsuhisa restaurant in Los Angeles on Saturday evening with clothing designer Henry Levy.\n\nOn July 24, Lovato was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai in L.A. for 12 days following an overdose at her Hollywood Hills home, which is currently on the market for $8.995 million. She remained in the hospital for nearly two weeks before being released to seek in-patient treatment.\n\nThe former Disney Channel star first broke her silence on social media Aug. 5 when she shared an update on her health following her hospitalization. (The post has since been deleted.)\n\n\u201cI have always been transparent about my journey with addiction. What I\u2019ve learned is that this illness is not something that disappears or fades with time. It is something I must continue to overcome and have not done yet,\u201d Lovato wrote.\n\n\u201cI want to thank God for keeping me alive and well,\u201d she added, before praising her fans for standing by her through this difficult time.\n\n\u201cTo my fans, I am forever grateful for all of your love and support throughout this past week and beyond. Your positive thoughts and prayers have helped me navigate through this difficult time,\u201d she said.\n\nLovato concluded, \u201cI now need time to heal and focus on my sobriety and road to recovery. The love you have all shown me will never be forgotten and I look forward to the day where I can say I came out on the other side. I will keep fighting.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Demi Lovato\u2019s Mom Breaks Silence on Overdose: \u2018We Didn\u2019t Know If She Was Going to Make It\u2019\n\nThe star revealed she celebrated six years of sobriety in March \u2014 but just three months later, she opened up about a recent relapse when she released her autobiographical single \u201cSober\u201d on June 21.\n\nRecently, Lovato\u2019s mother, Dianna De La Garza, shared that her daughter has been sober for 90 days.\n\n\u201cYes, she has 90 days and I couldn\u2019t be more thankful or more proud of her because addiction being a disease, it\u2019s work,\u201d La Garza, 56, said during an October appearance on Maria Menounos\u2018 Sirius XM show.", "images":
