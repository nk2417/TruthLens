At the time, Patton wrote an obituary for The Times which read: \"Her family is devastated but can't help remember all of the times she made them laugh or comforted them, and they smile and laugh themselves. She hasn't left a void. She's left a blast crater\u2026 Five days after Michelle was gone, Alice and I were half-awake at dawn, after a night of half-sleeping. Alice sat up in bed. Her face was silhouetted in the dawn light of the bedroom windows. I couldn\u2019t see her expression. I just heard her voice: 'When your mum dies you're the best memory of her. Everything you do and say is a memory of her.' That's the kind of person Michelle created and helped shape.\"", "images": ["https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/845368d87d62-patton-oswalt-wife-t.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3f2f39507707-patton-oswalt-wife-a.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/845368d87d62-patton-oswalt-wife-t.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/02448e8e5a26-picture-with-celeb.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/55da45c5f11c-monac-day-gala-princess-charlene.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/7230546ce7a9-love-bombing.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/45c4ad90be7f-gettyimages-2247559458.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/9d33f6e7ada9-gettyimages-2179663411.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ef134fec4005-gettyimages-457526292.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b94b7ea33921-estee-lauder-sleep-collective.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/f33bc8908a94-gettyimages-2213486312.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b64f5d6d1251-emmy-griffiths-hello-magazine.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/845368d87d62-patton-oswalt-wife-t.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emmy Griffiths"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/brides/2017110643748/patton-oswalt-remarries-meredith-salenger/", "title": "Patton Oswalt remarries 18 months after first wife's sudden death", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "mrf": {"tags": "hasVideo:true", "sections": "brides"}, "title": "Patton Oswalt remarries 18 months after death of wife | HELLO!", "description": "Patton Oswalt has tied the knot with his partner Meredith Salenger!
