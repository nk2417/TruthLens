He was taken from the stage on a stretcher and the concert was canceled.\n\nAs seen in the video below from a concert attendee, Manson was performing and started to climb a giant set piece of two giant pistols. While doing so, the prop fell on him. Journalist Katerine Turman, who was also at the concert, tweeted that he was taken to the hospital and says that he only sustained a leg injury. Manson and his band launched his \u201cHeaven Upside Down\u201d tour just two days ago in Maryland. No word on additional details of his injury or whether or not this will affect the tour.\n\nManson rose to fame in the \u201990s as a shock rocker that combined macabre and glam rock. He turned to acting when he made his film debut David Lynch\u2019s 1997 film Lost Highway and had a small part in Jawbreaker. He went on to TV where he appeared in Californication and Eastbound and Down. Most recently he was part of the cast of WGN\u2019s Salem, and played a recurring character on Sons of Anarchy, and voiced The Shadow on ABC\u2019s Once Upon A Time.\n\nWatch on Deadline", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/marilyn-manson.jpg?w=1024", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/marilyn-manson.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/marilyn-manson.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dino-Ray Ramos", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2017/09/marilyn-manson-injured-concert-new-york-salem-sons-of-anarchy-1202180011/", "title": "Marilyn Manson Injured During Onstage Prop Accident At New York Concert", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Musician-actor Marilyn Manson was injured tonight during a concert at Hammerstein Ballroom in New York when a prop fell on him\u00a0while performing.
