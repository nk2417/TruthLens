The 13-year-old Stranger Things actress visited The Tonight Show on Tuesday to promote the Netflix show\u2019s second season.\n\nShe decided to recap the beloved series' first season in an epic rap.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to Indiana circa 1983, just four boys in the basement, chillin\u2019 playing D&D,\u201d she began, effortlessly rapping in her jumpsuit. \u201cThere was Lucas, there was Willy Will, and Dustin, there was Mike. But one night Will goes missing while he\u2019s riding on his bike. Yes, that\u2019s when they met me, Eleven. I had no hair on my head. I had been so close to dead.\u201d\n\nShe continued, finally referencing her character\u2019s signature traits, rapping, \u201cAll I need is my Eggo waffles, I\u2019m in love with those. What I\u2019m left with when I use my powers is a bloody nose.\u201d\n\nBrown later opened up about the fan reaction to the show, specifically people dressing as Eleven for Halloween.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t really think about it too much, because if I think about it, it freaks me out,\u201d she said. \u201cGrown men are dressing up like me. But I think it\u2019s cool. I\u2019m grateful for it.\u201d\n\nShe also gave host Jimmy Fallon a bit of a spoiler, saying that Mike and Eleven kiss again in the second season. Turns out, the moment wasn\u2019t exactly romantic when Brown was filming with her co-star Finn Wolfhard.\n\n\u201cHe was like, \u2018I\u2019m coming in,\u2019\u201d she said, miming Wolfhard\u2019s tight-lipped advance. \u201cAnd he was like a ventriloquist. It was the craziest thing.\u201d\n\nShe noted that whenever she hears the \u201880s song that was playing during the moment she gets \u201cgoosebumps.\u201d But when the audience \u201caww\u2019d\u201d over that statement she replied, \u201cNo! In disgust.\u201d\n\nBrown also gushed over her favorite TV family \u2013 the Kardashians.\n\n\u201cI love them, like, I really do. My mom, she\u2019s always like, \u2018I can\u2019t watch it,\u2019 but then she sits there and she\u2019s like\u2026,\u201d Brown said, miming her mom watching the show with her. \u201cI\u2019m obsessed with them. I follow them on social media. I think they\u2019re really great, they\u2019re so entertaining.\u201d\n\nAnd it turns out the feeling is mutual. Khloe Kardashian took to Twitter to obsess over the Netflix series.\n\nFor more Stranger Things fun, watch the clip below!", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-10/harbour_keery_instagram.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2017-11/jenna_dewan_tatum_channing_tatum_halloween2017.png?h=7dab519e&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/millie_bobby_brown_youtube.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/millie_bobby_brown_youtube.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-10/charlie_heaton_gettyimages-848068618.jpg?h=f4f43509&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/millie_bobby_brown_youtube.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/millie-bobby-brown-raps-stranger-things-season-1-recap-talks-kissing-her-co-star-watch-90237", "title": "Millie Bobby Brown Raps a \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Season 1 Recap, Talks Kissing Her Co-Star: Watch!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/millie_bobby_brown_youtube.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "She also gushed about her love for the Kardashians.", "title": "Millie Bobby Brown Raps a \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Season 1 Recap, Talks Kissing Her Co-Star: Watch!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/millie-bobby-brown-raps-stranger-things-season-1-recap-talks-kissing-her-co-star-watch-90237", "type": "Article"}, "description": "She also gushed about her love for the Kardashians.", "twitter": {"description": "She also gushed about her love for the Kardashians.", "title": "Millie Bobby Brown Raps a \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Season 1 Recap, Talks Kissing Her Co-Star: Watch!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/millie-bobby-brown-raps-stranger-things-season-1-recap-talks-kissing-her-co-star-watch-90237", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/millie_bobby_brown_youtube.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Millie Bobby Brown Raps a \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Season 1 Recap, Talks Kissing Her Co-Star: Watch! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Millie Bobby Brown, Stranger Things, The Tonight Show", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
