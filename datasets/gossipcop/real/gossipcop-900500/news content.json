The polymath has today announced The Hamildrops, a year-long program that will see new Hamilton content being released every month from now until December 2018. Kicking off the series is a previously unused, unrecorded song from the musical called \u201cBen Franklin\u2019s Song\u201d.\n\nMiranda apparently had intended to include the song as a solo introduction to Benjamin Franklin in Hamilton, but ended up cutting the character before ever composing the music. The lyrics, however, were written in the style of The Decemberists, so in 2016, he sent them to Colin Meloy to fully realize the song. The \u201creally swear-y\u201d song can be heard below.\n\n<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf</span>\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Video\n\nFans anticipating the promised Hamilton Mixtape 2 may be disappointed it will never come to light, but the Hamildrops should provide more than enough for Hamilfans to stay satiated.

below.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/941290378279510016\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/941290440426446848\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/941290644852572160\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/941290847785668608\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/941291086118621185\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/941291635090051072\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/941291788505141248\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/941291961192992768\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/941292039773278208\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/941292317360775168\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Lin_Manuel/status/941293702177349632\n\n\u201cBen
