She\u2019ll give you one sentence and there\u2019s no fat to it. You\u2019re like, \u2018You just chose such an unbelievable collection of words that beautifully articulate what you say.'\u201d\n\nAs for Slate, she has no regrets about their past.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not on bad terms, but we haven\u2019t really seen each other, spoken a lot. I think it\u2019s probably best,\u201d she shared with Vulture. \u201cI\u2019d love to be his friend one day, but we threw down pretty hard. No regrets, though.
