Drake will exec produce alongside his business partner, Adel \u201cFuture\u201d Nur, with Maverick Carter and Jamal Henderson for LeBron James\u2019 SpringHill Entertainment banner.\n\nThe third season picks up as Dushane (original star Ashley Walters) returns from exile to his home in London to reclaim his throne in the highly lucrative drug market. He teams with Sully (Kane \u201cKano\u201d Robinson), his spiritual brother, partner, and sometime rival who is also returning to the same streets after his own form of exile \u2014 prison \u2014 comes to an end. Awaiting them both is Jamie, the young, hungry and ruthless gang leader whose ambitions leave no place for Dushane and Sully.\n\nIn THR\u2018s cover story, Drake noted he caught the original on YouTube and was taken with its depiction of London as both beautiful and malevolent. \u201cThat human element drew me in,\u201d he said. Netflix vp originals Cindy Holland also noted that it was Drake\u2019s passion for the series that \u201cdrove its resurrection.\u201d\n\nTop Boy comes as Drake is looking to expand his television (and film) footprint. While details remain slim, Drake is said to be teaming with A24 (Moonlight) in a deal that includes both TV and film; with Anonymous Content (Mr. Robot) for an untitled TV series; and potentially something with Apple, too. Drake is currently producing documentary feature The Carter Effect, about former NBA star Vince Carter, that premiered at the Toronto Film Festival.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/top_boy_trailer_and_drake_-_inset_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/top_boy_trailer_and_drake_-_inset_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Goldberg", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/drake-revives-british-drama-top-boy-as-netflix-original-series-1055740/", "title": "Drake Revives British Drama \u2018Top Boy\u2019 as Netflix Original Series (Exclusive)", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "LeBron James' SpringHill Entertainment will also executive produce the show, which will bow in 2019.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Lesley Goldberg", "tags": "autoplay, Drake, Netflix", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Drake Revives British Drama \u2018Top Boy\u2019 as Netflix Original Series (Exclusive)", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/drake-revives-british-drama-top-boy-as-netflix-original-series-1055740/", "description": "LeBron James' SpringHill Entertainment will also executive produce the show, which will bow in 2019.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/top_boy_trailer_and_drake_-_inset_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Drake Revives British Drama 'Top Boy' Netflix Original Series (Exclusive)"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-08T06:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-29T06:00:15+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "LeBron James' SpringHill Entertainment will also executive produce the show, which will bow in 2019.", "site": "@thr", "creator": "@snoodit", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Drake Revives British Drama \u2018Top Boy\u2019 as Netflix Original Series (Exclusive)", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/top_boy_trailer_and_drake_-_inset_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510120800.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
