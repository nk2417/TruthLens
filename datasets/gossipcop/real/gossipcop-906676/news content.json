Ashley Graham is making a colorful splash in the latest issue of V Magazine in a pop art-inspired photo spread shot by Ben Hassett and styled by Anna Trevelyan.\n\nThe model shows off no shortage of color thanks to bold and fierce makeup by Maybelline\u2019s global makeup artist Erin Parsons, and poses with standout accessories including a Fendi logo purse, Louis Vuitton earrings, and a \u201cMonet\u201d Jeff Koons x Louis Vuitton collaboration bag.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the model\u2019s gone topless for V. The beauty posed nude last May for a black-and-white photo shoot with Mario Sorrenti and corresponding interview with Tracee Ellis Ross.\n\nThis shoot, entitled \u201cAshley Graham Shows Her Colors,\u201d was all about individuality, with Graham telling the book, \u201cIndividuality means feeling comfortable enough to be your authentic self. I hope we continue having progressive conversations about inclusion and equality, and that the next generations sees themselves represented more diversely in the media!\u201d\n\nIt looks like Graham is a fan of the images\u2014she shared them on her Instagram this morning.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/949f3c7ba688c310de150a933acd7aba108de5144552942a03149e3a35f63d62?s=100&d=mm&r=g", "https://fashionweekdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-17-at-11.59.41-AM.jpg", "https://fashionweekdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-17-at-11.59.41-AM-802x1083.jpg", "https://fashionweekdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-17-at-11.59.27-AM.jpg", "https://fashionweekdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Website_Daily_Logo_3D.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20340%20378'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://fashionweekdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/editors-pick.jpg", "https://fashionweekdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-17-at-11.59.51-AM.jpg", "https://fashionweekdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-17-at-11.59.35-AM.jpg", "https://fashionweekdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/fla-highlights-Hailey-Bieber-Chappell-Roan.jpg", "https://fashionweekdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/DFR_logo_footer.png", "https://fashionweekdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/logo_daily.jpg", "https://fashionweekdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ashley6.jpg", "https://fashionweekdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/DFR_September_2025_cover_sidebar.jpg"], "top_img": "https://fashionweekdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-17-at-11.59.41-AM.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sydney Sadick"], "canonical_link": "https://fashionweekdaily.com/ashley-graham-topless-photo-shoot-v-magazine/", "title": "Ashley Graham Goes Topless For V Magazine", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "twitter": {"label1": "Written by", "data1": "Sydney Sadick", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute", "title": "Ashley Graham Goes Topless For V Magazine - Daily Front Row", "url": "https://fashionweekdaily.com/ashley-graham-topless-photo-shoot-v-magazine/", "description": "She's bright, she's beautiful, and she's...topless!\u00a0Ashley Graham is making a colorful splash in the latest issue of\u00a0V Magazine in a pop art-inspired photo spread shot by\u00a0Ben Hassett and styled by\u00a0Anna Trevelyan.
