{"url": "http://screencrush.com/bad-moms-christmas-trailer/", "text": "We hold these truths to be self-evident: that in the film A Bad Moms Christmas, there will be moms, they will be bad, and it will be Christmas. The sequel to 2016\u2019s sleeper hit has now gotten its first trailer, and if nothing else, I can confirm for you beyond any shadow of a doubt that A Bad Moms Christmas will star a collection of moms, all of whom will indulge in varying levels of badness. This year, the reason for the season is mom-ing, and doing it badly.\n\nThe new red-band spot \u2014 which is NSFW only in the naughty language way, not in the exposed body parts way \u2014 rejoins our gals Amy (Mila Kunis), Kiki (Kristen Bell), and Carla (Kathryn Hahn) as the Yuletide season launches them all into crisis mode. As if buying gifts, decorating the house, cleaning, wrapping, cooking, and dealing with a sudden influx of pubic hair in need of waxing wasn\u2019t stressful enough, the women blow a collective gasket when their mothers come to town. Susan Sarandon, Cheryl Hines and Christine Baranski all join the cast as the bad moms\u2019 worse moms, shrewdly judging their daughters for failing to fulfill the dusty old conceptions of what a woman should be.\n\nBut because this is A Bad Moms Christmas and not Shamed Into Being a Good Moms Christmas, the women will reclaim their independence and throw off the shackles of domesticity. Mostly, that means getting wasted and twerking on Santa. A sentimental family christmas, just like Norman Rockwell always imagined it! (But with a little girl who won\u2019t stop deploying F-bombs.)", "images": ["http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2021/03/wandavision-secret-bad-guy-who-is-it.jpeg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2022/07/attachment-GettyImages-1410928435.jpg?w=980&q=75", "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2017/06/636340952354721518-ABMC-Unit-03257CR-e1498660706991.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2021/12/attachment-attachment-Actors-Who-Lied-For-Roles.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2020/11/wandavision-4.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2024/07/attachment-agatha-all-along.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2021/02/agatha-wanda.jpeg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2023/06/attachment-nude-scene-body-doubles.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2022/11/attachment-KO2_20210629_02447r_f.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2018/04/screencrush-high-rez.png"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2017/06/636340952354721518-ABMC-Unit-03257CR-e1498660706991.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Charles Bramesco"], "canonical_link": "https://screencrush.com/bad-moms-christmas-trailer/", "title": "Yuletide Chaos Reigns in the NSFW \u2018A Bad Moms Christmas\u2019 Trailer", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "screencrush", "description": "The red-band trailer for \u2018A Bad Moms Christmas\u2019 sees the moms cutting loose with Santa Claus and facing their own bad moms.", "keywords": "bad moms christmas movie trailer, bad moms christmas red band trailer, bad moms christmas mila kunis, bad moms christmas trailer kristen bell, bad moms 2,,movie news,trailers", "fb": {"app_id": 856098531951831, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "false", "admins": 100002025987268, "pages": 335338213173624}, "og": {"title": "Yuletide Chaos Reigns in the NSFW \u2018A Bad Moms Christmas\u2019 Trailer", "description": "The red-band trailer for \u2018A Bad Moms Christmas\u2019 sees the moms cutting loose with Santa Claus and facing their own bad moms.", "url": "https://screencrush.com/bad-moms-christmas-trailer/", "site_name": "ScreenCrush", "type": "article", "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2017/06/636340952354721518-ABMC-Unit-03257CR-e1498660706991.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@screencrushnews"}, "sailthru.description": "The red-band trailer for \u2018A Bad Moms Christmas\u2019 sees the moms cutting loose with Santa Claus and facing their own bad moms.", "sailthru.date": "2017-06-28 11:00:49", "sailthru.title": "The Moms Are Still Bad (Plus It\u2019s Christmas!) in the \u2018A Bad Moms Christmas\u2019 Trailer", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-screencrush, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, a-bad-moms-christmas, kathryn-hahn, kristen-bell, mila-kunis, susan-sarandon, movie-news, trailers", "sailthru.author": "charlesbramesco", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2017/06/636340952354721518-ABMC-Unit-03257CR-e1498660706991.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2017/06/636340952354721518-ABMC-Unit-03257CR-e1498660706991.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "ad": {"primis": {"id": 113734}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498662049.0, "source": "http://screencrush.com", "summary": ""}
