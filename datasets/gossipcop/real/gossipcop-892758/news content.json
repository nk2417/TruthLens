{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_(Ed_Sheeran_song)", "text": "2017 single by Ed Sheeran\n\n\"Perfect\" is a song by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran from his third studio album, \u00f7 (2017).[1] After the album's release, it charted at number four on the UK Singles Chart.[2] On 21 August 2017, Billboard announced that \"Perfect\" would be the fourth single from the album.[3] The song was serviced to pop radio on 26 September 2017 as the third single from the album in the United States (fourth overall).[4] The second version of the single, titled \"Perfect Duet\", with American singer Beyonc\u00e9, was released on 1 December 2017.[5] Another duet with Italian singer Andrea Bocelli, titled \"Perfect Symphony\", was released on 15 December 2017.[6]\n\nOriginally peaking at number four in March 2017, the song re-entered the UK Singles Chart later that year. After the publication of \"Duet\" version the song reached number one on the UK Chart in December 2017. For the high sales of its version compared to the original one, Beyonc\u00e9 was credited on several official sales charts, becoming her sixth Billboard Hot 100 number one song and Sheeran's second. The song also peaked at number one in 26 other countries, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and many European and Latin American countries.\n\nThe original song's official music video received three nominations at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nComposition and production [ edit ]\n\n\"Perfect\" was the first track Sheeran wrote for his third studio album \u00f7.[7]\n\nThe song is a romantic ballad focusing on traditional marriage, written about his wife-to-be Cherry Seaborn, whom he knew from school and then reconnected with when she was working in New York.[8][9] Sheeran revealed that the inspiration for the lyrics came after visiting James Blunt's house in Ibiza, where the two singers had listened to the rapper Future's music at six in the morning.[10] He said: \"Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song, which happened to be Future's 'March Madness'... I booked the studio for the day, and I had that and I was like, right, let me just flesh that out. And the song happened and was sort of finished that day. I knew it was special.\"[10][11]\n\nSheeran produced the song himself with help from Will Hicks. It was recorded with strings orchestration from his brother Matthew Sheeran.[10] This is the first time the brothers had collaborated on a song, as it was a suggestion from their grandmother to see the brothers working together shortly before she died. The full string orchestration was later used for the recording with Andrea Bocelli.[12] Another version with slightly different lyrics featuring Camila Cabello and Nicholas Galitzine is included in the Cinderella (2021 soundtrack).\n\nThe song is written in the key of A\u266d major (G major in live performances) with a tempo of 95 beats per minute in 12\n\n8 time (if not using triplets) or 4\n\n4 time (if using triplets). \"Perfect\" moves at a chord progression of A\u266d5\u2013Fm7\u2013D\u266dsus2\u2013E\u266d. The vocals span from E\u266d 3 to A\u266d 4 in the song.[13]\n\nIn September 2023, when asked by a journalist which of his songs he thought would become his \"Yesterday\" (i.e., the song that \"would define his oeuvre\"), Sheeran replied, \"Perfect\".[14]\n\nCommercial performance [ edit ]\n\nUnited Kingdom [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2017, Sheeran broke the record set by Frankie Laine in 1953, occupying all of the top five positions in the United Kingdom, and placing nine songs in the top ten of the UK Singles Chart.[15] Also, every single one of the sixteen tracks from his new album \u00f7 entered the top twenty. \"Perfect\" peaked at number four and the song debuted at that position, selling 62,599 copies.[15] After Sheeran's performance of \"Perfect\" on The X Factor on 26 November 2017, the song reached a new peak in the UK, advancing to number three and selling 32,507 units.[16] The Beyonc\u00e9 version, released on 1 December 2017, drove consumption of the track to 89,359 sales (including 45,460 from sales-equivalent streams) as it became Sheeran's second number-one song from \u00f7, following \"Shape of You\" \u2013 and his fourth number-one single in total.[17]\n\nWith UK sales of 1,048,313, \"Perfect\" became Sheeran's tenth million-selling single.[17] It became 2017's Christmas number one single on 22 December 2017.[18] It beat the likes of Wham!, Eminem ft.

Kirsty MacColl, Rita Ora and Mariah Carey to the Christmas number one spot and held the summit for six consecutive weeks before being displaced by Eminem's \"River\", which features Sheeran as a guest artist.[19] It was formerly the song with the most weeks on the UK top 75.
