For someone who is virtually inactive on the app, I don't need his follow- my eyes are tattooed to his chest.\"\n\n\"The energy you put into this does not serve you our your life in any way kids\u2026. truly 'beating a dead horse.' You guys can call it promo but I just post about my boyfriend like anyone else, whether I support z or he supports me is out of love and excitement for one another. There's nothing to figure out all the time\u2026 give it a break. This is my last comment on this matter but I hope u know it's not coming from a bad place. Just would love for you to find something else that inspires you in life\u2026. x.\"\n\nGigi also responded to a fan who said she should have DM'd the account:\n\n\"I see your point that it should have been a direct message, and I agree- just didn't think of it. This is all just very frustrating and I'm only human ... I've seen the s--t on this account for just as long as u- and have too stand quiet. - I've just had enough.. just because I'm 'a celebrity' doesn't mean I don't feel, or that my time is too precious to not listen to what people have to say. I'm sure you can see how assumptions like this can be hurtful, especially about someone I love deeply- if you guys love him too, sooner or later you'll realise we're on the same team. ;)\"\n\n26 July 2018 - Yolanda Hadid shares an Instagram Story hanging out with Zayn. In with the fam, eh?\n\n\n\nInstagram Stories/Yolanda Hadid\n\n14 August 2018 - Gigi shares first proper selfie with Zayn since their romantic reconciliation, posting to Instagram Stories with the caption, \"Goodbye vacay we thank you\". Selfies mean it's serious, right?\n\nInstagram Stories/Gigi Hadid\n\n24 August 2018 - Yolanda Hadid posts this adorable photo of her daughter and Zayn celebrating Eid together.\n\nInstagram\n\n22 October 2018: Gigi and Zayn's relationship might've just gone through a rocky patch after the pair embarked on a bit of a break, but it looks like they've come out of the other side now, after Gigi shared a cute snap of the pair on Instagram.\n\n\"flyin[g] home to my happy place \u2764\ufe0f\" she wrote, alongside a candid shot of a topless Zayn hugging her from behind. Cute!\n\nDecember 12, 2018 - Zayn releases the track 'There You Are' an intense love song about relying on people that fans definitely think is about Gigi Hadid. Lyrics include, \"Friends that I rely on/Don't come through/They run like the river/But not you.\n\n\"Only you know me the way you know me / Only you forgive me when I'm sorry / Even when I messed it up / There you are.\"\n\nThis could refer to Zayn and Gigi's on-again-off-again relationship, or the fact the couple have previously touched on tough times in their relationship, which are ultimately resolved.\n\nJanuary 3rd 2019 - Have Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid split?! The pair have reportedly been spending time apart 'since early November', with an insider saying it was for the sake of their future.\n\nAccording to a source at E! News, the singer, 25, and the model, 23, both \"think that time apart is best for the sake of their relationship right now. Both have been really focused on themselves and their separate careers.\n\n\"Zayn has been in the studio recording new music and pushing out his new album, while Gigi has been focusing a lot of time on herself.\"\n\nMarch 4th 2019 - Zayn Malik tweets about his love for Gigi Hadid, and fans are confused. While neither party have commented on the split claims so far, they also haven't been spotted together in public this year, so fans assumed they had broken up.\n\nThat is until Zayn tweeted Gigi [3 March] saying \"@GiGiHadid love you.\" Some outlets are reporting the singer deleted the tweet before Gigi had a chance to respond, but it is seemingly still live on the site:\n\nMarch 29th 2019 - A new report claims that despite Gigi Hadid still having love for Zayn Malik, they are currently not together, and haven't been since January.\n\n\"She still has feelings for him, of course, but he has major issues and she knows they aren\u2019t compatible. She\u2019s still very single\" said an Us Weekly insider, before adding that \"Gigi and Zayn still talk.\"\n\nApril 5th 2019 - Zayn Malik says Gigi Hadid is the \"most amazing woman I have ever met\" as he defends her against Twitter trolls, following a tweet from him which many assumed was about her.\n\nLet's rewind for a second. So Gigi was spotted out with her friend Samuel Krost, and many paparazzi agencies immediately referred to him as her \"mystery man\". Gigi then took to Twitter to shut down any romance rumours, writing, \"If you outlets are going to continue writing bs headlines every time I\u2019m seen with a friend of the male gender then there\u2019s going to be a lot of unneeded confusion \ud83d\ude43\ud83d\ude11\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f [sic]\"\n\nLater, Zayn tweeted, \"To any dumb f*** out there that wants to make their own stories up\", which many assumed was fighting Gigi's corner about the photos.\n\nThe singer later took to Twitter again, though, to not only deny his original tweet was about his ex-girlfriend, but to shut down any trolls who were attacking the model on social media. He wrote:\n\n\"My tweet was not about @GiGiHadid so leave her the f*** alone she is the most amazing woman I\u2019ve ever known / And does nothing but love and support me when lord knows I don\u2019t deserve it / So if you have anything to say @ me and I\u2019ll put you the f*** straight / If you know nothing shut your fucking mouth.\"\n\nWe're as confused as you are about what's going on, but one thing is for sure: Zayn is still full of love for Gigi.\n\nNovember 20th 2019 - Zayn and Gigi reportedly start talking again 10 months after their split. However, anyone who wants to see them back together in a romantic way is set to be disappointed, as sources say it's purely just friendly.\n\nThe model is believed to have reached out to the former 1D singer after she split from Bachelorette star Tyler Cameron.\n\n\"Gigi has always had a soft spot for Zayn and they have a lot of history together. They are definitely not getting back together but are on good terms right now,\" a source spilled.\n\nThey added to E! News: \"They went through a phase where they took time apart and weren't communicating at all, but they have been in touch recently. She is supportive of him. They chat here and there but it's been casual.\"\n\nFebruary 14th 2020 - Gigi Hadid basically confirmed that she and Zayn Malik are back together, after sharing a picture of him on Instagram for Valentine's Day. While the pair had been spotted out together earlier this year, this is the first time Gigi has spoken out about them being back on.\n\n\n\nRumours had been circulating since late 2019 that the couple had rekindled their romance, and we reckon this Valentine's Day ode is pretty conclusive evidence that they have.\n\nPosting a picture on her second Instagram account, gisposable, Gigi shared a snap of Zayn out in the countryside, captioning the pic, \"HEY VALENTINE. Z on the farm \u2661 Dec 2019.\"\n\nGigi then reposted the picture from her gisposable account, where she shares personal pictures taken on disposable film, on her main Instagram story, adding a cute loveheart gif. Her main account, gigihadid, has 51.7 million followers, so if there's one way to declare your love for someone, that's just about as public as you can get.\n\nThe cute photo of Zayn is thought to have been take on Gigi's mum's farm in Pennsylvania, where the couple spend time privately.\n\nZayn and Gigi were rumoured to have started speaking again back in November 2019 after Gigi split from Bachelorette star Tyler Cameron. But it wasn't until January 2020 that the couple were photographed out together in New York. If Gigi's newest post is anything to go by, it looks like they could have been back together as early as December 2019.\n\nWhy do you keep these things from us, Gigi?!\n\nApril 26th 2020 - After Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik officially got back together earlier this year, it seems like they're now in lockdown together, with Gigi sharing pics of the pair celebrating her 25th birthday. Gigi and Zayn are usually pretty private but Gigi made the exception for her bday, posting pics of her family's celebrations.\n\n\n\nPosing with some \"25\" balloons on her front porch, Gigi shared an Instagram pic of her hugging Zayn, showing only the back of his head and leaving fans wondering if it was even him. However, all became clear when she followed up with a second Insta. In a boomerang post, Gigi, her sister Bella Hadid and Zayn can be seen cuddling up together with balloons for Gigi's birthday, and we love to see them together as a happy family.\n\nGigi added the caption, \"Had the sweetest day celebrating my 25th birthday with my quarantine family, who made it so special for me, along with all the love I felt from all over the world!\n\nShe continued, \"I am grateful and lucky that my family and friends -near and far- are healthy and safe, and although I missed loved ones I wish I could have celebrated with, know that these times will make us even more grateful for togetherness to be had in the future! I will never forget my 25th bday!\"\n\nIt seems like Gigi's family are 100% on board with her and Zayn's rekindled romance, with Gigi's dad, Mohamed Hadid, commenting, \"Coolest crowd.\" Honestly, we couldn't agree more.\n\nApril 28, 2020 - Omg! Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid are reportedly expecting their first child, and the 25 year old is pregnant! According to TMZ, family sources say Gigi is apparently already 20 weeks, and there has been no word on whether or not the baby is a girl or a boy, though the couple may not yet know.\n\nApril 29, 2020 - After it was reported by TMZ that Gigi and Zayn are expecting their first child together, new Us Weekly sources disclosed that the model has always dreamed about having children with the singer. The source revealed, \"She\u2019s always wanted to start a family with Zayn\" and they're both \"so in love.\"\n\nAhh we're so happy for them!\n\nJune 5th 2020 - Zayn and Gigi shared a rare selfie of the two of them together, two months after announcing that they're expecting their first child.\n\nGigi and Zayn barely ever take pics together, so this one was a real treat. The new photo showed Gigi taking a mirror selfie, while a mysterious man has his arm around her waist - but, let's be honest, we can tell that it's Zayn a mile off. Honestly, these two don't even need a professional photographer to look amazing.\n\nThe rare photo of the couple came as part of British Vogue's campaign to raise money for NHS Charities Together and the NAACP, with celebs donating their clothes to British Vogue's 'Hardly Ever Worn It' auction. To be honest, anything worn by Zigi we'd part with our cash for.\n\nThe pics also appeared in the July issue of British Vogue with limited edition prints available to buy - if you want Zayn and Gigi permanently swooning down at you, that is.\n\nAugust 2020 - Gigi shows off her gorgeous baby bump on Instagram, looking like a real like angel.\n\nSeptember 2020 - Surprise! Gigi and Zayn have welcomed a baby girl! The pair made the announcement with some adorable photos on Instagram.\n\nZayn wrote, \"Our baby girl is here, healthy and beautiful. To try put into words how I am feeling right now would be an impossible task. The love I feel for this tiny human is beyond my understanding. Grateful to know her, proud to call her mine, and thankful for the life we will have together x\".\n\nGigi added the caption, \"Our girl joined us earth-side this weekend and she\u2019s already changed our world. So in love.\"\n\nSO cute. Can't wait to see what she looks like.\n\n28 September 2020 - New details about Gigi Hadid giving birth and welcoming her first child with Zayn Malik have emerged. According to Page Six, the 25-year-old gave birth at the New Hope farmhouse in Pennsylvania.\n\nAccording to reports, the pair 'had been isolating on the farm since May', which neighbours Gigi's mum Yolanda's $4M, 32-acre farm nearby. Speaking about their farmhouse, Zayn told Billboard back in 2017, \"There's not a lot of things around. I do a lot of farm work. I take the horses out and feed the cows and that kind of stuff. It's cool. I've always been interested in animals.\" So wholesome!\n\nOctober 4th, 2020: While Gigi and Zayn have been keeping a low-profile since the birth of their little girl, insiders in the US have revealed that the model is \"elated\" to be a mum. \"Gigi is very tired but is already an amazing mum,\" they spilled to E! News. \"The first couple of weeks have been a hard transition but she hasn't complained and is very elated to be a mum.\"\n\nThey added that the couple will be staying at their farm in Pennsylvania, where Gigi gave birth, for the 'foreseeable future'.\n\n\"They feel peaceful staying there for now.
