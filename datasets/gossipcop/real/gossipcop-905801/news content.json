We stand by the meticulous reporting of Ms. Orth.\u201d\n\nIn Murphy\u2019s follow-up cycle to The People v. O.J. Simpson, Edgar Ramirez stars as Versace, while Penelope Cruz stars as his sister Donatella, Ricky Martin plays his longtime partner Antonio D\u2019Amico and Darren Criss stars as Cunanan.\n\nMurphy himself told The Hollywood Reporter that Donatella Versace\u2019s actions seemed to indicate she wasn\u2019t entirely displeased with the drama. \u201cDonatella Versace sent Penelope Cruz a very large arrangement of flowers when she was representing the show at the Golden Globes,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she is going to watch the show, but if she did, I think she would see that we treat her and her family with respect and kindness, and she really is sort of a feminist role model in my book because she had to step into an impossible situation, which she did with grace and understanding.\u201d\n\nUltimately, Murphy said he understands the instinct to be wary of the project but added that Cruz \u201cwould never do anything to represent [Donatella] in a negative light.\u201d\n\nThe Versace family has noted that it will issue no further comment on the show.\n\nreally loves Penelope [Cruz] and knows that Penelope would never do anything to represent her in a negative light,\u201d the series creator said Monday night at the premiere of \u2018The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.'\u201d]\n\nRead the family\u2019s statement in full below:\n\nAs we have said, the Versace family has neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever in the forthcoming TV series about the death of Mr. Gianni Versace, which should only be considered as a work of fiction.\n\nThe company producing the series claims it is relying on a book by Maureen Orth, but the Orth book itself is full of gossip and speculation. Orth never received any information from the Versace family and she has no basis to make claims about the intimate personal life of Gianni Versace or other family members. Instead, in her effort to create a sensational story, she presents second-hand hearsay that is full of contradictions.\n\nAs just one example, Orth makes assertions about Gianni Versace\u2019s medical condition based on a person who claims he reviewed a post-mortem test result, but she admits it would have been illegal for the person to have reviewed the report in the first place (if it existed at all). In making her lurid claims, she ignores contrary information provided by members of Mr. Versace\u2019s family, who lived and worked closely with him and were in the best position to know the facts of his life.\n\nGianni Versace was a brave and honest man, who engaged in humanitarian work for the benefit of others. Of all the possible portrayals of his life and legacy, it is sad and reprehensible that the producers have chosen to present the distorted and bogus version created by Maureen Orth.\n\nThe Versace family will issue no further comment on the matter.\n\nUPDATE: On Thursday, Random House (publisher of source material Vulgar Favors by journalist Maureen Orth, issued its own statement on the matter: \u201cFirst published almost 19 years ago, Vulgar Favors is a carefully reported and extensively-sourced work of investigative journalism by an award-winning journalist with impeccable credentials. The book has stood the test of time and is widely regarded as the definitive account of Andrew Cunanan\u2019s chilling crime spree. Random House stands by the book and its author, Maureen Orth.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/acsversace-ep301_scday-r1e-embed.jpg?w=928&h=619&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/acsversace-ep301_scday-r1e-embed.jpg?w=928&h=619&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Reed", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/versace-issues-statement-american-crime-story-pokes-holes-shows-credibility-1073580/", "title": "Versace Issues Another Statement About \u2018American Crime Story,\u2019 Pokes Holes in Show\u2019s Credibility", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "&quot;As we have said, the Versace family has neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever in the forthcoming TV series about the death of Mr.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Sam Reed", "tags": "FX, Ryan Murphy, Style News, The Assassination of Gianni Versace, The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, Versace", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Versace Issues Another Statement About \u2018American Crime Story,\u2019 Pokes Holes in Show\u2019s Credibility", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/versace-issues-statement-american-crime-story-pokes-holes-shows-credibility-1073580/", "description": "\"As we have said, the Versace family has neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever in the forthcoming TV series about the death of Mr. Gianni Versace, which should only be considered as a work of fiction.\"", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/acsversace-ep301_scday-r1e-embed.jpg?w=928&h=619&crop=1", "width": 928, "height": 619, "alt": "Versace Issues Another Statement About 'American Crime Story,' Pokes Holes Show's Credibility"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-10T09:26:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-17T21:11:11+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"As we have said, the Versace family has neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever in the forthcoming TV series about the death of Mr. Gianni Versace, which should only be considered as a work of fiction.\"", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Versace Issues Another Statement About \u2018American Crime Story,\u2019 Pokes Holes in Show\u2019s Credibility", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/acsversace-ep301_scday-r1e-embed.jpg?w=928&h=619&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515576408.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
