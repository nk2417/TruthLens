Others speculated that if the maid of honor title didn\u2019t fall on Kate Middleton, it would have gone to Markle\u2019s friend Jessica Mulroney. According to Vanity Fair, Mulroney is Meghan Markle\u2019s \u201csecret wedding planner\u201d and one of her best friends.\n\nAlthough Markle will not have a Maid of Honor, Prince William and Kate Middleton\u2019s children Prince George and Princess Charlotte are expected to have official roles during the ceremony. George and Charlotte were a page boy and bridesmaid at Aunt Pippa Middleton\u2019s wedding in 2017. Newborn royal baby Prince Louis Arthur Charles is probably too young to be a page boy.\n\nOn April 26, Kensington Palace announced that Prince William will serve as Prince Harry\u2019s Best Man, just like the Harry did for his brother\u2019s wedding in 2011.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180505171338im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180505171338im_/http://assets.time.com/images/idealmedia.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180505171338im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/meghan-markle-royal-wedding-maid-of-honor.jpg?quality=85", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180505171338im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180505171338im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180505171338im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180505171338im_/http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180505171338im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/meghan-markle-royal-wedding-maid-of-honor.jpg?quality=85", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lena Grossman"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180505171338/http://time.com/5265722/meghan-markle-maid-of-honor-royal-wedding/", "title": "Meghan Markle Won't Have a Maid of Honor at Royal Wedding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "who is meghan markle maid of honor, royal wedding party, meghan markle maid of honor, meghan markle wedding party, royal wedding party, prince harry wedding party, royal wedding maid of honor, royal wedding bridesmaid", "news_keywords": "who is meghan markle maid of honor, royal wedding party, meghan markle maid of honor, meghan markle wedding party, royal wedding party, prince harry wedding party, royal wedding maid of honor, royal wedding bridesmaid", "description": "Kensington Palace announced that Meghan Markle won't have a maid of honor at her wedding to Prince Harry on May 19.", "og": {"title": "Why Meghan Markle Won't Have a Maid of Honor at Her Wedding", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180505171338/http://time.com/5265722/meghan-markle-maid-of-honor-royal-wedding/", "description": "It's a very diplomatic reason", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180505171338im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/meghan-markle-royal-wedding-maid-of-honor.jpg?quality=85", "width": 1024, "height": 719}}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://time.com/5265722/meghan-markle-maid-of-honor-royal-wedding/", "description": "Kensington Palace announced that Meghan Markle won't have a maid of honor at her wedding to Prince Harry on May 19.", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/meghan-markle-royal-wedding-maid-of-honor.jpg?quality=85"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180505171338im_/http://time.com/5265722/meghan-markle-maid-of-honor-royal-wedding/", "title": "Why Meghan Markle Won't Have a Maid of Honor at Her Wedding", "description": "It's a very diplomatic reason", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180505171338im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/meghan-markle-royal-wedding-maid-of-honor.jpg?quality=85"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
