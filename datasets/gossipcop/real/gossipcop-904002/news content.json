It\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that the 35-year-old sisters are the most famous twins in the world right now. (Don\u2019t tell the Olsens.)\n\n\n\nBrie Bella at Cosmopolitan.com HQ. Photo by Ruben Chamorro.\n\nThey\u2019re so well-known they go by just Nikki and Brie, AKA the Bella Twins, World Wrestling Entertainment superstars whose superstardom has transcended the ring and turned into measurable mainstream success. See: nearly 20 million combined followers across Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram; almost 1 million viewers per episode of their E! reality series; and a reported combined net worth of roughly $10 million.\n\n\n\n(Oh, and for the record: the Rack Attack 2.0 is Nikki\u2019s signature \u201cfinisher\u201d move in which she slings her opponent over her shoulders like it\u2019s nothing and then drops her down so she lands hard onto the ring floor, boobs first. Do not attempt this at home.)\n\n\n\nChances are, you\u2019ve seen them on TV, in the middle of an arena, under the glow of stoplight red-colored lights\u2014Nikki probably sporting a bright red bra top with the words \u201cFearless Nikki\u201d emblazoned across the front and Brie in a black crop top reading \u201cBRIE MODE\u201d\u2014sharing a mischievous grin before simultaneously flipping over the top rope, their Kardashian-length hair trailing behind them.\n\nJohn Francis/Instagram.\n\nNo? Then you\u2019ve probably caught an episode of the popular E! reality show Total Divas, which follows the professional and personal lives of the twins and the other wrestlers in the Women's Division of WWE. (The series just returned for its eighth season last month, currently ranking as one of Wednesday night\u2019s top ten original primetime programs for women ages 18-34, per E!.) Or maybe it was an episode of the network\u2019s hit spinoff series, Total Bellas, which also ranks among the top ten primetime cable programs for women ages 18-49, according to the network, and is filming its fourth season now.\n\nNikki Bella at Cosmopolitan.com HQ. Photo by Ruben Chamorro.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ve sipped their Belle Radici wine\u2014the first run sold out in 36 hours. Or maybe you considered ordering one of the good-vibes-infused graphic tees from their women\u2019s empowerment-inspired clothing brand, Birdiebee. Or cooed over home videos of Birdie, Brie\u2019s adorbs 16-month-old daughter with husband and fellow professional wrestler Bryan Danielson, on the twins\u2019 very popular YouTube channel.)\n\nAt the very least, in the last year\u2014arguably Nikki and Brie\u2019s biggest, most dramatic year yet\u2014you\u2019ve seen them making the morning-show rounds, sitting on late-night couches, and splashed across tabloid covers breathlessly reporting on the details of the drawn-out public split between Nikki and WWE superstar John Cena. (More on that later.)\n\n\n\nAnd after an over three-year hiatus from wrestling together, the Bellas are back in the ring following a scary, sidelining neck injury (Nikki) and a baby (Brie). They made their triumphant return a few weeks ago, just in time to be part of WWE history, headlining high-profile all-women matches they themselves inspired the network to air. (More on that later, too.)\n\nWhich is why they\u2019re at the Cosmopolitan.com office on the gray, muggy Monday morning after the annual pay-per-view WWE event known as SummerSlam. In the ring, Nikki and Brie play ass-kicking Mean Girls. IRL, they\u2019re more like the pretty, popular girl who\u2019s actually really, really nice.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s part of the appeal\u2014they\u2019re remarkably down-to-earth for a set of famous identical-looking babes. As the elevator door opens into the Cosmopolitan.com office, they\u2019re all smiles, chill vibes, and eye contact. Before they start playing dress-up, forgoing the rack of Dancing with the Stars-esque sexy sequined dresses you might expect them to choose and instead gushing over the cooler, sleeker fashion-fashion looks, Nikki is low-key in a black tank and black leggings and a flannel buttoned-down. Brie is in a blush-colored flowy top and flared, wide-legged light blue jeans. Even their coffee orders are unfussy: just black, with some cinnamon if you have it.\n\nAt lunch a few hours later, over bowls of sea salt-dusted edamame and blistered shishito peppers, Nikki and Brie seem wholly unaffected by the fact that everyone else around us is literally staring at them. It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re charmingly oblivious to the whole being-famous thing. Except that they\u2019ve been preparing for this moment their entire lives.\n\nEven as kids, when they were still the Garcia twins, the sisters sought out the spotlight, putting on karaoke performances at home for their parents\u2019 unwitting friends during pay-per-view fight nights. \u201cWhen there was an intermission, we would ask if we could lip sync and dance to the Spice Girls,\u201d Brie recalls. \u201cAnd my parents were always like, \u2018OK?\u2019 I look back\u2014my parents had to watch these young girls go, \u2018Tell me what you want, what you really, really want\u2019 to like all of their drunk friends\u2014and I'm like, How were we not embarrassed?\"\n\nTheir mom, Kathy Colace Laurinaitis, a managing partner at a national recruiting firm in Phoenix, Arizona, recalls how even as babies \u201cthey've loved entertaining people.\u201d \u201cI remember this time they were in a shopping cart in Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us and they weren't verbal at this point,\u201d Laurinaitis says, \u201cand Nicole almost started\u2026flirting with her eyes with this group of probably grandmothers. The twins just all of a sudden started entertaining these women.\u201d\n\nJohn Francis/Instagram.\n\nA pair of tragedies marred the twins\u2019 senior year of high school\u2014Brie lost her boyfriend to a car accident; Nikki lost her prospective soccer career after suffering a broken leg\u2014and shoved them out of the nest, nearly 400 miles from home. \u201cWe both went through something life-changing,\u201d Brie recalls, \u201cand were like, \u2018Let's go to San Diego, we have cousins there. We could just start fresh.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd so, the sisters packed up their mom\u2019s car and drove to San Diego State, where they had a dorm room for their freshman year at Grossmont College. It was there they \u201cjust started to figure out life and what we wanted,\u201d Brie says. College, it turns out, wasn\u2019t actually on the list.\n\n\n\nTheir extracurriculars were way more enlightening anyway. To pay the bills, Nikki and Brie worked at the Hooters in nearby Mission Valley. It was there that things finally started to click. Because Hooters isn\u2019t just a place for chicken wing aficionados to stare at teeny orange shorts. It\u2019s a place for chicken wing aficionados to watch live sports, too\u2014like, say, wrestling.\n\nOh my gosh this is...this is Nicole and me, Brie remembers thinking while eyeing the TVs. There's entertainment, there's storylines, there's acting, there's athletics.\n\nAnd when she saw an ad for the 2006 Diva Search\u2014a now-discontinued annual talent competition\u2014she knew they had to be part of it. And they were, in matching black tank tops that read \u201cNicole Fo\u2019 Sho\u2019\u201d and \u201cBrizee Fo\u2019 Sheezy,\u201d and black booty shorts with \u201cGarcia Twins\u201d spelled out across the back. No blowouts or makeup, \u201cjust Plain Janes walking in,\u201d as Brie says, in a room that sounds like a cross between a beauty pageant and an NFL cheerleader tryout. They didn\u2019t make it.\n\nLuckily a WWE executive\u2014Kristin Prouty, senior vice president of entertainment relations\u2014saw something in them and gave them a chance anyway, sending the sisters to a training facility in McDonough, Georgia. \u201cI\u2019ll never forget the day Brie and Nicole walked through WWE\u2019s door,\u201d Prouty recalls. \u201cIt was immediately obvious they had something special, that \u2018it\u2019 factor that naturally lights up a room. I thought it would one day light up the world.\u201d For the sisters, it was love at first body slam.\n\n\u201cThis was the connection to something that we'd been waiting for,\u201d Brie says. \u201cSomething to aspire to be. College wasn't for us. We just didn't have the attention span. And it was neat to find something that we actually finally wanted to work for.\u201d\n\nIn the more than a decade since, Nikki and Brie have performed across the country, each held championship titles, and become the breakout stars of Total Divas (of which Nikki is now also an executive producer), which is what led them to scoring their own spinoff.\n\n\u201cIt was a real shock,\u201d Brie says of the offer to star in their own series on the network. \u201cWhat got them is they knew I was going to Tampa to help out Nicole after her neck surgery. So I think a lot of the producers were like, \u2018Wait, Brie and Bryan are moving to Tampa to help Nicole out?\u2019 That really sparked something.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThey really so represent different facets of women,\u201d says Amy Introcaso-Davis, E!\u2019s EVP of development and production, who last month announced the decision to renew the show for a fourth season. \u201cAnd they attack everything with such positivity. They are moving-forward kind of people\u2014I think our audiences really responded to that.\u201d\n\nPlus, there\u2019s just something about the twins, something magnetic, something incessantly watchable, that draws in nearly 1 million total viewers per episode. \u201cThere is that twin bond people are so interested in,\u201d Introcaso-Davis says. \u201cFull disclosure: I am a mother of twins, and there is something so fascinating particularly with identical twins. How they react to things differently or exactly the same or how they finish one another\u2019s sentences. That's something you can't produce.\u201d\n\n\n\nGiphy\n\nThe timing couldn\u2019t be better for a Bellas comeback. In the years since the Bella Twins\u2019 September 2007 debut in the professional wrestling ring, women in the WWE have experienced what the company has dubbed an \u201cevolution.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the goals, before we were actually producing Total Divas and then ultimately the spinoff Total Bellas, was for us to have the ability to showcase the incredible women on our roster,\u201d explains WWE chief brand officer Stephanie McMahon over the phone from Dallas, Texas, a few hours before a live broadcast of WWE Raw.\n\n\u201cWhen you think about them\u2014they are professional athletes but also professional actors, performing in front of tens of thousands of people multiple times a week, traveling the world,\u201d McMahon continues. (WWE is seen in 180 countries in 24 different languages.) \u201cAnd putting their hearts and souls and bodies on the line.\u201d\n\nThe now-higher profile of women in the WWE is, in part, thanks to the success of Total Divas. Back before the July 2013 premiere of the series, the organization\u2019s female wrestlers weren\u2019t exactly given the same screen time or, you know, respect as the men.\n\n\n\nGiphy\n\n\u201cTotal Divas gave us a mainstream platform, letting people really see what the women wrestlers were doing,\u201d Nikki explains. \u201cI think it was the first time even for the WWE universe where they were like, \u2018Whoa the women work really hard! And they work hard inside the ring and outside the ring.\u2019\"\n\n\u201cWe started to get these people coming to the live events because they wanted to see the Total Divas,\u201d Nikki adds, \u201cand they\u2019d be like, \u2018Why did I see women for just two minutes and that was it?\u2019\u201d\n\nRuben Chamorro Brie Bella at Cosmopolitan.com HQ.\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what happened a little over three years ago during on a live episode of Raw. The Bellas won a tag-team match\u2014which would\u2019ve been a hell of a lot more exciting if, say, the match had lasted longer than 30 seconds. The abrupt bout prompted the trending Twitter hashtag #GiveDivasAChance in protest. \u201cFans were specifically asking for more athleticism, longer matches, better character development, better storylines,\u201d McMahon says.\n\nThe WWE, pinned to mat, gave in. The company rebranded the then-Divas Division, which the company announced the following year at what McMahon describes as \u201cthe equivalent of our Super Bowl in front of our largest audience ever.\u201d They decided to call it the Women\u2019s Division, as well as introduce \u201ca new championship belt that was more akin to the men's but still very feminine,\u201d McMahon says.\n\n\n\nThe WWE\u2019s female talent now participates in main event matches, and this fall, the more-than-60-year-old company is hosting its first-ever all-female pay-per-view event, titled, you guessed it, \u201cWWE Evolution,\u201d which will air on October 28 live from New York.\n\n\n\nThe history-making night is partly what inspired the Bellas\u2019 triumphant return to the ring. \u201cWhen they announced the all-women's pay-per-view, I was like, I have to be a part of this,\" Nikki says. \u201cThe women before me, the women of my era, the women now, we all have worked so hard to get to that place and to get women to be just as important as the men in this industry. Nothing is better than to have a comeback now.\u201d\n\nThis is the part where we talk about John Cena\u2014not that we should. And definitely not because his ex-fianc\u00e9e Nikki wants to talk about him\u2014she doesn\u2019t. (In fact, at one point during our conversation, when she refers to him as \u201cmy ex,\u201d she adds: \u201cI can't say his name, legally, anymore\u201d and shares a knowing smile with Brie that makes me unsure whether it\u2019s an inside joke or if she\u2019s serious. FWIW: The guy loves a good contract.) But because this past summer it seemed like all anyone could talk about.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve walked by a supermarket aisle or newsstand in the last few months, you know that John Cena, WWE superstar and aspiring Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, was the prom king to Nikki\u2019s prom queen, if the professional wrestling ring were a high school dance. After dating for nearly five years, much of which was documented on Total Divas and Total Bellas, Cena\u2014fighting back tears, his hands shaking, the excited grin of a kid on Christmas morning across his face\u2014got down on one knee and proposed to Nikki in the middle of the ring on live television during WrestleMania 33.\n\n\n\nBut, as Total Bellas viewers watched over the summer, their happily ever after was cut short. The first time Nikki called the wedding off it was because Cena didn\u2019t want kids and that sacrifice was just too big for her. But when Cena had a change of heart and they got back together, underlying problems\u2014namely, that she felt as if she\u2019d lost herself throughout their relationship and felt a nagging sense of discontentment\u2014surfaced and she called it off for good.\n\nAs she told Brie and their mother in an emotional car ride after she\u2019d left the Tampa home she\u2019d shared with Cena: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the 66-year-old woman that starts living her happy life at 63.\u201d\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s something about the wobbliness of her voice, her face unconsciously contorting to fight back tears, the sort of tired I\u2019ve-been-up-all-night-worrying look on all three of their faces, that makes the moment feel real, affecting, intimate even. So much so in fact, that maybe you\u2019re, I don\u2019t know, sort of embarrassed to admit that OK, fine, you teared up watching it the first time, and then again when you were writing this story. Which makes all of the cynical albeit somewhat understandable (it is reality TV, after all) fan conspiracy theories that the breakup is just for show seem that much more unbearable.\n\nRuben Chamorro Nikki Bella at Cosmopolitan.com HQ.\n\n\u201cWhen everyone was saying what I was going through was fake for ratings and all that,\u201d Nikki says, \u201cand when you're really going through it, it's like, you're just, in my heartache you're literally just knifing it and just churning it.\u201d\n\nReliving the breakup each week on television was difficult. Being questioned about it at every press appearance and criticized by fans on social media was excruciating. \u201cWe\u2019re both are at the point that we just don't want to be talked about at all together anymore,\u201d Nikki says. \u201cWe don't want our breakup to define us or interfere with our work. And that was happening for a while.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just the spotlight-stealing attention that got to Nikki\u2014it was the criticism and hate from fans who thought she was making a mistake, being \u201ctoo cold\u201d to Cena by no longer wanting the life she\u2019d thought she did. Imagine going to work and all that your boss, the mailroom guy, and your cubicle-mate want to talk about is your breakup and why you\u2019ve got it all wrong.\n\nNikki understands that she\u2019s in the public eye\u2014she\u2019s the one who\u2019s put it all out there\u2014so of course people will feel a right to have, and express, their opinions about her personal life. That said, \u201cgoing through all that, I don't ever want to do it again,\u201d she says. \u201cIt scares me to ever have another public relationship.\u201d\n\nBut the fear isn\u2019t just about the heartbreak or the public scrutiny. \u201cI don't want my relationship to define who I am, as a woman,\u201d she says calmly. Nikki doesn\u2019t sound angry or bitter or sad. She doesn\u2019t even break eye contact. She speaks with the sort of clarity a person finds after a heartbreak finally starts healing. \u201cAnd to take away all the hard work that I've ever done in my career,\u201d she continues. \u201cI think for a man, it's different. I feel like, if anything, the woman gets blamed for what happens, for taking away from what they do. But I get all my work taken away because of that. I don\u2019t know, I feel like sometimes there's a double standard and I really have felt that. And it's been really, really hard.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo anyway, Nikki, who is seeing a life coach, is working on self-love, something \u201cI lost for so many years,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was all my fault. I'm the one who forgot about me. I have realized now to truly have a happy life, you have to give yourself so much love first and work on you in any way you can.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat happy life? It\u2019s about more than championship belts and reality-TV fame: \u201csunsets, wine, family.\u201d For Brie, it\u2019s \u201cwaking up in the morning and my daughter seeing me when she wakes up, and having my mornings with her.\u201d Also: \u201cNot caring what people think.\u201d\n\n\n\nGiphy\n\nRuben Chamorro Brie and Nikki at Cosmopolitan.com HQ.\n\nOh, and \u201chappy hour.\u201d\n\nRight now the twins are tackling two burgeoning businesses, two reality shows, vlogging, appearances, motherhood, and dating, and they\u2019re actually doing it themselves, not with the entourage of support so many celebrities tap into at this stage of their careers.\n\n\"Brie and I don't have personal assistants, we don't have a manager, we truly do everything on our own,\u201d Nikki says. \u201cWe keep each other in check and we really help each other out. We're kind of each other's personal assistants.\u201d But, perhaps most importantly, today Nikki and Brie are focused on the ring and the change they\u2019re helping body slam into it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in the middle of history being made, which is amazing to witness,\u201d Nikki says. \u201cIt's just how I think of being around women when they were told they could vote. I would have loved to have felt that energy. I'd have popped so many bottles of champagne.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhotographed by Ruben Chamorro; lead wrestling images courtesy of WWE.\n\nStyled by Andrew Gelwicks.
