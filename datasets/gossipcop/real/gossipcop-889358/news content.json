Yes, in some ways you could argue I\u2019ve been employed for a look I have. But there\u2019s a sexism that happens towards men. There\u2019s definitely a sexism in our industry towards women and there is towards men as well. At some points during photoshoots when I\u2019m asked to strip down, I felt that.\u201d\n\nClarkson appeared to have little sympathy for Harrington\u2019s supposed plight when asked about the comments by the Guardian, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s a sex symbol. Get over it. You have an amazing career and you\u2019re on a hot show. Take your shirt off.\u201d\n\nThe Green Mile actress was discussing some gendered negative responses to the upcoming Ghostbusters all-female remake when she claimed white male actors don\u2019t have a leg to stand on when bemoaning anything in the film industry.\n\n\u201cThere are still so many movies made starring 50 men and one woman! A white male actor should never be allowed to complain about anything,\u201d the 56-year-old said. \u201cShut up and sit in the corner. I mean, seriously!\u201d", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/06/10/14/patricia-clarkson.jpg", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/06/10/14/patricia-clarkson.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/06/10/14/patricia-clarkson.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/game-of-thrones-kit-harington-patricia-clarkson-sexism-stop-complaining-get-topless-a7074511.html", "title": "Kit Harington should stop complaining about sexism towards men and take his shirt off, claims Patricia Clarkson", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "People", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/news/people", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "'He's a sex symbol.
