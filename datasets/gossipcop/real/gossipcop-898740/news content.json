It\u2019s not a fairy tale love story. She\u2019s actually meeting somebody when she\u2019s still extremely wounded and so is he, as we later discover,\u201d Kirby tells Variety. \u201cMatthew Goode is incredible. He encapsulated everything Margaret was trying to discover in season one, which was anti-establishment, anti-royal [and] made her feel \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 more complete.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nFor Kirby, a continued challenge comes to portraying Princess Margaret in that duality of being \u201cso essentially royal\u201d and \u201cpart of this old establishment\u201d while still wanting to be \u201cnormal and a modern woman.\u201d In the second season, her forward motion as a somewhat unwilling princess straining at the confines of royal responsibility are front and center.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more about how Margaret is wrestling with remaining part of her family and not having a choice of the way she wants to live her life \u2014 the man and the children she would have had,\u201d Kirby says of the emotional journey. \u201cShe\u2019s attempting to define herself in contrary to it. That\u2019s why she finds someone very distinctly unroyal, that\u2019s not approved by the establishment, that\u2019s not aristocratic. She finds her salvation in [Snowdon], who is the antithesis of her life and past.\u201d\n\nSnowdon has a significant effect on Margaret when it comes to her \u201csense of place in the world,\u201d Kirby continues. \u201cHer autonomy to meet someone who was her wingman and someone she could confide in and love and walk down the aisle with [was] something she\u2019d always been waiting to do.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the continued complexity of playing Philip, for Smith, comes from the fact that he is a man who loves his wife but is perpetually frustrated being in second position to her royal needs and responsibilities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always really compelled by the deep conflict in Philip,\u201d Smith says, citing \u201chis duty to himself as a man\u201d first. \u201cHe\u2019s a very male character, whatever that means nowadays, and his duty to his wife and the strange conflict it generates in him: the desire to be the head of the family and being usurped. They\u2019re weirdly similar in that way, Philip and Margaret, they wanted their own wings but they were constantly being clipped.\u201d\n\nThis is something Kirby has noticed throughout the series as well. \u201cWhen Philip says, \u2018You\u2019ve taken my name, you\u2019ve taken my home,\u2019 that\u2019s what every woman says. It was quite amazing to see a series where a man says that,\u201d she points out.\n\nSmith acknowledges that the public\u2019s ongoing fascination with the royal family and what they may be like behind closed doors versus their public appearances is a driving factor for the second season of \u201cThe Crown.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re often most interesting when they\u2019re being domestic. That\u2019s what\u2019s good about the show: you come to understand they\u2019re normal human beings \u2014 their blood isn\u2019t blue, contrary to popular opinion,\u201d he says.\n\nTo that point, viewers will also learn more about Philip\u2019s younger years. \u201cWe glimpse the difficulty and the pain and tragedy he went through and we see why he is the way he is now. We see the sardonic, dry wit and where it comes from; it\u2019s borne out of pain,\u201d Smith explains.\n\nMarital strife is front and center in the second season, as well, as Philip and Elizabeth continue to struggle with being man and wife vs. Queen and royal subject. \u201cThere\u2019s a scene in season two where Philip and Elizabeth have an argument about where Charles should go to school. He says, \u2018You can\u2019t keep falling back on what the royal family needs, what about what I need?\u2019 And I like the fact that Philip\u2019s needy! He\u2019s a needy man but he\u2019s also a really male man. He needs her attention,\u201d Smith says.\n\nOf course, what happens if and when Elizabeth cannot give Philip the attention he needs will undoubtedly add to the marital tension felt within the second season.\n\n\u201cThe Crown\u201d Season 2 streams Dec. 8 on Netflix.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/thecrown_203_unit_00424_r_crop1.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/thecrown_203_unit_00424_r_crop1.jpg?w=1000&h=667&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/thecrown_203_unit_00424_r_crop1.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Diane Gordon", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/features/the-crown-season-2-matt-smith-vanessa-kirby-interview-1202629420/", "title": "\u2018The Crown\u2019 Stars on Season 2 Marital Tension, Life Outside Buckingham Palace and Diving Deeper Into Character", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"The Crown\" stars Matt Smith and Vanessa Kirby preview Season 2 of Netflix's hit period drama.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Diane Gordon", "tags": "Matt Smith, The Crown, Vanessa Kirby", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018The Crown\u2019 Stars on Season 2 Marital Tension, Life Outside Buckingham Palace and Diving Deeper Into Character", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/features/the-crown-season-2-matt-smith-vanessa-kirby-interview-1202629420/", "description": "\"The Crown\" stars Matt Smith and Vanessa Kirby preview Season 2 of Netflix's hit period drama.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/thecrown_203_unit_00424_r_crop1.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "The Crown(L to R) Elizabeth, Adeane, PhilipElizabeth and Philip return from the world tour"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-04T19:00:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-04T19:00:14+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"The Crown\" stars Matt Smith and Vanessa Kirby preview Season 2 of Netflix's hit period drama.", "site": "@variety", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018The Crown\u2019 Stars on Season 2 Marital Tension, Life Outside Buckingham Palace and Diving Deeper Into Character", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/thecrown_203_unit_00424_r_crop1.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512414012.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
