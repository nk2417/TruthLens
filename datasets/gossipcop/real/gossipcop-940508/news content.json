Here We Go Again, the extremely sun-kissed sequel to 2008\u2019s international smash Mamma Mia! As a member of a very stacked cast\u2014Meryl Streep! Colin Firth! Christine Baranski! Andy Garcia! Cher!!\u2014Dominic Cooper, playing the genial, abdominally blessed Sky, boyfriend to our charming lead Sophie (played by Amanda Seyfried), has a key role. At the beginning of the sequel, Sky, on a business trip in New York, and Sophie find themselves grappling with the challenges of a (temporarily) long-distance relationship. Will Sky find his way back to her? And, more pressingly, which ABBA hit will the two sing once he does?\n\nThe Mamma Mia! franchise has also influenced Cooper\u2019s personal life. The 40-year-old actor\u2014who can currently be seen in the third season of AMC\u2019s Preacher as well\u2014dated Seyfried in real life, after meeting her on the film, and the two were together for more than three years before splitting up. (Seyfried would tell Elle in 2011 that she \u201cgot her heart broken pretty hard.\u201d) Seyfried is now married to actor Thomas Sadoski, and the two have a young child together\u2014but Seyfried and Cooper still maintain a good relationship, even if she has said it was a bit awkward for Sadoski that she and her real-life ex-boyfriend were going to be reuniting on set.\n\nWe spoke to Cooper earlier this week to discuss the \u201chigh-school reunion\u201d vibe of the sequel, how he felt about working with Seyfried, if he thinks there could potentially be a third Mamma Mia! film down the road, and Cher\u2019s first impression of him.\n\nVanity Fair: At the screening I went to, the crowd was audibly cheering, clapping, and singing along for most of the film. What was it like for you seeing it for the first time?\n\nDominic Cooper: It was very exciting for me the other day. I saw it for the first time with the audience [at the premiere], and I kind of purposely made this decision\u2014which was to wait until that audience on the premiere night, which was at the Hammersmith Apollo. So it\u2019s a huge, huge amount of people. I\u2019ve always had sort of slight amounts of anticipation as to whether people would respond so well to the slightly more emotional direction of this [sequel]. And they really did. It was a really sort of slow build. And it was clever putting together the story with flashbacks, the prequel into sequel. And I think [the audience] really went with it and took to it. It\u2019s like this tiny ember that\u2019s slightly getting brighter and brighter\u2014and then by the end, when Cher steps on, it\u2019s completely illuminating.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69138dc2108d96082627c8f5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691749567922be8584aa2766/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6912302be09f2aa2f0d4b6ab/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b50ab2f7a97170b75493793/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Dominic-Cooper-Mamma-Mia-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69025f69e6eefa9bbbbf2d2f/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b50ab2f7a97170b75493793/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Dominic-Cooper-Mamma-Mia-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690cd8954962ddec3a078f19/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69161589683a0692afe31872/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69178ae76161d5beda0d5421/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69139732b0b7e0bbf578f050/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69029073963ccd75d51829af/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69133facb7897d9e50eef0da/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6914ab554a83822bb12772b6/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e12eca31582bb6e461be9/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54d3a8f99f9fa5f230b14590/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b50ab2f7a97170b75493793/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Dominic-Cooper-Mamma-Mia-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Josh Duboff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/dominic-cooper-mamma-mia-2-interview-cher-amanda-seyfried", "title": "Why Cher Took Some Time to Warm Up to Dominic Cooper", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Josh Duboff", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "The Mamma Mia!
