As Evans recalls a book he read while they were still together, the article states that the two called it off recently. Evans says he learned to listen more while reading Rebecca Solnit\u2019s The Mother of All Questions: \u201cThe hardest thing to reconcile is that just because you have good intentions, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s your time to have a voice,\u201d the actor, now starring in Lobby Hero on Broadway, told the Times.\n\nThe on-again, off-again couple was spotted together again in October 2017 after first breaking up in February following nearly a year of dating. Flirty Twitter exchanges between the two soon followed, sending fans into a frenzy about the possibility of their reunion.\n\nEmma McIntyre/Getty\n\nThe rumors gained more steam when Evans posted several videos of his beloved dog appearing to sing along to music while a woman who sounded suspiciously like Slate laughed in the background. PEOPLE later confirmed the rekindling in late November.\n\nSlate spent Christmas with Evans and his family. She posed with his brother Scott for a selfie he posted to Instagram. \u201cChristmas with my favorite Jew!\u201d the look-alike Evans brother captioned the shot.\n\nThe former couple met on the set of their drama Gifted in 2016, where sources told PEOPLE their connection was undeniable. When they weren\u2019t busy filming, Evans and Slate would spend much of their free time hanging out together.\n\nSlate gushed about Evans on the The Secret Life of Pets\u2018 red carpet, telling Entertainment Tonight, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like I got my dream seventh grade boyfriend. We didn\u2019t know each other growing up, but we grew up about a half hour away from each other. We\u2019ve been friends for a while.\u201d\n\nShe later opened up about her split from the superhero movie star, saying differences in their careers eventually led to their breakup.\n\n\u201cChris is a very, very famous person,\u201d she said in a interview with Vulture. \u201cFor him to go to a restaurant is totally different than for me to go. I sit in my window and I say \u2018Hi\u2019 to people on the street. I have more freedom because I\u2019m not Captain America. I\u2019m mostly a cartoon.\u201d\n\nSlate said the attention eventually became too much.\n\n\u201cThis is what I needed to do to feel normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cTo be alone.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jenny Slate On What Makes \u201cGifted\u201d Costar Chris Evans Such A \u201cBeautiful\u201d Human Being\n\nBut in the months following their original split, Evans and Slate remained amicable and supportive, often praising each other in the press.\n\n\u201cWe all love each other so much, and it\u2019s a real, real love,\u201d Slate told PEOPLE while promoting their film Gifted. \u201cI mean, I have gone on and on about how beautiful Chris is. He is, inside and out.\u201d\n\nEvans echoed her comments, saying she was his \u201cfavorite human.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the best. I\u2019ve never ever ever met someone in my life who has a mastery of the English language the way she does,\u201d Evans told PEOPLE of Slate. \u201cShe\u2019ll give you one sentence and there\u2019s no fat to it. You\u2019re like, \u2018You just chose such an unbelievable collection of words that beautifully articulate what you say.\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like an art form talking with her, because the visuals associated with her expression are just so colorful,\u201d he continued. \u201cShe\u2019s so vulnerable, so honest, so interested in other people more than herself, she\u2019s incredibly compassionate, there\u2019s just nothing to not love about her.\u201d", "images":
