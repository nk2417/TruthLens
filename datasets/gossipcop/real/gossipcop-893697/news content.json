Abrams and other stars compiled a goofy short film to celebrate Jimmy Kimmel\u2018s 50th birthday.\n\nThe inspiration for the amusing gift was The Terrific Ten, a comic book that Kimmel drew when he was a boy. The story is full of made-up heroes like \u201cColor Kid.\u201d \u201cColor Kid was the best because he had all the powers of the rainbow, which are really none,\u201d Kimmel joked. \u201cThe characters really spoke to me, and they demanded to be brought to life,\u201d Abrams said. \u201cI took this exact book [as a script]; I didn\u2019t change a word.\u201d\n\nThe resulting clip is a testament to Kimmel\u2019s star reach: The Terrible Ten includes Affleck, Zach Galifianakis, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Will Arnett, Jon Hamm, Jason Bateman and Jennifer Aniston. Damon shows up as their the evil, melodramatic nemesis, Dr. Bolt.\n\nTrending Stories Kevin Spacey Says He Has 'No Home' After Sexual Misconduct Allegations Brandi Carlile and Patty Loveless Pay Tribute to Vince Gill at 2025 CMA Awards 2025 CMA Awards: The Complete Winners List Neighbor Indicted in Murder of \u2018King of the Hill\u2019 Star Jonathan Joss\n\nThe segment also demonstrates how easy it is to poke fun at the grandiose dialogue and self-important approach of many superhero movies. In contrast, The Terrible Ten and Damon spend so much time complaining about their lack of powers and embarrassing outfits that they forget to fight each other. \u201cWe all suck,\u201d Damon concludes. \u201cWe were created by a weird, sad kid who grew to later become a weird, fat man.\u201d\n\nAfter Abrams and Affleck debuted their project, Kimmel called it \u201cthe best gift I ever got.\u201d Affleck\u2019s other movie, the superhero-traffic-jam Justice League, opens on Friday.", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/screen-shot-2017-11-14-at-85749-am-6bef9abb-c3c7-49de-90af-c6fd2251eb64.png?w=1430&h=718&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/screen-shot-2017-11-14-at-85749-am-6bef9abb-c3c7-49de-90af-c6fd2251eb64.png?w=1430&h=718&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elias Leight", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/see-ben-affleck-matt-damon-bring-jimmy-kimmels-childhood-comic-to-life-128822/", "title": "See Ben Affleck, Matt Damon Bring Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s Childhood Comic to Life", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, J.J.
