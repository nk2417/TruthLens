But there were a few memorable moments that didn\u2019t make TV One\u2019s live telecast from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium. The Hollywood Reporter shares the things the live broadcast missed:\n\n1. Before host Anderson kicked off his opening monologue with talk of Oprah Winfrey\u2019s potential presidential run (\u201cWhy would she move to a smaller house?\u201d), attendees turned to THR to brainstorm who her running mate could be. Lil Rel Howery suggested Gayle King, Loretta Devine mentioned Tyler Perry and Yvonne Orji hoped for Michelle Obama. Storm Reid, who is 14 years old and won\u2019t be eligible to vote in 2020, said of her Wrinkle in Time co-star, \u201cI\u2019d vote for her if I could \u2014 it\u2019s way better than what we have right now!\u201d\n\n2. Anticipation was high for the upcoming Marvel movie Black Panther, as its stars Chadwick Boseman, Michael B. Jordan, Danai Gurira, Sterling K. Brown and Kaluuya were in attendance. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna change the world \u2014 I genuinely felt that on set,\u201d Kaluuya told THR. Attendees also lamented the myth that \u201cblack movies\u201d don\u2019t sell internationally \u2014 Yvette Nicole Brown explained, \u201cThat\u2019s crap\u2026. You love our butts, our lips, our music, our sports prowess, you love our inventions and you love that we built this entire country, but somehow you can\u2019t watch us play a mother in a movie or play an action star in a movie? Somehow that\u2019s just a stretch?\u201d\n\n3. However, attendees were split when it came to the HBO series Insecure, as THR polled whether people are rooting for the character Issa or for Lawrence. Girls Trip\u2018s Malcolm D. Lee is pulling for Lawrence, and Danielle Brooks is backing Issa.\n\n4. The first award of the night was presented by Kerry Washington, Tracee Ellis Ross, Lena Waithe, Jurnee Smollett-Bell, Angela Robinson and Laverne Cox, who also shared a powerful message on behalf of the initiative Time\u2019s Up. The group said that black women had \u201calways been on the front lines of change\u201d and challenged viewers to \u201cstand by us, stand for us, stand with us.\u201d Unfortunately, since the ceremony was a live telecast, doors to the auditorium closed once the show began and only let people in during commercial breaks. That means dozens of attendees \u2014 including Empire\u2018s Jussie Smollett, whose own sister was onstage \u2014 were stuck in the lobby, watching the moment on a big-screen TV.\n\n5. During the commercial break, a microphone was passed to representative Maxine Waters, who stood up to introduce her guest: Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner. She then told the venue to great applause, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna impeach Trump.\u201d\n\n6. After the ceremony \u2014 which closed with DuVernay\u2019s uplifting speech and a standing ovation \u2014 the party continued with a bash next door at the Pasadena Ballroom, which was also the setting for a Key & Peele reunion, as former co-stars Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele caught up while grabbing a drink at the bar.\n\n7. The kids of Blackish, This Is Us and Stranger Things kicked things off on the dance floor, forming a circle and showing off their best moves. Caleb McLaughlin, who won the award for best youth performance, got massive applause for his spins and splits.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-905469634-embed.jpg?w=928", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-905391080_copy.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/317a3e37-4857-4429-a968-b9d7ac786a67.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-905370402-embed.jpg?w=928", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-905474436-embed.jpg?w=928", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/317a3e37-4857-4429-a968-b9d7ac786a67.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ashley Lee", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/naacp-image-awards-2018-party-things-you-didnt-see-tv-1074934/", "title": "NAACP Image Awards: 7 Things the TV Cameras Missed", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A ton of excitement for Marvel's 'Black Panther,' a strong statement from Maxine Waters, a 'Key &amp; Peele' reunion and a 'Stranger Things' star's sweet dance moves.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Ashley Lee", "tags": "NAACP Image Awards", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "NAACP Image Awards: 7 Things the TV Cameras Missed", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/naacp-image-awards-2018-party-things-you-didnt-see-tv-1074934/", "description": "A ton of excitement for Marvel's 'Black Panther,' a strong statement from Maxine Waters, a 'Key & Peele' reunion and a 'Stranger Things' star's sweet dance moves.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/317a3e37-4857-4429-a968-b9d7ac786a67.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "NAACP Image Awards 2018 Party: Things You Didn't See on TV"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-16T07:05:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-29T07:24:47+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "A ton of excitement for Marvel's 'Black Panther,' a strong statement from Maxine Waters, a 'Key & Peele' reunion and a 'Stranger Things' star's sweet dance moves.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "NAACP Image Awards: 7 Things the TV Cameras Missed", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/317a3e37-4857-4429-a968-b9d7ac786a67.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516086301.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
