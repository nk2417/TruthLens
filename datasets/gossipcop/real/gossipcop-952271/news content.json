Instead, let me fill you in on what she\u2019s been up to: caring for her new baby boy, headlining the Apple Music Super Bowl LVII Halftime Show (her first live performance since 2018), and continuing to release sell-out-within-minutes pieces with and While the promise of a new album has yet to be confirmed (please, God), here\u2019s Rihanna, in her own words, on traveling, life as a new mom, and her favorite product to look extra-alive.\n\nOn motherhood and beauty\n\n\u201cBecoming a mother has only added to the inspiration in my life. I\u2019ve had to find the balance between an efficient routine that maximizes precious \u2018me\u2019 time and full glam, because I really enjoy that colorful creative process.\u201d\n\nOn inventing a new lipstick\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to matte liquid lipstick, we all know the deal\u2014intense pigment often comes with intense dryness. I wanted to fix that. Fenty Beauty Fenty Icon Velvet Liquid Lipstick has a luxe formula that\u2019s creamy and whipped so that the color glides on and feels plush but won\u2019t crack. That\u2019s why we call it a \u2018velvet matte.\u2019 It comes in a range of five shades of reds, pinks, and neutrals that are flexible and work on everyone.\u201d\n\nOn her long-flight beauty routine\n\n\u201cI do everything I can to stay hydrated, from applying moisturizers to drinking coconut water\u2014it\u2019s really the only way to save your skin, especially on those long flights to different time zones and climates. I bring with me on overnight flights, and because it coats my lips and keeps them full-looking. Hydration from head to toe is key!\u201d\n\nOn why smelling good is so important\n\n\u201cMy mom was the first person to introduce me to beauty and fragrance. I loved her scent, and smelling good was really important to her. It was always the finishing touch before she would go out. And that\u2019s how I treat fragrance today: I want it to exude everything that I feel, everything that I am, and everything that I want to be.\u201d\n\nOn her beauty legacy\n\n\u201cMy mantra has always been and always will be, \u2018Beauty is there to have fun with. It should never feel like pressure or a uniform.\u2019 I hope that carries on, because it\u2019s an incredibly joyful and freeing way to live.\u201d\n\nInspired by Rihanna's Routine Fenty Beauty Fenty Eau de Parfum $140 at Sephora \u201cThis scent captures so many memories and places that are personal to me, and I love that it becomes personal and unique to everyone who wears it.\u201d Premium Vials Amber Glass Bottle $1 at premiumvials.com \u201cI keep a travel spray bottle with me so I can spritz on the go. I\u2019ll put water or rose water in it to elevate the experience.\u201d Fenty Beauty Fenty Icon Velvet Liquid Lipstick $29 at Fenty Beauty Credit: Courtesy \u201cI love that lipstick is so expressive. Even when I\u2019m tired, I can just put on a bomb lipstick, and bam\u2014I\u2019m vibrant and alive.\u201d\n\nThis article appears in the March 2023 issue of ELLE.", "images":
