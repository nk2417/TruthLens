Nick and Joe had a double date with their significant others, Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner, in London on Monday. Older brother Kevin, despite being the only married one, was also there, solo as the fifth wheel.\n\nNick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra have been getting more serious about their relationship recently, even taking a trip to India together where he reportedly met some of her friends and family. Middle bro Joe has already taken the next step with Turner, proposing to the Game of Thrones actress last year.\n\nAs for Kevin, he\u2019s been busy with his two kids and wife, former hair stylist Danielle Jonas, who he married in 2009. The couple met while he was still in the Jonas Brothers back in 2007 while on vacation in the Bahamas. They even briefly dabbled in reality television with their E! show, Married to Jonas.\n\nDanielle\u2019s absence doesn\u2019t seem to be cause for concern though. Just last week Kevin was gushing over his wife on Instagram, writing, \u201cLove every moment with you.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69138dc2108d96082627c8f5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68ff9a93b697272970dd743c/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68f790dfdb70b2cb60162c9d/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690b9fc0ec5ef29213749182/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4e25cc4f46c70bca18e95a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Jonas-Double-Date-Third-Wheel.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4d14774f46c70bca18e94c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Kate-Wimbledon.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3fa83f384c1d5c5734c04b/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/t-nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b44d8beb6f2ad0babc6e935/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/young-couple-engagements-lede.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691388cbb0b7e0bbf578f04e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b2fb8dff47a36695449ccea/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/priyanka-chopra-nick-jonas.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4d147832b3790c82c9bc22/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Emma-Watson.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6902272ce593df117190f65c/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68f8fed003a28097fee44ebd/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6914ab554a83822bb12772b6/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69035eb14569ea73fa6937b7/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4e0c977201c40b959f9b48/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/emma%2520watson%2520wimbledon%2520suit.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4e25cc4f46c70bca18e95a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Jonas-Double-Date-Third-Wheel.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erika Harwood"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/nick-joe-jonas-london-double-date", "title": "Nick and Joe Jonas Went on a Double Date with Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Erika Harwood", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Kevin Jonas was there to serve as fifth wheel.", "id": "5b4e236afde90b0b82d2f302", "keywords": "vanities,nick jonas,joe jonas,priyanka chopra,sophie turner", "news_keywords": "vanities,nick jonas,joe jonas,priyanka chopra,sophie turner", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b4e236afde90b0b82d2f302", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Kevin Jonas was there to serve as fifth wheel.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4e25cc4f46c70bca18e95a/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Jonas-Double-Date-Third-Wheel.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4e25cc4f46c70bca18e95a/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Jonas-Double-Date-Third-Wheel.png\"}", "og": {"description": "Kevin Jonas was there to serve as fifth wheel.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4e25cc4f46c70bca18e95a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Jonas-Double-Date-Third-Wheel.png", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Nick and Joe Jonas Went on a Double Date with Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/nick-joe-jonas-london-double-date"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-07-17T17:26:50.700Z", "modified_time": "2018-07-17T17:26:50.700Z", "author": "Erika Harwood"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Kevin Jonas was there to serve as fifth wheel.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4e25cc4f46c70bca18e95a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Jonas-Double-Date-Third-Wheel.png?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Nick and Joe Jonas Went on a Double Date with Priyanka Chopra and Sophie Turner"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4e25cc4f46c70bca18e95a/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/Jonas-Double-Date-Third-Wheel.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google": "nopagereadaloud", "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531848410.7, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
