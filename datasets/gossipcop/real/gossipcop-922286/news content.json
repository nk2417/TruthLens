On the Tuesday, March 20, episode of the relationship reality show, the three couples struggled with what it meant to make their marriages the real deal. Some couples navigated the rocky waters with skill, while others were on the verge of sinking.\n\nRelated: Stars Who Got Their Start on Reality TV The road to success in Hollywood is a little different for every would-be actor, but these days, reality TV is becoming a major launching pad for some of the industry's biggest stars. Before they were red-carpet regulars, NeNe Leakes, Jennifer Hudson, Julianne Hough and Lucy Hale were among those who broke through as reality stars\n\nShawniece and Jephte Make Up, Again\n\nJephte was so upset at the prospect of having to surrender his phone to Shawniece that he walked out. She refused to chase him. After getting some (good) advice from his friend, he left her a few roses as an apology. Later, they discussed their five-year plan and surprisingly, seemed to be on the same page when it came to career, travel and kids.\n\nMolly and Jonathan Still Haven\u2019t had Sex\n\nMolly was committed to showing Jonathan more physical affection. Instead, though, she gave him a gift card to his favorite story for his birthday. Apparently, that did the trick, though! No man has ever been more excited for a gift card.\n\nRelated: Couples Who Survived the Reality TV Curse Who says true love doesn\u2019t exist on reality TV? While it seems to be a trend that many marriages on reality TV end in divorce, there are still some reality TV couples out there beating the odds. Big Brother\u2018s Nicole Franzel and Victor Arroyo met while filming season 18 of Big Brother in 2016. The timing [\u2026]\n\nJaclyn and Ryan Hit a Rough Patch\n\nDuring a boys\u2019 night out with Jonathan, Jephte, and Pastor Cal, Ryan revealed that he and Jaclyn were feeling tension about her desire to live a \u201cgypsy\u201d lifestyle, which he wasn\u2019t feeling. Pastor Cal reasoned that she might just want some extended vacations, but Ryan argued that she wanted to move abroad. Instead of going home to Jaclyn (who was sick), Ryan opted to leave the boys\u2019 night to hang with a friend. Jaclyn later told the camera that Ryan was drunk and she was feeling a bit over the marriage.\n\nRelated: Reality TV\u2019s Breakout Stars From Honey Boo Boo to the Real Housewives, see which celebs make for must-see TV\n\nThey talked it out the next night. The conversation was civil, but she revealed that she was worried he wasn\u2019t making space for her in his life. He asked for more slack and she asked him if he just didn\u2019t want to be married at all. He insisted he wanted to be married and they hugged it out \u2026 for now.\n\nTell Us: Which couple do you think is the strongest right now?\n\nMarried at First Sight airs on Lifetime Tuesdays at 9
