{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Roddick_career_statistics", "text": "This is a list of the main career statistics of retired professional American tennis player, Andy Roddick. Throughout his career, Roddick won thirty-two ATP singles titles including one grand slam singles title and five ATP Masters 1000 singles titles. He was also the runner-up at the Wimbledon Championships in 2004, 2005 and 2009 and the US Open in 2006, losing on all four occasions to Roger Federer. Roddick was also a four-time semifinalist at the Australian Open and a three-time semifinalist at the year-ending ATP World Tour Finals. On November 3, 2003, Roddick became the World No. 1 for the first time in his career.\n\nCareer achievements [ edit ]\n\nRoddick won thirty-two singles titles throughout his career including one grand slam singles title at the 2003 US Open.\n\nRoddick reached his first career Grand Slam singles quarterfinal at the 2001 US Open, where he lost to fourth-seeded Australian and eventual champion Lleyton Hewitt in a five-set thriller 7\u20136, 3\u20136, 4\u20136, 6\u20133, 4\u20136. A year later, he reached his first Masters Series singles final at the 2002 Rogers Cup, losing in straight sets to Argentine Guillermo Ca\u00f1as. The following year, Roddick reached his first grand slam semifinal at the 2003 Australian Open, where he lost to thirty-first seed Rainer Sch\u00fcttler in four sets, 5\u20137, 6\u20132, 3\u20136, 3\u20136. In August, after beating Roger Federer for the first time in 5 meetings, Roddick would advance to the final of the 2003 Rogers Cup. Playing an Argentine in the Rogers Cup final for the second consecutive year, he would defeat David Nalbandian in straight sets to win his first Big title in singles at the Rogers Cup. The following week, Roddick would win his first five matches at the 2003 Cincinnati Masters to reach his third Masters Series final where he would face his childhood friend, Mardy Fish. After nearly 2+1\u20442 hours, Roddick would defeat Fish 4\u20136, 7\u20136(7-3), 7-6(7-4) his second consecutive Masters Series title. Two weeks later, Roddick rallied from two sets, and a match point, down to defeat Nalbandian in five sets to reach his first Grand Slam singles final at the 2003 US Open. Roddick defeated No. 4-seed Spaniard Juan Carlos Ferrero in the final, 6\u20133, 7\u20136, 6\u20133, to win his first and only Grand Slam singles title of his career (he would make four more grand slam finals, but lost all four to Roger Federer. By virtue of his Canada Masters, Cincinnati Masters, and US Open titles in the same season, Roddick became just the 2nd man in the Open Era, joining Patrick Rafter, to complete the Summer Slam (Rafael Nadal would join them in 2013). Roddick's six Tour titles throughout the year allowed him to qualify for the year-ending 2003 ATP World Tour Finals for the first time in his career. He advanced to the semifinals of the event after victories over Guillermo Coria and Carlos Moy\u00e1 in the round robin stage but lost in straight sets to then world No. 2 Roger Federer. Despite the loss, Roddick finished the year as the Year-end No. 1 for the first (and only) time in his career, becoming the first American player to finish as Year-end No. 1 since Andre Agassi in 1999.\n\nIn July 2004, Roddick reached his first Wimbledon final but lost in four sets to then World No. 1, Roger Federer. He reached the final of the event again the following year but once again lost to Federer, this time in straight sets. The following year, Roddick reached his fourth grand slam singles final but once again lost to Federer, this time in the final of the US Open. In 2007, Roddick reached the semifinals of the year-ending ATP World Tour Finals for the third and final time in his career, losing in straight sets to Spaniard, David Ferrer.\n\nRoddick enjoyed a resurgent year in 2009, during which he reached the semifinals of the Australian Open for the fourth and final time in his career and the fourth round of the French Open for the first and only time in his career. The highlight of Roddick's year came at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships where he reached his third final at the event and fifth and final grand slam singles final. There, he lost to Federer 7\u20135, 6\u20137(6-8), 6\u20137(5-7), 6\u20133, 14\u201316 in 4 hours 16 minutes. On July 22, 2012, Roddick won his thirty-second and final career singles title at the Atlanta Tennis Championships, defeating Gilles M\u00fcller of Luxembourg in the final in three sets; Roddick won his first career singles title at the same event eleven years prior.\n\nSingles performance timeline [ edit ]\n\nKey W F SF QF #R RR Q# P# DNQ A Z# PO G S B NMS NTI P NH\n\n(W) winner; (F) finalist;
