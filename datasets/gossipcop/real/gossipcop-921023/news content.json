See more stars in court such as Taylor Swift, Lindsay Lohan and more.\n\nThe 52-year-old former Dance Moms star was sentenced to 366 days in federal prison in May 2017 for bankruptcy fraud. However, due to good behavior, her initial release date of June 21 has been moved up. Her new date is now projected to be May 25, which \u201cincludes credit for good conduct time that may be earned throughout the remainder of her sentence,\u201d the bureau told Us Weekly on Friday, March 16.\n\nUs Weekly caught up with former mentee of Miller\u2019s, Nia Sioux, at the Midnight Sun premiere on Thursday, March 15, who dished on leaving her former Dance Moms life behind. \u201cProbably not,\u201d Sioux told Us about the possibility of reconnecting with Miller post-jail. \u201cNever say never, but I\u2019ve pretty much distanced myself for a while.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars Who Got Their Start on Reality TV The road to success in Hollywood is a little different for every would-be actor, but these days, reality TV is becoming a major launching pad for some of the industry's biggest stars. Before they were red-carpet regulars, NeNe Leakes, Jennifer Hudson, Julianne Hough and Lucy Hale were among those who broke through as reality stars\n\nThe 16-year-old dancer did, however, reveal that she \u201creally learned so much from\u201d Miller. She added: \u201cI think one thing that I take from working with her is I learned how to deal with difficult people, with different types of people.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the reality star was also sentenced for not reporting the $120,000 worth of Australian currency that she had brought into the United States. Along with prison time, she was fined $40,000 along with a $120,000 judgment, and ordered to two years of supervised release.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Mugshots See which stars have been behind bars,
