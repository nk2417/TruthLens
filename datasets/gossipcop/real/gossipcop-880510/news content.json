{"url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/watch-taylor-swift-transform-into-a-zombie", "text": "Let's be honest: a fair number of us were already planning on dressing up as the zombie version of Taylor Swift from her \"Look What You Made Me Do\" music video for Halloween this year. After all, her look is one of the most iconic moments of 2017 so far. But for those of us unskilled in the special effects makeup department, it might prove difficult to recreate. Taylor gave us a little sneak peek into the making of her undead look in a YouTube video\u2014and it honestly seems a little over-the-top, but hey, it's for a good cause. (We're surprised she didn't change the lyrics to \"I'm sorry, Taylor can't come to the phone right now because she's been in the makeup chair for 12 hours.\")\n\nWe're sure there's simpler ways to achieve the effect for Halloween, but T.Swift's video look involved a ton of moss (all over) to get that freshly-arisen-from-the-grave effect, as well as prosthetics for her face, grayish blue contacts for creepy undead eyes, and that dress from \"Out of the Woods.\"\n\nCheck out the preview of Taylor's transformation for yourself:", "images":
