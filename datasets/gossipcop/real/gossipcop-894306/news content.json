The tagline reads, \u201cListen closely, move carefully, and never make a sound. If they can\u2019t hear you, they can\u2019t hunt you.\u201d\n\nThe trailer features a creepy wooden crucifix on a bridge, the family attempting to play Monopoly, and a fire starting when a lantern is knocked over.\n\nKrasinski is directing from a script he wrote, revising the screenplay from Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, which the studio acquired prior to Krasinski and Blunt\u2019s involvement.\n\nKrasinski previously helmed \u201cThe Hollars\u201d and \u201cBrief Interviews With Hideous Men\u201d in 2009. Michael Bay will produce along with his partners Andrew Form and Brad Fuller of Platinum Dunes. Krasinski and his Sunday Night Productions partner Allyson Seeger will serve as executive producers alongside Beck and Woods.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nNoah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds star as the children in a \u201cQuiet Place.\u201d It\u2019s the first time that Krasinski and Blunt have appeared on screen together. The couple married in 2010.\n\nProduction began in September of 2016. Paramount is opening the movie on April 6.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://source.unsplash.com/random/595x333", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/a-quiet-place.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/a-quiet-place.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Mcnary", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/film/news/emily-blunt-john-krasinski-movie-quiet-place-trailer-1202616568/", "title": "Emily Blunt, John Krasinski Stay Silent to Survive in Creepy \u2018A Quiet Place\u2019 Trailer", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Silence equals survival in the first trailer for the supernatural horror film\u00a0\"A Quiet Place,\" starring Emily Blunt and John Krasinski.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Dave McNary", "tags": "A Quiet Place, Emily Blunt, John Krasinski", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Emily Blunt, John Krasinski Stay Silent to Survive in Creepy \u2018A Quiet Place\u2019 Trailer", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/film/news/emily-blunt-john-krasinski-movie-quiet-place-trailer-1202616568/", "description": "Silence equals survival in the first trailer for the supernatural horror film\u00a0\"A Quiet Place,\" starring Emily Blunt and John Krasinski.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/a-quiet-place.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "A Quiet Place trailer"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-16T18:37:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-16T18:38:59+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Silence equals survival in the first trailer for the supernatural horror film\u00a0\"A Quiet Place,\" starring Emily Blunt and John Krasinski.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@Variety_DMcNary", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Emily Blunt, John Krasinski Stay Silent to Survive in Creepy \u2018A Quiet Place\u2019 Trailer", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/a-quiet-place.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510857439.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
