I will forever love Hank and be open but for now we have chosen to go our own ways,\u201d she captioned a photo of herself and Baskett.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m beyond sad and heartbroken because i did believe in forever, that\u2019s why i said yes but unfortunately too much fear has gotten in the way. We are both amazing parents and our kids will be happy n never know the difference other than seeing mama smile,\u201d continued Wilkinson, 32, who shares two children with Baskett: son Hank IV, 8, and daughter Alijah, 3.\n\n\u201cSometimes love looks funny. We are told to make sacrifices in life if it\u2019s true love well in this case it\u2019s me. I want to see happy Hank again\u2026 i miss that,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMarriage was just a piece of paper and a piece of jewelry but our hearts will always be real. U will prob see us together a lot but it\u2019s because there\u2019s no hate.\u201d\n\nWilkinson concluded: \u201cLove wins in this case it\u2019s just looks a little funny. Thank you Hank for a beautiful 8 years of marriage and 2 beautiful kids. I feel so thankful and blessed. \u2764\u201d\n\nOn Monday, the former Playboy model alluded to a split in a series of emotional videos on her Instagram story.\n\n\u201cTen years,\u201d she said, crying. \u201cI did everything I could. It wasn\u2019t good enough. I will always love him and my heart will always remain open for him. I believed in forever, I really did. Guess it\u2019s just not meant to be. I\u2019m so scared, but I have to get strong for my kids \u2014 I will.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you to all my friends and family for supporting me at the moment,\u201d she continued. \u201cEvery little ounce of love helps, thank you. I never thought I\u2019d see the day, really.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Scandal, Lost Trust and Marital Problems: Inside Kendra Wilkinson Baskett and Hank\u2019s Highs & Lows\n\nHours later, Wilkinson shared a photo of what appeared to be an attorney\u2019s office. She captioned the image \u201cHere we go,\u201d adding a sad face emoji.\n\nWilkinson and Baskett, 35, wed in 2009. Their marriage was rocked by scandal in 2014 when Hank allegedly had an affair with a transgender model while Kendra was eight months pregnant. Though the couple remained committed to each another and attempted to make their relationship work in the years since, it hasn\u2019t been easy.\n\nThis week, a source told PEOPLE that their marriage has never been the kind of relationship she envisioned for herself.\n\n\u201cThe marriage was never a walk in the park. They had a lot of issues, whether it was his lack of longevity in his career to his Super Bowl fiasco to her postpartum depression to his infidelity to money and career problems,\u201d said the source. \u201cIt just never was the fairytale she wanted.\u201d", "images":
