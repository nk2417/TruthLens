She announced the news on her Instagram Story with a trio of photos from the intimate ceremony, writing, \u201cSoooo I have a surprise. I got married [\u2026]\n\nWe have a feeling the cute two-piece ensemble won\u2019t be around for long, but Ratajkowski looked fab in the mustard yellow double-breasted jacket, which retails for $129, that she cinched at the waist with a coordinating belt. She paired the top with matching flared trousers that sell for $69 and cute black strappy sandals. But our favorite part of the look was undoubtedly the super chic wide-brimmed black hat with netting that served as a modern take on a veil. The groom, meanwhile, looked hip in a light blue suit jacket, black shirt and scruffy beard.\n\nRelated: Emily Ratajkowski\u2019s Year in Swimsuits Emily Ratajkowski continuously posts photos of herself slaying in different swimsuits on Instagram.
