We may not have known him for long, but he certainly made an impact on us while he was here. Farewell, King Stache.\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nEarlier today, Henry Cavill shaved off his beloved mustache, the source of so much controversy late last year. As a tribute, the Justice League and Mission Impossible star posted a video on his Facebook page to honor his former facial hair.\n\nThe video features Cavill in a bath robe telling fans that King Stache is indeed gone. He shared it to his page with the simple message \u201c#ShavedButNotForgotten.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the full video above!\n\n\u201cI know, it\u2019s hard to recognize me without King Stache,\u201d Cavill said to the camera, before turning his attention to himself in the mirror. \u201cSometimes, I have a hard time recognizing myself.\u201d\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Cavill threw some shade onto the infamous mustache incident. As you surely recall, the actor had the mustache while filming Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout and was brought back to the set of Justice League for extensive reshoots. Since he wasn\u2019t allowed to shave the facial hair due to his obligations to Mission: Impossible, the mustache had to be removed from Justice League via CGI. We all know how that went.\n\nStaring right into the soul of the camera, Cavill said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to admit, this it NOT CGI.\u201d\n\nThe video concludes with Sarah McLachlan\u2019s \u201cI Will Remember You\u201d playing over a montage of photos featuring King Stache. Of course, one of these images is the Cavill\u2019s CGI\u2019d face, showing how terrible it looked without the mustache.\n\nFans have mourned the loss of the beautiful stache all morning. Popular fan artist BossLogic even paid tribute to King Stache by creating a poster, bidding goodbye to the facial hair.\n\nSo long, King Stache. You may be gone, but you\u2019ll never be forgotten.", "images": ["https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/Blooming-Love-Shonen-Jump.jpg?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-KpNhwJ0RxTQPU.gif", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/10/ComicBook-logo_40a31d.png", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/more-recent-sci-fi-movies.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/lego-black-friday.jpeg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/Netflix-Logo-N.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/Dexter-Resurrection-Suit.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/Cartoon-Network-Studios-Logo.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/zodiac-streaming-netflix.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/Ubisoft-Logo.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/themes/comicbook-2024/assets/images/comicbook-logo-white.png", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/eb9b8d3d-fe15-45d5-ab1e-bc17074dabe4.png?w=1200"], "top_img": "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/eb9b8d3d-fe15-45d5-ab1e-bc17074dabe4.png?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Charlie Ridgely", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://comicbook.com/dc/news/henry-cavill-mustache-shaved-video/", "title": "Henry Cavill Bids Goodbye to His Mustache in Hilarious Tribute Video", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Henry Cavill Bids Goodbye to His Mustache in Hilarious Tribute Video", "description": "It\u2019s time to say goodbye to a dear friend.
