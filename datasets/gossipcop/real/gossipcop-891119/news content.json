Each has made statements to Deadline signaling an end to the dispute, and their mutual desire to \u201cmove on.\u201d Ratner will drop the lawsuit he filed in Hawaii imminently.\n\n\u201cI have been honored to represent Melanie Kohler and we are pleased that Mr. Ratner agreed to dismiss this case,\u201d Kohler\u2019s attorney Roberta Kaplan said today. \u201cCases like this are very difficult, especially when the events happened more than a decade ago and memories are cloudy and unclear. The public conversation about this case has become very painful for Melanie. This result will allow Melanie to move on with her life and spend more time with her family.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a win for women everywhere,\u201d attorney Kaplan added. \u201cWe are proud of our client, who stood by her statement and stood up for herself in court, and appreciate Mr. Ratner dismissing this case.\u201d\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy that the matter has been resolved,\u201d said Ratner himself in a statement to Deadline.\n\nKohler made the allegation on Facebook last fall just before a Los Angeles Times story broke accusing Ratner of sexual harassment of six women. The post by Kohler has since been taken down from social media.\n\n\u201cIt is hereby stipulated and agreed by and between the parties hereto, through their respective undersigned counsel, that this action and all claims asserted herein shall be and hereby are dismissed with prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a)(l)(A)(ii) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\u201d the filing authorized today by a federal district judge states (read it here).\u201dThis stipulation disposes of all claims and all parties, with the respective parties to bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs.\u201d\n\nRatner\u2019s attorney Marty Singer says that no monies were exchanged or paid by either party, as a condition of the dismissal, or for any other reason.", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brett-ratner-photo-credit-brigitte-lacombe-copy.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brett-ratner-photo-credit-brigitte-lacombe-copy.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brett-ratner-photo-credit-brigitte-lacombe-copy.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Fleming Jr", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/10/brett-ratner-melanie-kohler-settlement-lawsuit-defamation-sexual-assault-allegation-1202474696/", "title": "Brett Ratner & Accuser Find Common Ground; Defamation Suit Dismissed \u2013 Update", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Melanie Kohler &amp; Brett Ratner have ended their legal battle after she he accused him of sexually assaulting her, and he sued for defamation.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Mike Fleming Jr", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Brett Ratner & Accuser Find Common Ground; Defamation Suit Dismissed \u2013 Update", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/10/brett-ratner-melanie-kohler-settlement-lawsuit-defamation-sexual-assault-allegation-1202474696/", "description": "Melanie Kohler & Brett Ratner have ended their legal battle after she he accused him of sexually assaulting her, and he sued for defamation.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brett-ratner-photo-credit-brigitte-lacombe-copy.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "alt": "Brett Ratner Withdraws Lawsuit, Accuser Withdraws Rape Allegation"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-10-02T19:26:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-10-03T02:36:46+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Melanie Kohler & Brett Ratner have ended their legal battle after she he accused him of sexually assaulting her, and he sued for defamation.", "site": "@Deadline", "creator": "@DeadlineMike", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Brett Ratner & Accuser Find Common Ground; Defamation Suit Dismissed \u2013 Update", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brett-ratner-photo-credit-brigitte-lacombe-copy.jpg?w=1024"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1538508403.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
