As the Big Little Lies star, 50, stepped out of the Beverly Hills Hotel on December 20, NBA star Baron Davis was doting on her. An eyewitness tells Us Weekly that following a lunch date where the pair were \u201ctalking, laughing and having a great time,\u201d the athlete, 38, carried the actress\u2019 purse as the duo packed on PDA. Although Dern, who divorced Ben Harper in 2013 after eight years of marriage, was \u201ctrying to remain incognito,\u201d says the observer, they \u201cwere kissing and touching and were all over each other.\u201d\n\nRelated: Unlikely Celebrity Couples They dated?!

Check out these unexpected celebrity romances.\n\nThe duo, said the eyewitness, looked \u201cinfatuated with each other\u201d and \u201cvery much like a new couple in love.\u201d\n\nSince her split from Harper, Dern has remained relatively mum about her romantic life, although she was reportedly linked to Common last year. Davis\u2019 wife of three years, Isabella Brewster, filed for divorce in June and requested primary physical and joint legal custody of their 3-year-old and 1-year-old children.\n\nRelated: Celebrities Dating Athletes They sure like their players!

As the Goliath actor, 62, briefly walked behind Dern on his way to the stage to accept an award, the exes appeared to avoid eye contact and Dern briefly looked down. Dern opened up about her 1999 split from Thornton \u2013 when he famously left her for Angelina Jolie \u2013 during a past interview with Talk magazine. \u201cI left our home to work on a movie, and while I was away, my boyfriend got married, and I\u2019ve never heard from him again,\u201d she said, via ABC News. \u201cIt\u2019s like a sudden death. For no one has there been any closure or clarity.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
