HBO promises \u201crelationships will fray, loyalties will erode[, and] the potential for emotional and bodily injury shall loom,\u201d in the drama\u2019s sophomore year. Yet, no one wants to see these women's loyalties \u201cerode,\u201d since the entire point of \u201cWhat You Need\u201d is that the trauma of toxicity like Perry has created unbreakable friendships. It\u2019s unlikely fans want to see these women\u2019s romantic relationships fray, either, since they were never the point of the show anyway. Please raise your hand if you seriously care about the future of Madeline\u2019s oftentimes tepid marriage with husband Nice Guy Ed Mackenzie (Adam Scott). Bueller? Bueller? In that same vein, absolutely no Lies fan wants to see either of these five starring women put into \u201cbodily harm\u201d \u00e0 la the dead as a doornail Perry.", "images": ["https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/20d/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1902306/image.jpg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d68e2ddc49f6065953daf57eac5b849a.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/b3658fb2d9482c50df8996241fb2b67d.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/9aa89696be7da8b249e2ee2622a111e9.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/1ce585852b9e9a8cba36762b911e0f5f.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/cda4774d79df76d9c5ab2dfba3784155.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/90e3b0501ff143bd058ecb3f754a4430.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/c5a8ae3dd50e6ebe17044593c2c7ee0c.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/6a9d712b4b1480df334054a94146cc34.png"], "top_img": "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/20d/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1902306/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Newman-B...", "Rachel Choy", "Taryn Finley", "Alicia Lansom", "Banseka Kayembe", "Tess Garcia", "Big Little Lies Season Confirmed", "Ruin Perfect Finale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/12/184502/big-little-lies-season-2-renewed-ending-changes", "title": "Big Little Lies Season 2 Confirmed, Ruin Perfect Finale", "meta_data": {"title": "Big Little Lies Season 2 Confirmed, Ruin Perfect Finale", "description": "Sorry to burst your bubble of more beautiful beachside homes and endless white wine.", "og": {"url": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/12/184502/big-little-lies-season-2-renewed-ending-changes", "title": "Why The World Doesn't Need A \"Big Little Lies\" Season 2", "description": "Sorry to burst your bubble of more beautiful beachside homes and endless white wine.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/20d/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1902306/image.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/20d/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1902306/image.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1050}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Why The World Doesn't Need A \"Big Little Lies\" Season 2", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@refinery29", "description": "Sorry to burst your bubble of more beautiful beachside homes and endless white wine.", "image": "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/20d/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1902306/image.jpg"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/20d/112,0,1776,2400/x,80/1902306/image.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 155023867867753, "pages": "86973707921,587074007996399,269626263209765,509115739117952,1562713254009921,583745561686633,656112191237463,284423314989162,974273182666651,192477361634120"}, "article": {"publisher": "refinery29"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#fd5b4e", "news_keywords": "big little lies renewed, big little lies canceled, Big Little Lies Season 2 differences, Big Little Lies Season 2 explained, bll Season 2 explained, Big Little Lies Season 2 cast, bll cast, bll season 2 cast, Big Little Lies Season 2 director, bll season 2 director, bll season 2 plot, bll season 2 explainer, Big Little Lies Season 2 plot, big little lies finale recap, Big Little Lies Season 1 finale explained, Big Little Lies Season 1 finale explained meaning", "p": {"domain_verify": "b10faeb45f92f5ebf0073a215d615ea9"}, "entry_template": "entry.article", "author": "Ariana Romero"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513573200.0, "source": "https://www.refinery29.com", "summary": ""}
