(Al Seib / Los Angeles Times)\n\nWith stories about women allegedly harassed by Harvey Weinstein surfacing all around her, Oscar winner Lupita Nyong\u2019o decided she couldn\u2019t keep her own story squashed down any longer.\n\nShe thought the things that had happened were unique to her, not a larger pattern of what she on Thursday called \u201csinister behavior.\u201d She blamed herself for much of it.\n\n\u201cI had shelved my experience with Harvey far in the recesses of my mind, joining in the conspiracy of silence that has allowed this predator to prowl for so many years,\u201d Nyong\u2019o wrote in an op-ed for the New York Times.\n\nThe \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d actress was still at Yale School of Drama when she and Weinstein crossed paths at a 2011 awards ceremony in Berlin, where he was introduced to the then-aspiring actress as \u201cthe most powerful producer in Hollywood.\u201d Dinner companions told her he was a good man to know in the biz, but someone to be \u201ccareful\u201d around because he could be a bully, she wrote.\n\nThe interactions that followed between her and the producer went back and forth between seemingly appropriate and uncomfortably inappropriate, Nyong\u2019o said.\n\nThe invitation to screen a movie with Weinstein and his children at his Connecticut home turned into a restaurant lunch where he tried to bully her into drinking alcohol, she wrote, followed by him cutting short her viewing of the movie after 15 minutes and taking her to his bedroom where he offered to give her a massage. She said she flipped the situation around.\n\n\u201cI began to massage his back to buy myself time to figure out how to extricate myself from this undesirable situation,\u201d the actress said. Then he wanted to take off his pants, she wrote.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t make it to see a production she was in, but invited her to bring anyone she wanted to see a staged reading of \u201cFinding Neverland,\u201d one of his. Dinner followed, with her friends relegated to a non-Harvey table.\n\n\u201cThe talk was shop the whole time and Harvey held court with ease. He was charming and funny once more, and I felt confused about the discomfort I had previously experienced,\u201d Nyong\u2019o said.\n\nLupita N\u2019yongo accepts the supporting actress Academy Award for her work in \u201c12 Years a Slave\u201d on March 2, 2014. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)\n\nA couple of months later, he invited her to a screening of \u201cW.E.\u201d followed by a trip to the Tribeca Grill, which she said she assumed would be another group meal. It was not. His assistants, she said, had seemed uncomfortable as they set up the logistics with her.\n\n\u201cBefore the starters arrived, he announced: \u2018Let\u2019s cut to the chase. I have a private room upstairs where we can have the rest of our meal.\u2019 I was stunned,\u201d Nyong\u2019o wrote. \u201cI told him I preferred to eat in the restaurant. He told me not to be so na\u00efve. If I wanted to be an actress, then I had to be willing to do this sort of thing. He said he had dated Famous Actress X and Y and look where that had gotten them.\u201d\n\nShe declined, and his tone changed, she said. As he escorted her out, sans meal, she checked in with him to make sure they were still \u201cgood\u201d after she\u2019d said no.\n\nHis response, according to the actress: \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t know about your career, but you\u2019ll be fine,\u2019 he said. It felt like both a threat and a reassurance at the same time; of what, I couldn\u2019t be sure.\u201d\n\nThey didn\u2019t cross paths again until the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival, which she was attending in support of \u201c12 Years a Slave.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt an after-party, he found me and evicted whoever was sitting next to me to sit beside me,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe said he couldn\u2019t believe how fast I had gotten to where I was, and that he had treated me so badly in the past. He was ashamed of his actions and he promised to respect me moving forward. I said thank you and left it at that. But I made a quiet promise to myself to never ever work with Harvey Weinstein.\u201d\n\nOur business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public. That\u2019s why someone can have the audacity to invite you to their home or hotel and you show up. \u2014 Lupita Nyong\u2019o\n\nThe following year, after her Oscar win, he tried to get her in one of his films, showering her with talk of a star-vehicle film in the offing for her later if she\u2019d first take a role in a Weinstein Co. movie she\u2019d already turned down. She held firm.\n\nWhen she first met the now-disgraced producer, she wrote, she was \u201centering into a community that Harvey Weinstein had been in, and even shaped, long before I got there. He was one of the first people I met in the industry, and he told me, \u2018This is the way it is.\u2019 And wherever I looked, everyone seemed to be bracing themselves and dealing with him, unchallenged.\u201d\n\nSince then, she said, she hasn\u2019t encountered treatment like that from anyone else. Still, she talked about the often-blurry lines in the workplace known as Hollywood.\n\n\u201cOur business is complicated because intimacy is part and parcel of our profession; as actors we are paid to do very intimate things in public,\u201d wrote Nyong\u2019o, who is now 34. \u201cThat\u2019s why someone can have the audacity to invite you to their home or hotel and you show up. Precisely because of this we must stay vigilant and ensure that the professional intimacy is not abused.\u201d", "images":
