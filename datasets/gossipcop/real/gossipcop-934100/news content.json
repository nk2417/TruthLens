The 48-year-old entertainer and Fallon competed against each other to see who could better \"fast dance\" to slow songs from the '70s.\n\nAll picked by The Roots' Questlove, the two took turns busting moves to the least danceable jams with the best fastest dancer winning. Dressed in a body-hugging red gown with sequins and a thigh-high slit, J.Lo took the stage first and danced to \"Three Times a Lady\" by Commodores and then to Richard Harris' \"MacArthur Park.\"\n\nOn his end, Fallon shimmied to \"Babe\" by Styx.
