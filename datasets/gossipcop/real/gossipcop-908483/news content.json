As Brie was going for a pin, Maryse countered and grabbed her opponent's tights for good measure to get that extra bit of leverage. Brie was unable to kick out before the referee counted to three.\n\nUproxx's Brandon Stroud is less than impressed with Brie's in-ring technique:\n\nThe married couples faced off for the first time in a tag team match on the heels of Miz beating Bryan at SummerSlam in August.\n\nMiz enlisted some help from his bride in that match, as Maryse handed him brass knuckles from the crowd, which he used to knock out Bryan and pick up the victory.\n\nWith The A-Lister gloating about his win over Bryan, Brie returned on SmackDown Live and attacked The Miz by punching him square in the face.\n\nBy virtue of Brie evening the odds, Bryan announced that SmackDown Live general manager Paige granted him and his wife a tag team match against Miz and Maryse at Hell in a Cell.\n\nMiz and Bryan have been at odds since the latter came to WWE eight years ago. The Miz served as Bryan's pro on the first season of NXT in 2010, and they simply never saw eye-to-eye because of their status as polar opposites.\n\nTheir rivalry grew in recent years, especially when The Miz verbally eviscerated Bryan on Talking Smack in 2016.\n\nAt that time, Bryan was not medically cleared to compete, so he was serving as the general manager of SmackDown Live.\n\nBryan and Miz called each other cowards, and while it didn't initially look like there would ever be a payoff, The Beard's return to the ring this year changed that.\n\nAdding Brie and Maryse to the mix made for an intriguing wrinkle since they used to be close friends until a business deal went wrong, as highlighted on the E! reality show Total Divas.\n\nThe Miz and Maryse are no strangers to tag team competition, as they faced John Cena and Nikki Bella at WrestleMania 33 last year. While Miz and Maryse lost that match, they shined during the buildup, just as they did leading to Hell in a Cell.\n\nSunday's match was largely about furthering the issue between Bryan and Miz without forcing them into another singles match against each other.\n\nThey do have a singles bout looming at Super Show-Down in Australia in October, though, with a shot at the WWE Championship hanging in the balance.\n\nHell in a Cell was a fine tuneup, and The Miz now has momentum on his side after scoring the victory alongside Maryse.", "images":
