And evidently, that displeasure extends to denying photo ops to Republican Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan.\n\nRogen recounted the story Friday while on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\u201d The \u201cPreacher\u201d co-creator, as a longtime proponent and advocate for Alzheimer\u2019s research, had been asked to speak about brain health at Mitt Romney\u2019s annual summit. While there, he was approached by two \u201cvery nice,\u201d \u201cvery white\u201d young men who asked for a photo.\n\n\u201cThen they said, \u2018Our dad wants to meet you,\u2019 and I turned around and Paul Ryan was walking towards me,\u201d Rogen said. \u201cHe came over and grabbed my hand and I\u2019m just shaking his hand, I don\u2019t know what to do, and he said, \u2018Can I have a picture with you?'\u201d With Ryan\u2019s kids still present, Rogen said, \u201cNo way, man!\u201d and went to admonish him for the Trump administration\u2019s actions.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t stop,\u201d Rogen added, \u201cand I said, \u2018Furthermore, I hate what you\u2019re doing to the country at this moment and I count the days till you no longer have one iota of the power that you currently have.\u2019 And I look over and his kids are still standing right there.\u201d\n\nHe continued by saying that he feels \u201cvery conflicted\u201d about the situation: \u201cIt\u2019s not their fault,\u201d he said, \u201cbut at the same time, they should probably learn that if they like a movie or song, the person that made that probably doesn\u2019t like their dad that much.\u201d\n\nWatch the full interview above.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rogen-ryan.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://source.unsplash.com/random/595x333", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rogen-ryan.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Nyren", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/seth-rogen-paul-ryan-rejected-photo-request-1202855903/", "title": "Seth Rogen Says He Rejected Paul Ryan\u2019s Request for a Photo", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Rogen shared the story on \"The Late Show\" Friday night.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Erin Nyren", "tags": "Paul Ryan, Seth Rogen", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Seth Rogen Says He Rejected Paul Ryan\u2019s Request for a Photo", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/seth-rogen-paul-ryan-rejected-photo-request-1202855903/", "description": "Rogen shared the story on \"The Late Show\" Friday night.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rogen-ryan.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Seth Rogen Says He Rejected Paul Ryan's Request for a Photo"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-23T18:03:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-23T18:03:16+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rogen shared the story on \"The Late Show\" Friday night.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/ecnyren", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Seth Rogen Says He Rejected Paul Ryan\u2019s Request for a Photo", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rogen-ryan.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529776996.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
