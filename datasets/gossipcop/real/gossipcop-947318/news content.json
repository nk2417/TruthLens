By Wednesday, all of that had changed.\n\nDuring the reunion show, which was taped Aug. 28 and weeks after cameras stopped rolling on the Sayulita, Mexico, beach set, Jordan pitched his and Jenna\u2019s TV wedding to franchise host Chris Harrison: June 9, on the beaches of Paradise with Harrison officiating.\n\n\u201cWe have a date for the wedding, we have to start planning that,\u201d Jordan had happily told The Hollywood Reporter after the taping of their plans. \u201cWe want to bring our families closer together and we have to figure out a living space. We met on June 9 and it\u2019s her birthday. The network brought us together, so why not bring us even closer together?\u201d\n\nShortly before the episode aired, however, franchise spoiler blogger Reality Steve published a report accusing Jenna of cheating on Jordan. The report included screengrabs of text messages apparently sent by Jenna, where she says she and Jordan \u201caren\u2019t together for real\u201d and that she is faking it for her business (she runs a social media management company). \u201cI don\u2019t even like him, let alone love him. I\u2019m better than him and once I\u2019m able to I\u2019ll break it off for good and make up some story and make up some story to make him look bad if it will make you feel better,\u201d she writes in the messages to a man claiming to be in a relationship with her.\n\nHours after the Bachelor in Paradise reunion episode aired, both Jenna and Jordan spoke out about the accusations. Jenna denied the content in the text messages, but Jordan said he was blindsided.\n\n\u201cI am aware of the allegations being made against me and they are simply untrue,\u201d Jenna told People in a statement. \u201cI am choosing to focus on my relationship right now. Thank you for respecting my privacy at this time.\u201d\n\nJordan, however, said he felt \u201cweak in the knees\u201d and like \u201cI have rocks in my stomach\u201d after hearing the story, which he got a warning of on Twitter.\n\n\u201cOn Monday, I saw something someone posted on Twitter \u2014 that somebody was going to be roasted the next night,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cJenna called me and said she was very anxious about this Twitter post. I talked to her in the middle of the night last night. I said, \u2018Don\u2019t hype yourself up, don\u2019t worry, you have nothing to worry about.\u2019 I tried to calm her. I went back to bed for a few hours, woke up, had my coffee and she called me again and said she was anxious and felt sick to her stomach.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cShe\u2019s in New York. I told her to keep calm. I thought she was just being nervous for no reason. Then I was driving back to Central Florida from Miami and I started getting calls from castmates like Chris Randone. I started getting screenshots sent to me. I didn\u2019t know what to think. I sank in my seat.\u201d\n\nJordan told the magazine that he believes the report: \u201cI know my Jenna, and I read those texts and in my heart, I know it\u2019s her. She was saying she didn\u2019t do it, but hinting towards the fact that there\u2019s a possibility that it happened. In all reality, I don\u2019t expect her to own it.\u201d\n\nJordan said they had been in the midst of planning an engagement party, but that this news is now \u201ckilling\u201d him. \u201cI would never have expected this,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel sick about it. I just don\u2019t understand why someone would say that they\u2019re better than me and have ill intentions. If this whole thing sticks, and it\u2019s true, I will be hurt much more than the depths of romance. I will be hurt as a person and as a friend. There are so many layers to a relationship and right now I feel all of them peeling back.\u201d\n\nJordan, a model from Florida, broke out as a franchise face after his dramatic stint on Becca Kufrin\u2019s recent cycle of The Bachelorette. He quickly earned \u201cvillain\u201d status for feuding with his fellow castmates, most notably co-star David Ravitz. Jordan and David continued their fighting when they returned on Bachelor in Paradise, but Jordan\u2019s storyline quickly turned to one of romance once he and Jenna began dating.\n\n\u201cThis was not a TV romance,\u201d he told People of his relationship with Jenna, who hails from Arie Luyendyk Jr.\u2019s season of The Bachelor. \u201cThis was real. And whether you like me or not, I deserve love. I found it, and this is what happened. So for the sake of anyone who\u2019s ever been in love, be understanding.\u201d\n\nHe also couldn\u2019t answer whether or not they are still engaged. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what piece to pick up or how to put it back,\u201d he said.\n\nBut that indecisiveness didn\u2019t last long. Later on Wednesday, Jordan announced that he had broken off the engagement and \u201cremoved\u201d himself from the relationship with Jenna in a lengthy Instagram post.\n\n\u201cTo think, to feel, to fall. These emotions interact with experiences and people, when you find a person you think about them, you feel when they feel and sometimes you fall,\u201d he began the post. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in love with even the experiences you\u2019ve had with them it\u2019s something to respect. Being careless with someone that you give your heart to and reach milestones with isn\u2019t sensible no matter what the terms may be. I have not had an easy life and having struggles allows me to grab onto tough times and discard them from my path.\u201d\n\nContinuing, \u201cI deal with unreasonable circumstances reasonably and have come to terms with a decision to remove myself from the relationship, it breaks my heart to think, feel and fall for this. It\u2019s dropped me. Fumbling emotions and being understanding is not easy. I\u2019ll be taking time to pursue my inner peace and she will always have me to talk to, if you\u2019ve reached out to me, allow me time. Thank you to those that have.\u201d\n\nJenna continued to deny the texts, calling them \u201ccompletely fabricated\u201d in her own Instagram statement, and said she is seeking legal advice to \u201cinvestigate this hurtful and fraudulent attack on my character.\u201d\n\nShe wrote in her post: \u201cI want to start by saying those texts were completely fabricated, and I never sent them to anyone. I did not cheat on Jordan, and I have nothing to hide. I have been extremely open and vulnerable throughout this whole process. I was looking for love, and I found it. I was excited to share this journey with all of you. I am hurt by these fake texts, and that anyone would believe this story so quickly without proof. I have an attorney helping me investigate this hurtful and fraudulent attack on my character. We are evaluating all legal remedies available to punish those responsible.\u201d (See both posts below.)\n\nJordan and Jenna were one of two couples to walk away from Bachelor in Paradise with an engagement. Chris Randone and Krystal Nielson revealed they are moving forward with wedding plans, albeit slowly, and two other couples \u2014 Kevin Wendt and Astrid Loch, and Kendall Long and Joe Amabile \u2014 ended the show with a relationship commitment. Joe, who was nicknamed \u201cGrocery Store Joe\u201d after he went viral over his night-one Bachelorette elimination, will next be seen on ABC\u2019s Dancing With the Stars.\n\nBachelor in Paradise now boasts two marriages, one engagement and two relationships in five seasons. That success rate is higher than 22 seasons of The Bachelor, which has produced two marriages and one engagement. ABC has yet to comment.\n\nSept. 12, 12 p.m. Updated with Jordan\u2019s Instagram post.\n\n2:30 p.m. Updated with Jenna\u2019s Instagram post.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/jordan_jenna_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/jordan_jenna_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackie Strause", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/bachelor-paradise-couple-jordan-kimball-jenna-cooper-respond-cheating-report-1142561/", "title": "\u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 Couple Calls off Engagement After Cheating Report", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "'Bachelor in Paradise' couple Jordan Kimball and Jenna Cooper respond to a cheating report after announcing their engagement on the ABC show's finale.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Jackie Strause", "tags": "Bachelor In Paradise", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 Couple Calls off Engagement After Cheating Report", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/bachelor-paradise-couple-jordan-kimball-jenna-cooper-respond-cheating-report-1142561/", "description": "'Bachelor in Paradise' couple Jordan Kimball and Jenna Cooper respond to a cheating report after announcing their engagement on the ABC show's finale.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/jordan_jenna_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "'Bachelor in Paradise' Couple Jordan Kimball, Jenna Cooper End"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-09-12T06:04:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-09-12T17:21:11+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Bachelor in Paradise' couple Jordan Kimball and Jenna Cooper respond to a cheating report after announcing their engagement on the ABC show's finale.", "site": "@thr", "creator": "@jackiedstrause", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 Couple Calls off Engagement After Cheating Report", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/jordan_jenna_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1536732298.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
