Renee Zellweger\u2019s team is denouncing allegations that she had inappropriate encounters with Harvey Weinstein in order to escalate her career.\n\nThe claims came to light in a class-action lawsuit that six unnamed women recently filed against Weinstein, alleging that Zellweger, 48, and Charlize Theron both ascended in their professional endeavors by performing \u201csexual favors\u201d for Weinstien, 65.\n\nRelated: Channing Tatum, Laura Dern, Jane Fonda and More Speak Out Against Harvey Weinstein Amid Sexual Misconduct Scandal Channing Tatum, Laura Dern, Jane Fonda and more stars are speaking out against film producer Harvey Weinstein in the wake of his sexual misconduct scandal \u2014 read more\n\n\u201cIf Harvey said that, he\u2019s full of shit,\u201d a rep for the Bridget Jones actress, who has starred in several films produced by the former studio exec, including Cold Mountain which she won an Oscar for in 2004, told Us Weekly in a statement on Wednesday, December 7.\n\nWeinstein responded to the claims in a statement to Us on Monday, December 11: \u201cMr. Weinstein vehemently denies these accusations and has never stated he slept with any of them. It\u2019s ridiculous that anyone would believe these talented women, Academy Award winners, provided sexual favors in exchange for roles they earned based on their talent and brilliant work. It\u2019s simply not true.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the former Miramax producer made headlines in October after nearly 30 years of sexual assault and abuse allegations came to light in expo\u015bes published by The New York Times and The New Yorker. North of 60 women have accused Weinstein of misconduct to date and he has since been faced with several lawsuits and expelled from the Television Academy.

Alyssa Milano, who costarred as a judge alongside Chapman on Project Runway: All Stars, gave an update on the British fashion designer, 41, during an appearance on Megan Kelly Today on Wednesday, December 6.\n\n\u201cGeorgina is doing very well. She\u2019s an amazing mother. She\u2019s an amazing woman,\u201d the Charmed alum, 44, said. \u201cI think her priority right now is focusing on how to raise those two children to the best of her capacity, given the situation. She goes through very dark times. She\u2019s very sad. This is not easy for her, but I have no doubt that not only will she come out on the other side of this, but she deserves to. She\u2019s a good woman.\u201d\n\nRelated: Biggest Celebrity Cheating Scandals Ever!
