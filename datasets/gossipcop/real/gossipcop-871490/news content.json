Regan was unable to return to reprise the role due to scheduling. (She\u2019s a series regular on TNT\u2019s The Last Ship, starring Grey\u2019s grad Eric Dane.)\n\nSpencer, who is slated to return to NBC\u2019s Timeless for its 10-episode sophomore run next summer, will appear in a multiple-episode arc in the veteran medical drama\u2019s upcoming 14th season.\n\nRegan originally guest-starred in a season 13 episode that included flashbacks as Owen\u2019s (Kevin McKidd) younger sister. While serving in the Army, Megan was romantically paired with Owen\u2019s best friend Nathan (Martin Henderson), and after learning he cheated on her, took off in a helicopter. She was presumed dead after the helicopter went missing. The season 13 finale revealed that Owen\u2019s sister is indeed alive.\n\nMegan\u2019s return sets the stage for an awkward love triangle in season 14, as Nathan and Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) finally took a major step forward in their burgeoning relationship.\n\nSpencer\u2019s casting comes as Grey\u2019s Anatomy is poised to further explore Owen\u2019s and Amelia\u2019s (Caterina Scorsone) dynamic, as the married couple spent the bulk of last season separated, as well as Owen\u2019s relationship with Megan.\n\nIn addition to Spencer, former Grey\u2019s Anatomy series regular Kim Raver is set to reprise her role as Dr. Teddy Altman, Owen\u2019s former Army buddy, in season 14.\n\nSpencer\u2019s credits include Rectify, Suits and Mad Men. She\u2019s repped by WME, Untitled Entertainment and Hansen Jacobson.\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy returns Sept. 28 at 8 p.m. with a two-hour season 14 premiere.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gettyimages-819714530_0.jpg?w=1294&h=733&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gettyimages-819714530_0.jpg?w=1294&h=733&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Goldberg", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/greys-anatomy-adds-abigail-spencer-key-recasting-1026817/", "title": "\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Adds Abigail Spencer in Key Recasting", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The 'Timeless' star will replace Bridget Regan and play Kevin McKidd's on-screen sister.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Lesley Goldberg", "tags": "Abigail Spencer, Fall TV Preview, Grey's Anatomy", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Adds Abigail Spencer in Key Recasting", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/greys-anatomy-adds-abigail-spencer-key-recasting-1026817/", "description": "The 'Timeless' star will replace Bridget Regan and play Kevin McKidd's on-screen sister.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gettyimages-819714530_0.jpg?w=1294&h=733&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 580, "alt": "'Grey's Anatomy' Adds Abigail Spencer Key Recasting"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-04T09:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-29T06:25:39+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 'Timeless' star will replace Bridget Regan and play Kevin McKidd's on-screen sister.", "site": "@thr", "creator": "@snoodit", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Adds Abigail Spencer in Key Recasting", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gettyimages-819714530_0.jpg?w=1294&h=733&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501837200.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
