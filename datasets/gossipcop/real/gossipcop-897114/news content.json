One of her attackers was a man whose advances she had rejected earlier in the night, and in the backseat of their car he raped her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI silently thanked God as I was slammed onto the sidewalk, realizing that it was finally over,\u201d Rivera writes. \u201cBut the damage was done.\u201d\n\nThe singer recalls feeling as if she was slowly being destroyed, but feared fighting back and ultimately leaving her children without a mother. Ashamed but relieved to be alive, Rivera vowed to never tell anyone of her ordeal.\n\nBut even amid the darkest moments of her life, there was light. In her book, Jenni reveals her one true love, Fernando -- the \u201cPinche Pel\u00f3n\u201d that stole her heart. Known as \u201cEl Corredor,\u201d the diva\u2019s love was a former promoter for the 'Que Buena de Los Angeles' radio station.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith him, Rivera says, she not only experienced her first orgasm -- at the age of 33 -- but also experimented with drugs, specifically marijuana. Still, Fernando\u2019s drug addiction would eventually hinder the possibility of a happy ending, leading Rivera to eventually marry Esteban Loaiza instead.\n\nIn the 286 pages that the autobiography spans -- including photos and manuscripts -- the star also discusses in depth some of her most widely publicized experiences, including the moment she found out her first husband had raped her sister and eldest daughter.\n\n\u201cUnbreakable\u201d (\u201cInquebrantable\u201d in Spanish) was written by the singer herself over the course of several years in the form of a diary, with a final entry written six days before her tragic death on Dec. 9, 2012. The autobiography was released -- in both Spanish and English -- Tuesday, July 2, on what would\u2019ve been Jenni\u2019s 44th birthday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCORRECTION: This article initially misstated Rivera's birth date as June 2.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559d3cdd1700001600b065cf.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1200_630", "https://i.huffpost.com/gen/1223623/thumbs/o-JENNI-RIVERA-LIBRO-570.jpg?16", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/691c87541700009d2b9c5f37.jpg?ops=50_50"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reporter", "Whitney Snyder", "Editor-In-Chief Huffpost"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jenni-rivera-unbreakable-autobiography_n_3536749", "title": "Jenni Rivera's 'Unbreakable' Autobiography Reveals Star's Darkest Moment And Only True Love", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "Jenni Rivera's Autobiography Reveals Star's Darkest Moment", "keywords": "latino voices,Jenni Rivera,Latino Entertainment,Latino Voices,Latino Voices", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "og": {"title": "Jenni Rivera's Autobiography Reveals Star's Darkest Moment", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1200_630", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1200_630", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jenni-rivera-unbreakable-autobiography_n_3536749", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Jenni Rivera's Autobiography Reveals Star's Darkest Moment"}, "article": {"tag": "latino voices,Jenni Rivera,Latino Entertainment,Latino Voices,Latino Voices", "section": "Latino Voices", "published_time": "2013-07-02T22:40:51Z", "modified_time": "2017-12-07T03:08:56Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@LatinoVoices", "title": "Jenni Rivera's Autobiography Reveals Star's Darkest Moment", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-entry.jpg?ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "description": "Jenni Rivera's Autobiography Reveals Star's Darkest Moment"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5bae8b5be4b006f4f19725b7", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "bingbot": "noarchive", "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1372737600.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
