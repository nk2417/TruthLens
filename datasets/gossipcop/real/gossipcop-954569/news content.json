A source told PEOPLE at the time, \u201cThey\u2019ve been friends for a while and now they\u2019ve been hanging out and spending more time together. They\u2019re flirty.\u201d\n\nRachel Murray/Getty\n\nAdams revealed more about their romance on Chatter, admitting they first made contact on social media when he \u201cslid\u201d into her DM\u2019s, explaining they struck a conversation when he referenced Harry Potter while on The Bachelorette.\n\nThe two recently celebrated Adams\u2019 34th birthday in early May with Hyland sharing a sweet message to her boyfriend on Instagram in which they cuddled in bed.\n\nThe Modern Family actress shared the photo she said was taken shortly after the couple said \u201cI love you\u201d for the first time.\n\n\u201cThis picture was taken three days after three words were exchanged. My smile has only grown, my heart has only deepened, and my world has only gotten better ever since,\u201d she wrote.\n\nHyland, 27, called herself the \u201cluckiest woman in the world\u201d thanks to Adams.\n\n\u201cYou are the most phenomenal man I have ever met and I am the luckiest woman in the world to have you by my side,\u201d she continued. \u201cThank you for calling me baby even when I\u2019m acting crazy. Happy Birthday Llama!\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?
