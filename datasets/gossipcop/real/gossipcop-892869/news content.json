I really hoped to achieve this in time to be able to sing in Paris; however, and much to my chagrin, this hasn't been possible and my doctors have advised me to continue on vocal rest for the time being,\" she revealed.\n\nShakira, who was supposed to kick off her tour in Cologne, Germany, on Wednesday, explained that she will also have to reschedule concerts on Nov. 10 and 11 in Paris, France, Nov. 12 in Antwerp, Belgium, and Nov. 14 in Amsterdam, Netherlands.\n\n\"At the moment I'm concentrating on full recovery to be able to share with you all this show that I've so enjoyed preparing and of which I am very proud. I'm anxious to get back on stage and be at 100% for all of you,\" she wrote on Twitter. \"Again, I thank all of you from the bottom of my heart for all the support you've shown me these days and which has helped keep me afloat in what has been a difficult time. God willing we will see each other soon for the kickoff of my tour.\"\n\n\"Sending all my love and gratitude, Shakira,\" she concluded.\n\nShakira revealed on Tuesday that she had strained her vocal cords just days before starting her world tour. The mother of two couldn't have looked more excited about the tour in Instagram videos of her rehearsals.\n\nSee more on Shakira in the video below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/gettyimages-107116719.jpg?h=05a859a0", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-05/et_shaikra_052617_1280.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/gettyimages-107116719.jpg?h=05a859a0&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-11/gettyimages-107116719.jpg?h=05a859a0&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/gettyimages-107116719.jpg?h=05a859a0", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/shakira-postpones-el-dorado-world-tour-opening-dates-continue-vocal-rest-90868", "title": "Shakira Postpones El Dorado World Tour Opening Dates to 'Continue on Vocal Rest'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/gettyimages-107116719.jpg?h=05a859a0", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 40-year-old singer announced on Tuesday that she had strained her vocal cords.", "title": "Shakira Postpones El Dorado World Tour Opening Dates to 'Continue on Vocal Rest'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/shakira-postpones-el-dorado-world-tour-opening-dates-continue-vocal-rest-90868", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 40-year-old singer announced on Tuesday that she had strained her vocal cords.", "twitter": {"description": "The 40-year-old singer announced on Tuesday that she had strained her vocal cords.", "title": "Shakira Postpones El Dorado World Tour Opening Dates to 'Continue on Vocal Rest'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/shakira-postpones-el-dorado-world-tour-opening-dates-continue-vocal-rest-90868", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/gettyimages-107116719.jpg?h=05a859a0", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Shakira Postpones El Dorado World Tour Opening Dates to 'Continue on Vocal Rest' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, Music, News, Shakira", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
