I\u2019m a roller coaster of emotions & have said things I shouldn\u2019t have. Honestly, Tristan cheating on me & humiliating me wasn\u2019t such a shock as the first time.\u2026What\u2019s been harder & more painful is being hurt by someone so close to me. Someone whom I love & treat like a little sister. But Jordyn is not to be blamed for the breakup of my family. This was Tristan\u2019s fault.\u2026I have to move on with my life & count my blessings, my family, my health & my beautiful baby True.\u201d\n\nMarch 16, 2019\n\nKhloe sweetly says her drama with Tristan will never come between their individual relationships with their daughter, True.\n\nMarch 27, 2019\n\nA Keeping Up With the Kardashians show teaser reveals they got (almost) the whole relationship fallout on camera.\n\nApril 16, 2019\n\nKhlo\u00e9 and Tristan cohost True\u2019s 1st birthday party, and it\u2019s massively awk.\n\nJune 2, 2019\n\n\n\nKhlo\u00e9 tells her bestie Malika Haqq on an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians that Tristan\u2019s cheating \u201cdemolished\u201d their relationship, even though she loves him.\n\n\u201cAre you still in love?\u201d Malika asks.\n\n\u201cI am in love.

But I\u2019m not going to force that,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 says. \u201cHe counts\u2014\u2018It\u2019s been seven months.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018So it\u2019s been seven months.\u2019 I\u2019m allowed to do things when I want to do it. But he also needs to know: \u2018Your one stupid weekend or whatever you did, look what it did to three years of a relationship. It just demolished it.

Per a source, \u201cKhlo\u00e9 doesn\u2019t have bad or negative feelings toward Tristan at this point.

Even though she and Tristan aren\u2019t together, he agreed to be her sperm donor. \u201cTristan will do whatever I want to do,\u201d she told her sisters\u2014who were less than enthused about the whole idea\u2014and later in the ep, Tristan seemed eager to go through with it.\n\nJune 9, 2020\n\nAt a friend\u2019s b-day party, Tristan and Khloe look\u2026extremely cozy, let\u2019s say. They\u2019re recording everyone singing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d on their phones and his arm is wrapped around her. She\u2019s leaning into him. They look like they\u2019re together, TBH. Fans are immediately theorizing about a reunion.\n\nAugust 5, 2020\n\nYep: Apparently, the two are back together. \u201cKhlo\u00e9 is hopeful that Tristan has changed for good and will continue to grow and be the great and loyal partner that he has been throughout their time together during the [coronavirus] quarantine,\u201d a source tells Us Weekly, and \u201cKhlo\u00e9 would love to give daughter True a sibling because she is at the perfect age.\u201d\n\nNovember 2, 2020\n\nThe two dress in matching Halloween costumes with their daughter (Marc Antony and Cleopatra) but Khlo\u00e9 shuts down rumors that she\u2019s preg in the comments:\n\nNovember 17, 2020\n\n\n\nAfter Khlo\u00e9 wins a People\u2019s Choice Award, Tristan sends her a huge bouquet of pink flowers.\n\nFebruary 4, 2021\n\nIn a KUWTK ep, Khlo\u00e9 said she was \u201cready\u201d to conceive a second baby with her frozen embryos and Tristan said he was \u201call for it.\u201d \u201cIn my head, when I was gonna have kids, I never ever imagined having an only child,\u201d she explained.\n\nJune 17, 2021\n\nUgh: The Daily Mail reports that Tristan was at Nessel \u201cChubbs\u201d Beezer\u2019s L.A. party and entered into a bedroom with three women.\n\nJune 21, 2021\n\nA bunch of outlets confirm it: The duo have broken up again.\n\nOctober 2021\n\nAccording to a May 2022 episode of Hulu\u2019s The Kardashians, Khlo\u00e9 got back together with Tristan just before Travis Barker proposed to her sister Kourtney. \u201cTristan flew in for the proposal. This was something he was not going to miss.\u2026We\u2019re good. We\u2019re actually in a really good place. We just got back together. He\u2019s been going to therapy a lot. There\u2019s just been a lot of effort on his part.\u201d She added, \u201cI have a lot of hope and faith and optimism for our future together.\u201d\n\nDecember 3, 2021\n\nThe drama just continues: Personal trainer Maralee Nichols gives birth to a baby boy and says Tristan is the father. And if your math skills are good, that means you know they conceived in March 2021, when Tristan was still with Khlo\u00e9 (along with speculation that Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan are together, again, in December 2021, when the news breaks). Maralee sues for child support.\n\nDecember 6, 2021\n\nA source tells Us Weekly, \u201cThis is a very sad time for Khlo\u00e9. She really loves Tristan and still held a candle for him. She thought he might have changed his ways.\u2026Khlo\u00e9 now knows that Tristan was unfaithful to her when they were back together.\u201d\n\nJanuary 3, 2022\n\nTristan confirms paternity of Maralee\u2019s child and writes on his Instagram Stories, \u201cKhlo\u00e9, you don\u2019t deserve this. You don\u2019t deserve the heartache and humiliation I have caused you. You don\u2019t deserve the way I have treated you over the years. My actions certainly have not lined up with the way I view you. I have the utmost respect and love for you. Regardless of what you may think. Again, I am so incredibly sorry.\u201d\n\nMarch 9, 2022\n\nKhlo\u00e9 admits the paternity drama will play out on the new show. \u201cI wish I never had to talk about that because it\u2019s not a fun thing to talk about\u2026but it is part of my journey in life, so we will see it on the show.\u201d\n\nMarch 11, 2022\n\nIn court docs obtained by Us Weekly, Tristan told Maralee over Snapchat in October 2021 (after she told him she was pregnant), \u201cI\u2019m engaged but I will be married soon. I told you I won\u2019t and can\u2019t be in the child life at all by no means.\u2026Why not wait till yoj [sic] find the right person to have a family with. Why would you want a baby with a man that\u2019s engaged. You wanna keep a mistake.\u201d Apparently, he also spent $2 million on a ring\u2014so even though it wasn\u2019t ever announced, the two were allegedly planning on getting married. Tristan says that the texts are fake, FYI.\n\nApril 6, 2022\n\nIn a tell-all with Robin Roberts, Khlo\u00e9 kinda addresses the situation: \u201cI still think [Tristan\u2019s] a great guy, and he\u2019s a great dad. He\u2019s just not the guy for me.\u201d There you have it.\n\nMay 9, 2022\n\nThe Kardashians executive producer Danielle King confirms that the literal moment Khlo\u00e9 found out about the paternity scandal is *on camera*. \u201cWe were there to film something else early in the morning, and the morning that news broke, we legitimately just happened to be there.\u201d\n\nMay 19, 2022\n\nIn an episode filmed in 2021 before the paternity scandal, Khlo\u00e9 says Tristan is \u201cnever leaving\u201d the family. \u201cMom and Dad were best friends, Dad and Stepdad played golf together once a week, Scott [Disick] is never leaving, Kanye is never leaving, looks like you\u2019re never leaving,\u201d she told Tristan. He replied, \u201cMore like you\u2019re never leaving me.\u201d Ugh.\n\nMay 21, 2022\n\nTristan is (no surprise) not at Kourtney and Travis\u2019s wedding in Italy (attended by Khlo\u00e9, naturally) but has some father-daughter time with True.\n\nJune 9, 2022\n\nA new episode of The Kardashians debuts and fans get to relive the drama that was Tristan\u2019s third (!!) cheating scandal. Not only do we find out the fact that Kim Kardashian found out about it before Khlo\u00e9 did, but we also get to hear the sisters\u2019 phone calls IRL as they\u2019re all made aware of the news. *le sigh*\n\n\u201cI\u2019m, like, shaking for [Khlo\u00e9], my soul dies for her,\u201d Kim told Kylie on the phone just after the exact moment she found out Tristan was being sued for child support. \u201cNo, she\u2019s not awake, and what\u2019s so fucking crazy is he wrote a whole declaration, let me read this to you. This is Tristan talking, these are his words,\u201d she continued. \u201cThis is his whole declaration. He\u2019s asking for a paternity test and admitting that he had sex with her. Khlo\u00e9 threw him his 30th birthday. So he went home from the 30th birthday party, went to Houston to play on the road, we can check his schedule, and then slept with this girl.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs always, hindsight is twenty-twenty, and we now know that despite Tristan initially denying that he fathered a third child with Maralee Nichols, he actually\u2026totally did. Luckily, Khlo\u00e9 seems to be in a better place (plus, she did get to go to the Met Gala this year), and TBH, that\u2019s all we can ask. She has truly gone through it!\n\nAugust 5, 2022\n\nKhlo\u00e9 and Tristan welcome baby number two via surrogate! A source at the time tells Entertainment Tonight at the time that it\u2019s a baby boy. The news was initially announced in mid-July, during which an insider dished to Us Weekly that Tristan has \u201ctried countless times to win back\u201d Khlo\u00e9, but \u201cshe\u2019s done with him for good romantically\u201d and now they\u2019re \u201cstrictly co-parenting,\u201d which, fair!\n\nMarch 8, 2023\n\nAbout two months after Tristan\u2019s mom sadly passed away, it\u2019s reported that the reality TV star has been spending time with him. A source tells Entertainment Tonight that not only is Khlo\u00e9\u2019s entire family looking after her ex and his brothers since the death but that they have also \u201cbeen sending flowers, keeping them engaged, and making sure they know they are loved and supported.\u201d\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9 has been very cognizant of making sure Tristan and his brothers don\u2019t feel alone, and she has been doing her best to help them as they deal with this tragic loss. She has acted as an amazing support system.\u2026Tristan wants to show the world, Khlo\u00e9, and his mom\u2014his guardian angel\u2014the man and father that he can be, even more so now,\u201d the insider adds. Unclear what might be in the cards for these two, but what we do know for sure is that they remain focused on their children. \u201cBoth Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan are extremely hands-on parents and True is absolutely loving being an older sister to her baby brother.\u201d\n\n\n\nApril 11, 2023\n\nLooks like Tristan is moving back to California! The athlete was recently traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, which means he\u2019ll be moving back to California. Of the career switch, a source tells People, \u201cKhlo\u00e9 is supportive of Tristan joining the L.A. Lakers. She wants him to have a career. Having Tristan on the road again concerns Khlo\u00e9. This is when all the cheating happened in the past.\u201d\n\nThe insider adds that the former couple recently \u201cbecame very close again\u201d after Tristan\u2019s mom died, with a second source adding, \u201cKhlo\u00e9 thinks Tristan is a great dad, which she\u2019s grateful for.\u2026That sometimes makes it harder to completely shut the door on anything romantic.\u201d\n\nIn-ter-est-ing!\n\nJune 8, 2023\n\nDuring an episode of The Kardashians, Khlo\u00e9 opens up about how she and Tristan are handling their co-parenting duties during a convo with her mom Kris Jenner. \u201cTristan and I, we always get along great,\u201d she begins before adding, \u201cHim and I have a great friendship relationship, we get along fine, and for my kids, I will put anything to the side.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat's done is done, so what would I still be holding on to something for? I don't need to \u2018punish\u2019 him because I'm not getting back with him,\u201d she continues.\n\nMarch 13, 2024\n\nKhlo\u00e9 celebrates her ex's 33rd birthday with an Instagram Story that features the basketball star with their two children. \u201cHappy birthday @realtristan13. Your mommy is proud of you,\u201d she captions the snap.\n\nJune 6, 2024\n\nIn a new episode of The Kardashians, the Good American founder details what her dating life looks like nowadays to Scott Disick. The celeb *also* dishes on how she feels about her future with Tristan, saying the \u201cdoor is closed\u201d romantically. Plus, the athlete's return to the Cleveland Cavaliers has been \u201creally, really healthy for us\u201d because of the increased space, she notes.\n\n\u201cWhen Tristan was next door he was always over,\u201d she adds.\n\nJune 27, 2024\n\nTristan dedicates a buncha Instagram Stories to Khlo\u00e9 in honor of her 40th birthday. \u201cHappy birthday Khlo\u00e9,\u201d the pro athlete pens over an image of himself and the reality star with their two children. He also shares another snap of Khlo\u00e9 and their daughter True, writing, \u201cYou are the best mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are my best friend,\u201d he adds in the following slide before posting a photo of Khlo\u00e9 with his youngest brother Amari alongside the caption, \u201cAnd the most incredible person I\u2019ve ever met.\u201d\n\nTristan Thompson // Instagram\n\nTristan Thompson // Instagram\n\nTristan Thompson // Instagram\n\nTristan Thompson // Instagram\n\nThis post was originally published in September 2017.
