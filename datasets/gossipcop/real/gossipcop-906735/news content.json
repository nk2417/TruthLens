I had a long talk with her about not working with him and it didn\u2019t click,\u201d Teefey commented below an Instagram post on her account. \u201cHer team are amazing people. There is no fall person here. No one controls her. She makes all her own decisions. No matter how hard you try to advise. It falls on deaf ears.\u201d\n\nAllen is accused by his daughter, Dylan Farrow, of molesting her when she was 7 years old. Those allegations were investigated by Connecticut police as well as the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of the Yale-New Haven Hospital, though charges were never filed despite a state attorney determining there was \u201cprobable cause\u201d to prosecute, according to The New York Times.\n\nFarrow brought renewed attention to the allegations when she reiterated those claims against Allen in a 2014 open letter.\n\nGomez has not expounded on her decision to join the movie directed by Allen, which does not have a premiere date. She told Billboard last year that she didn\u2019t know how to reply when asked if she considered the accusations against Allen before signing on for the film.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not sure how to answer \u2014 not because I\u2019m trying to back away from it,\u201d Gomez told the music outlet. \u201c(The Harvey Weinstein scandal) actually happened right after I had started (the Allen film). They popped up in the midst of it. And that\u2019s something, yes, I had to face and discuss. I stepped back and thought, \u2018Wow, the universe works in interesting ways.'\u201d\n\nAt least three stars of the movie \u2014 Timothee Chalamet, Rebecca Hall and Griffin Newman \u2014 have vowed to donate their income from the movie to different charities supporting women and the Time\u2019s Up movement.\n\nGomez stars in Woody Allen\u2019s new film \u201cA Rainy Day in New York.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Tuesday, actor Alec Baldwin tweeted his support for Allen.\n\n\u201cWoody Allen was investigated forensically by two states (NY and CT) and no charges were filed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe renunciation of him and his work, no doubt, has some purpose. But it\u2019s unfair and sad to me. I worked w WA 3 times and it was one of the privileges of my career.\u201d\n\nTeefey\u2019s comment about her daughter working with Allen comes during the same week where she told Gossip Cop she\u2019s \u201cnot happy\u201d about Gomez rekindling her relationship with on-and-off boyfriend Justin Bieber.", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/01/16/2RTSAQF22JPHOR4BI7ECP72DZU.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/01/16/2RTSAQF22JPHOR4BI7ECP72DZU.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Sblendorio"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/01/16/selena-gomezs-mom-told-her-not-to-work-with-woody-allen/", "title": "Selena Gomez\u2019s mom told her not to work with Woody Allen", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Peter Sblendorio", "canonical": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/01/16/selena-gomezs-mom-told-her-not-to-work-with-woody-allen/"}, "description": "Gomez has drawn backlash for starring in the scandal-scarred  Allen's new film, \"A Rainy Day in New York.\"", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Selena Gomez\u2019s mom told her not to work with Woody Allen", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/01/16/selena-gomezs-mom-told-her-not-to-work-with-woody-allen/", "description": "Selena Gomez\u2019s mother says she urged her daughter not to work with accused child abuser Woody Allen on his latest film \u2014 to no avail.
