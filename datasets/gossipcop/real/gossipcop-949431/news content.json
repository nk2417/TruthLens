Speculation surrounding their rumored romance began in May 2017 after the two were spotted kissing while filming a scene for the action movie.\n\n\"Even though the crew were there, it was all [in the tabloids] like, 'The next wife falls at his feet,'\" Kirby began during an interview with the August 2018 issue of Marie Claire UK. At the time, she had already been in her current relationship with actor Callum Turner for nearly two years.\n\nThe Netflix star added, \"The most disconcerting thing was the people I didn't think would believe it, did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, 'Are you OK?' I don't think they believe anything they read now because you just can't. None of it is real. To be getting married to him? Not even a snog, it was marriage.\"\n\nWhile there are a number of real-life couples who did actually meet on set, Kirby, 30, and Cruise, 56, clearly are not one of them. However, the tabloid fodder gave the actress a crash course in how to balance her newfound fame with keeping her personal life private.\n\n\"It's a weird feeling. I definitely don't feel it yet. I've been lucky because I barely get recognized, and I keep my relationship super private,\" Kirby continued. \"[Turner's] just completely wonderful and he's my best friend, so that's ... I guess you can either choose to talk about it or not. If you talk about it, it becomes interesting to people, but if you don't, then it's not.\"\n\nKirby isn't the only celeb to recently dismiss relationship rumors. As Nicki Swift previously reported, Nikki Bella posted a video on YouTube over the weekend to reveal that she and former fianc\u00e9 John Cena are not actually back together after announcing their split in mid-April. \"Right now, we're just friends,\" the WWE star told her fans amid rumors of the former couple's rekindled romance. \"We're working on each other and trying to work on us, and we talk every day.\"", "images": ["https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nicki-swift-icon-white.svg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/vanessa-kirby-addresses-tom-cruise-romance-rumors/intro-1530801411.jpg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_white_2.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/vanessa-kirby-addresses-tom-cruise-romance-rumors/intro-1530801411.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dianne Gebauer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nickiswift.com/127900/vanessa-kirby-addresses-tom-cruise-romance-rumors/", "title": "Vanessa Kirby Addresses Tom Cruise Romance Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "thumbnail": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/vanessa-kirby-addresses-tom-cruise-romance-rumors/intro-1530801411.jpg", "description": "Vanessa Kirby is setting the record straight on her love life.
