As Gabriel Lorca, Jason Isaacs plays a Star Fleet captain unlike any in \u201cStar Trek\u201d history. An officer on a wartime mission, Lorca is calculating, secretive, and more than willing to break whatever rules he needs to to help the Federation win its war against the Klingon Empire.\n\nIsaacs spoke with Variety about the character\u2019s history, his plans for Sonequa Martin-Green\u2019s court-martialed Michael Burnham, and how his work more than a decade and a half ago on the military drama \u201cBlack Hawk Down\u201d helped him prepare for \u201cDiscovery.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s Lorca\u2019s worldview?\n\nHe\u2019s focused on the thing right in front of him, and it\u2019s for other people to analyze what\u2019s going on in the bigger picture. He\u2019s got a war to win. He\u2019s been given a science ship. He\u2019s been given people who are explorers, not warriors. And he needs the staff and crew around him to be people who are going to do what needs to be done, because he thinks, slightly arrogantly or possibly correctly, that the Federation has the wrong mindset, that they\u2019re up against enemies who are way more capable than they are, and that he is going to have to somehow make a breakthrough in technology and suspend the normal rules of engagement and Federation directives, if he\u2019s going to save not just the people who are on the ship, but an infinite number of planets from slaughter and invasion. He\u2019s got an enormous amount on his mind.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWhat does he see in Burnham that looks useful?\n\nShe\u2019s someone that has already made a decision to do what needs to be done practically and smartly in a crisis situation, and she gets who the enemy are and how you need to treat them. That\u2019s pretty rare. She\u2019s also very capable. She has a computer brain \u2014 she was raised on Vulcan and did particularly well at the academy. And she will be invested in him, because he\u2019s saving her \u2014 and that\u2019s not nothing, either, when you\u2019re trying to build a chain of command. She\u2019s capable and she\u2019s willing, and to an extent, her loyalty is up for grabs.\n\nStamets calls Lorca a warmonger. Is he right?\n\nStamets is a f\u2014ing idiot. [Laughs] They can all say what they want, and in peace time they can sit around and examine their nasal hairs. But right now, there\u2019s people firing on us and trying to kill us, and Stamets would like to run double-blind tests on everything for a couple years and do control groups, and I need technology that will give us an edge in a war that we\u2019re probably going to lose otherwise. So there\u2019s a necessary, hopefully dramatic, and enjoyable tension between them.\n\nWhen we see the Shenzhou in the pilot, it is presented as this sort of quaint relic. What is the Discovery in comparison?\n\nThe Discovery is ostensibly a science vessel, but a long way away from everybody\u2019s attention, we are trying to perfect a technology that will allow us to gain the upper hand. And I\u2019ve also been given license by the Federation, who are at a loss for what to do, to do whatever is necessary. So I can hire anyone I want, I can conduct myself in ways that break the rule book, and no one can really call me on it.\n\nWhat is Lorca\u2019s background and what makes him so different from what we typically think of a Star Fleet officer being?\n\nYou don\u2019t want to be asking about things that get revealed during the show. But he\u2019s a guy who\u2019s seen a lot of action. He\u2019s seen a lot of war. He\u2019s been affected by it. Does it make him cold or does it make him efficient? Does it make him unsentimentally brilliant at strategy or does it make him inhuman? He\u2019s seen what death can do, and he\u2019s seen what happens when the enemy wins, and that has affected all of his decisions.\n\nWas his Southern accent something you brought to him?\n\nYes. I had no interest in being English and being a very pale shadow of the brilliant Patrick Stewart [Capt. Jean-Luc Picard on \u201cStar Trek: The Next Generation\u201d]. I just wanted to do something that would make it interesting for the audience, and new and fresh. I hadn\u2019t heard a captain who sounded like this. And he\u2019s a military man, but he can be immensely charming. I\u2019ve been privileged enough to work with the [U.S. Army] Rangers at Fort Benning, and no matter where you come from in America, if you train down South where most of the bases are, you pick up some form of a Southern accent. And I wanted something that had subliminal hints at the military.\n\nHe is obviously very different than the character who we believe at the outset of the show will be Burnham\u2019s captain. How would you contrast Lorca and Georgiou?\n\nGeorgiou is a mother figure, and I am unsentimental and don\u2019t see my job as protecting [Burnham] emotionally or any other way. I see her as a very, very useful asset in this war.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/star-trek-discovery-3.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/star-trek-discovery-3.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Holloway", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/star-trek-discovery-jason-isaacs-lorca-burnham-1202577523/", "title": "\u2018Star Trek: Discovery\u2019: Jason Isaacs on His Character\u2019s Origins and What He Wants From Burnham", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"Star Trek: Discovery's\" Jason Isaacs discusses his character's history and his plans for Sonequa Martin-Green's Michael Burnham.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Daniel Holloway", "tags": "Fall Tv, Jason Isaacs, Star Trek: Discovery", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Star Trek: Discovery\u2019: Jason Isaacs on His Character\u2019s Origins and What He Wants From Burnham", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/star-trek-discovery-jason-isaacs-lorca-burnham-1202577523/", "description": "\"Star Trek: Discovery's\" Jason Isaacs discusses his character's history and his plans for Sonequa Martin-Green's Michael Burnham.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/star-trek-discovery-3.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "\"Context Is for Kings\" -- Episode #103 -- Episodic coverage the CBS All Access series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.
