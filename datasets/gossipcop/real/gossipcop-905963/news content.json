So it seems like the only natural way to honor their time together is with a look back at the songs their love inspired, ranging from tracks that are Fully and Publicly Confirmed to Be About Joe to many that are Not Confirmed but Almost Universally Assumed to Be Fully About Joe to a few best described as Not *About* Joe but Not Totally *Not* About Joe.\n\nReputation\n\n\u201c\u2026Ready for It?\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Completely. This song is literally Taylor being like, \u201cHey, Joe, ready for this epic and sexy romance that\u2019s about to happen? Because it\u2019s definitely about to happen.\u201d\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cSome, some boys are tryin\u2019 too hard / He don\u2019t try at all though / Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so / I see nothing better, I keep him forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cEnd Game\u201d feat. Ed Sheeran and Future\n\nHow about Joe it is: At least one-third. The song also features verses from Ed Sheeran and Future, neither of whom seem to be referring to Joe at all. Taylor\u2019s verse, however\u2014pure Joe.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cAnd I can\u2019t let you go, your handprint\u2019s on my soul / It\u2019s like your eyes are liquor, it\u2019s like your body is gold / You\u2019ve been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks / So here\u2019s the truth from my red lips.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Practically biblically, considering some of the imagery in the song (or unhealthily, if you gravitate more toward the addiction metaphor). Either way, it\u2019s about the intensity of falling for someone and it\u2019s on Reputation, which means it\u2019s about Joe.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cI\u2019ve been breakin\u2019 hearts a long time and / Toyin\u2019 with them older guys / Just playthings for me to use / Something happened for the first time, in / The darkest little paradise / Shakin\u2019, pacin\u2019, I just need you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDelicate\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHow about Joe it is: Iconically. Hard stop. Their dive bar origin story has become mythic among Swifties.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cDark jeans and your Nikes, look at you / Oh, damn, never seen that color blue / Just think of the fun things we could do.\u201d\n\n\u201cGorgeous\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: 100 percent. \u201cGorgeous\u201d is the story of Joe and Taylor\u2019s electric, tipsy, dancing-on-the-edge-of-infidelity meet-cute.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cOcean blue eyes looking in mine / I feel like I might sink and drown and die.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo It Goes\u2026\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Again, totally about Joe. There\u2019s a reference to the bar meet-cute. Allusions to the struggles of dating while famous. A promise from Taylor to be there for Joe on his worst days. Even a nod to the \u201cJ\u201d necklace Joe gifted Taylor early in their \u2019ship. So many bases covered.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cMet you in a bar / All eyes on me, your illusionist / All eyes on us / I make all your gray days clear and / Wear you like a necklace.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cKing of My Heart\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Hint: *He\u2019s* the king from the title.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cYour love is a secret I\u2019m hoping, dreaming, dying to keep / Change my priorities / The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury.\u201d\n\n\u201cDancing With Our Hands Tied\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: It\u2019s mostly about Joe, but it\u2019s also about the intersection of loving Joe and dealing with the reality of being Taylor Swift levels of famous and all things that prompted her pre-Reputation withdrawal from public view.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cI loved you in secret / First sight, yeah, we love without reason / Oh, 25 years old / Oh, how were you to know, and / My, my love had been frozen / Deep blue, but you painted me golden.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cDress\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: The only thing \u201cDress\u201d might be about more than Joe Alwyn is Taylor Swift\u2019s unabashed horniness for Joe Alwyn.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cFlashback when you met me / Your buzz cut and my hair bleached / Even in my worst times / You could see the best of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall It What You Want\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: It\u2019s about both Joe and the downfall of Taylor\u2019s reputation before she met Joe\u2014truly hitting all the album\u2019s biggest themes.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201c\u2019Cause my baby\u2019s fit like a daydream / Walkin\u2019 with his head down, I\u2019m the one he\u2019s walkin\u2019 to / So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew Year\u2019s Day\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Completely Joe-focused, specifically on Taylor\u2019s vision for a very Real Couple future with him (and several reminders of her early insecurity about losing him).\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cYou squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi / I can tell that it\u2019s gonna be a long road / I\u2019ll be there if you\u2019re the toast of the town, babe / Or if you strike out and you\u2019re crawling home.\u201d\n\nLover\n\n\u201cCruel Summer\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: It\u2019s probably honestly more about Taylor\u2019s inner life and headspace during the beginnings of their romance in summer of 2016 (which was just a terrible time for her in many ways), but Joe was there, being the person she was falling for/feeling deeply insecure about falling for/alllllmost breaking her soul until he saved it by looking up grinning like a devil (you\u2019re picturing the exact face right now, right?).\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cAnd I screamed for whatever it\u2019s worth / \u2018I love you,\u2019 ain\u2019t that the worst thing you ever heard? / He looks up grinning like a devil.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLover\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: He\u2019s her lover. It\u2019s all him (except the house, which is all about flexing her ability to plant Easter eggs multiple albums out).\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cI\u2019m highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you / I\u2019ve loved you three summers now, honey, but I want \u2019em all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Archer\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Not a ton, honestly. \u201cThe Archer\u201d is really more about Taylor reckoning with the roles she\u2019s played in other relationships/situations in life and reflecting on her flaws/past mistakes (and then hoping her hardest that she won\u2019t repeat them with Joe).\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cAll the king\u2019s horses, all the king\u2019s men / Couldn\u2019t put me together again / \u2019Cause all of my enemies started out friends / Help me hold on to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI Think He Knows\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Mostly Joe. A little \u201cMastermind\u201d foreshadowing.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cHe got that boyish look that I like in a man / I am an architect, I\u2019m drawing up the plans / It\u2019s like I\u2019m 17, nobody understands.\u201d\n\n\u201cPaper Rings\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: 95 percent Joe, 4 percent Joe\u2019s friends and family, 1 percent Taylor confessing to stalking.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cI\u2019m with you even if it makes me blue / Which takes me back / To the color that we painted your brother\u2019s wall / Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws / We wouldn\u2019t be standing here so tall.\u201d\n\n\u201cCornelia Street\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: In addition to being about Joe, \u201cCornelia Street\u201d highlights a low moment in the \u2019ship early on that\u2019s become as important to their musical mythology as the dive bar.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cBack when we were card sharks, playing games / I thought you were leading me on / I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street / Before you even knew I was gone.\u201d\n\n\u201cLondon Boy\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nHow about Joe it is: Despite the title that seems totally Joe-focused, there\u2019s also a fair amount of Taylor just gushing about British things she likes in addition to the titular boy.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cBut something happened, I heard him laughing / I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent / They say home is where the heart is / But that\u2019s not where mine lives / You know I love a London boy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfterglow\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Joe might be (and we assume is\u2014especially considering the reference to the color blue, which Taylor frequently associates with Joe in songs) the other party in the fight that inspired this song, but it\u2019s much more about Taylor self-reflecting, owning her bad behavior, and apologizing after a blowup.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cI blew things out of proportion, now you\u2019re blue / Put you in jail for something you didn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\n\u201cDaylight\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Again, Joe is a factor in the song, but it\u2019s much more about Taylor\u2019s inner journey to learning what real love and a healthy relationship meant for her (while Joe as an individual is associated with blue in her songs, their relationship/real love is associated with gold).\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cI once believed love would be (burning red) / But it\u2019s golden / Like daylight, like daylight / Like daylight, daylight.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of the Girls You Loved Before\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: It\u2019s actually, like, 50 percent about Joe and 50 percent an anthem to his exes (and not even in a salty way).\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cYour past and mine are parallel lines / Stars all aligned and they intertwined / And taught you / The way you call me \u2018baby\u2019 / Treat me like a lady / All that I can say is / All of the girls you loved before (ooh) / Made you the one I\u2019ve fallen for.\u201d\n\nFolklore\n\n\u201cInvisible String\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: If anything, the song is even more about fate and the universe leading you to your Right Person than about Joe and Taylor specifically. But it *does* also include several specifics about their lives (and a dive bar callback).\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cA string that pulled me / Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar / Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire / Chains around my demons, wool to brave the seasons / One single thread of gold tied me to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeace\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: \u201cPeace\u201d is more about Taylor grappling with her inability to ever give Joe (or any other partner) true peace and normalcy, no matter how hard she tries\u2014and wondering if anything else she does in a relationship (but specifically in her relationship with Joe) can ever fully make up for that fact.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cBut I\u2019m a fire, and I\u2019ll keep your brittle heart warm / If your cascade ocean wave blues come.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lakes\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: \u201cThe Lakes\u201d is mostly art, creating art, and wishing you could do that without the hum of social media and other modern distractions in the background. But the lakes in question are a special place for Taylor and Joe (they spent their three-year anniversary there) and she explicitly dubs him her muse in the song.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cTake me to the lakes where all the poets went to die / I don\u2019t belong, and my beloved, neither do you / Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry / I\u2019m setting off but not without my muse.\u201d\n\nEvermore\n\n\u201cWillow\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Unclear. A lot of the songs on Folklore and Evermore were not autobiographical at all, but there are enough references in \u201cWillow\u201d to make an argument for some Joe inspiration in the track.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cWherever you stray / I follow / I\u2019m begging for you to take my hand / Wreck my plans / That\u2019s my man.\u201d\n\n\u201cLong Story Short\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: This song covers a lot of the bleh things Taylor went through during the lows of her pre-Reputation and pre-meeting-Joe-Alwyn era. While the focus isn\u2019t fully on Joe, he gets credit for being the right decision after all the wrong ones.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cPushed from the precipice / Clung to the nearest lips / Long story short, it was the wrong guy / Now I\u2019m all about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvermore\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: This song is also more about going through a rough patch that just doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to ever end/get better, but once again, Joe makes an appearance as the personified silver lining he\u2019s clearly been for Taylor when she needs it most.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cAnd when I was shipwrecked (can\u2019t think of all the cost) / I thought of you (all the things that will be lost now) / In the cracks of light (can we just get a pause?) / I dreamed of you (to be certain we\u2019ll be tall again).\u201d\n\nMidnights\n\n\u201cLavender Haze\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: This is Taylor\u2019s confirmed ode to her and Joe\u2019s love bubble and the value of keeping their love private and not letting outside forces affect it.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cAll they keep askin\u2019 me (all they keep askin\u2019 me) / Is if I\u2019m gonna be your bride / The only kind of girl they see (only kind of girl they see) / Is a one-night or a wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cKarma\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Barely at all, tbh. But Taylor includes Joe in her list of great things in her life that prove she has good karma, so\u2026.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cKarma is the guy on the screen / Coming straight home to me\u201d AND \u201c\u2019Cause karma is my boyfriend (karma is my boyfriend) / Karma is a god.\u201d\n\nNow, Karma is the guy on the Chiefs... Taylor Swift Kisses Travis Kelce After Sydney Show\n\n\u201cSweet Nothing\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: The song is about how amazing it is that Joe is the calm, steady presence in her life and the person she can count on not to have ulterior motives with her. Oh, and he also co-wrote it, so he must agree that he\u2019s those things.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cEveryone\u2019s up to something / I find myself running home to your sweet nothings / Outside, they\u2019re push and shoving / You\u2019re in the kitchen humming / All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cMastermind\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Remember how Taylor implied fate brought her and Joe together in \u201cInvisible String\u201d? Well, in \u201cMastermind,\u201d she clarifies that fate might have gotten them to the same room, but then she took over from there (from the touch of a hand referenced in \u201cGorgeous,\u201d it seems). The song also makes it clear that Joe was aware of and on board with her scheming.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cAnd the touch of a hand lit the fuse / Of a chain reaction of countermoves / To assess the equation of you / Checkmate, I couldn\u2019t lose.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Great War\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Not every moment of Joe and Taylor\u2019s relationship was perfect, and Taylor wrote candidly about one of their worst fights in \u201cThe Great War,\u201d which is about the relationship and Taylor\u2019s conflict resolution skills more than Joe specifically, but he\u2019s definitely in there.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cSoldier down on that icy ground / Looked up at me with honor and truth / Broken and blue, so I called off the troops / That was the night I nearly lost you / I really thought I lost you.\u201d\n\n\u201cGlitch\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Very. In addition to having a very accurate, to-the-day reference to how long they\u2019d been together at the time the song was written, \u201cGlitch\u201d reiterates the idea that Taylor thought she and Joe were meant to be friends before the feelings started flying and her plans/preconceived notions went right in the trash.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cI was supposed to sweat you out / In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else\u2019s playground / But it\u2019s been 2,190 days of our love blackout.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re Losing Me\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Seemingly very, considering the timing of the post-breakup release and references to a relationship that died a slow, painful death.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cHow long could we be a sad song / Till we were too far gone to bring back to life? / I gave you all my best me\u2019s, my endless empathy.\u201d\n\nThe Tortured Poets Department\n\n\u201cSo Long, London\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Incredibly. Fans have dubbed \"So Long, London\" the antithesis of Lover's \"London Boy,\" both lyrically and sonically. The track details the pain that comes from the city and the relationship that started (and ended) in it.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \"You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues? / I died on the altar waitin' for the proof / You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days / And I'm just getting color back into my face / I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for / So long, London.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cFresh Out the Slammer\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: I'd say it's 50/50\u2014the song details how Taylor called up a specific person after a breakup, and Swifties speculate that it could be about her 'ship with Matty Healy after she ended things with Joe.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \"All those nights, he kept me goin' / Swirled you into all of my poems / Now we're at the starting line, I did my time.\"\n\n\u201cloml\u201d\n\nMore on that here \ud83d\udc47 Taylor\u2019s \u2018LOML\u2019 Lyrics are Devastating\n\nHow about Joe it is: This somber piano-driven ballad is a devastating account of the end of a relationship. Taylor never actually refers to its subject as the \"love of my life,\" but the \"loss of my life\" as she recalls talks of getting married and having children with said person.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \"You shit-talked me under the table / Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles / I wish I could un-recall / How we almost had it all.\"\n\n\n\n\u201cI Can Do It With a Broken Heart\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: A little bit. This uptempo track seemingly samples the sound of Taylor's in-ear monitors during live performances, and its lyrics call back to putting on a show despite being heartbroken. I.e. Taylor embarking on her incredibly successful Eras Tour after her breakup with Joe.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \"He said he'd love me all his life / But that life was too short / Breaking down, I hit the floor / All the pi\u0435ces of me shatter\u0435d as the crowd was chanting, 'More.'\"\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Albatross\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Partly\u2014it seems like it could be about multiple lovers or an ambiguous subject as she muses, \"They tried to warn you about me.\"\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \"You couldn't conceive it / You were sleeping soundly / When they dragged you from your bed / And I tried to warn you about them.\"\n\n\u201cHow Did It End?\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: The entire song details how outsiders asked how a certain relationship ended, as well as the people who made up the partnership. There wasn't much public info on Taylor's split from Joe, aside from multiple reports citing anonymous sources.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \"We were blind to unforeseen circumstances / We learned th\u0435 right steps to different danc\u0435s / And fell victim to interlopers' glances / Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?\"\n\nThe Life of a Showgirl\n\n\u201cThe Fate of Ophelia\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Ever-so-slightly. Despite the song being an allusion to Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet and Joe starring in not one, but two Hamlet movies coming up (he\u2019s playing Laertes in the Aneil Karia-directed movie Hamlet...as well as Shakespeare\u2019s wife\u2019s brother, Bartholomew, in the Chlo\u00e9 Zhao\u2013directed movie Hamnet), Tay (seemingly) only makes a passing reference to prior heartbreak in this one, which is mostly an ode to Travis.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \u201cAnd if you'd never come for me / I might've drowned in the melancholy.\u201d\n\n\u201cElizabeth Taylor\u201d\n\nHow about Joe it is: Just a pinch. Again, just a passing reference here, but still\u2014sources have indicated that Taylor and Joe\u2019s breakup had a lot to do with his disinterest in the spotlight.\n\nJoe-est lyric/reference: \"All the right guys promised they'd stay / Under bright lights, they withered away.\"", "images":
