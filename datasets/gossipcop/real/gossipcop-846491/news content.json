Kylie arrived to the Schiaparelli show looking chic in a curve-hugging pink gown, which she paired with a piece of netting that covered her entire head.\n\nNeil Mockford // Getty Images\n\nNeil Mockford // Getty Images\n\nThe last time Kylie was in Paris was for Fashion Week was back in January, when people had a lot to say about her appearance at the Jean Paul Gaultier Haute Couture show\u2014where she was photographed in minimal makeup.\n\nQuick Update on These Two An Investigative Timeline of Timmy and Kylie\n\nThe reality star opened up about the criticism/bullying on The Kardashians, telling her sister Kendall Jenner that \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle that I still have confidence and I can still look in the mirror and think that I am pretty. Because I just feel like after Paris there was this picture, which, for the first time I was like, 'We are not going to wear a lot of makeup.' And it's like I wear too much makeup and it's like 'you're wearing too much makeup.' Then I go and don't wear a lot of makeup and someone catches me in a weird light. You can look at pictures since I'm 13, I just have these lines, but I have had them since I was a child.\u201d\n\n\n\nAn emotional Kylie then added, \u201cI went on a journey last year dissolving like half of my lip filler. I hate even having this conversation over and over and over again, because it feels like it\u2019s a waste of my breath. Because I think with me it is never going to change.\u201d\n\nShe went on to say, \u201cI have never cried about this before but I guess it does affect me. And then I'll see some comments and someone will be like, 'This is really mean' and defend me, like 'Why are we talking about her looks? It\u2019s 2024\u2019 And I'll see other comments that are like, \u2018Because she did it to herself. She fucked up her face and had so much surgery.' Even if I did get so much surgery, and I got all these things, I still don\u2019t think it is okay to talk about someone\u2019s looks. People have been talking about my looks since I was 12, 13. Before I even got lip filler, people would talk about my looks.\u201d\n\nWatch their emotional chat here:", "images":
