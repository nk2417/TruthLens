However, that excitement \u201cquickly evaporated\u201d after he saw the \u201cdisturbing image.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether an oblivious oversight or not, it\u2019s truly sad and disturbing that in 2018, something so racially and culturally insensitive could pass by the eyes of so many (stylist, photographer, creative and marketing teams) and be deemed acceptable,\u201d he added. \u201cI can\u2019t allow for my name and brand to be associated with a company that could let this happen. I hope that this situation will serve as the wake up call that H&M and other companies need to get on track and become racially and culturally aware, as well as more diverse at every level.\u201d\n\nThe Weeknd tweeted on Monday: \u201cWoke up this morning shocked and embarrassed by this photo. I\u2019m deeply offended and will not be working with H&M anymore.\u201d Backlash over the photo spread this week on social media, with various celebrities \u2013 including Questlove \u2013 blasting the U.K. ad. H&M quickly responded by apologizing, pulling the photo and removing the product from sale.\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nThe company issued another apology on Tuesday, admitting they \u201cgot this wrong and are deeply sorry.\u201d\n\nTrending Stories Kevin Spacey Says He Has 'No Home' After Sexual Misconduct Allegations 2025 CMA Awards: The Complete Winners List Neighbor Indicted in Murder of \u2018King of the Hill\u2019 Star Jonathan Joss \u2018Faith Is Under Attack': Nicki Minaj Spreads Misleading Information at the United Nations\n\n\u201cOur standards are high and we feel that we have made real progress over the years in playing our part in promoting diversity and inclusion,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBut we clearly haven\u2019t come far enough \u2026 We agree with all the criticism that this has generated \u2013 we have got this wrong and we agree that, even if unintentional, passive or casual racism needs to be eradicated wherever it exists. We appreciate the support of those who have seen that our product and promotion were not intended to cause offense but, as a global brand, we have a responsibility to be aware of and attuned to all racial and cultural sensitivities \u2013 and we have not lived up to this responsibility this time.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/g-eazy-hm-partnership-d87a915e-bad8-4981-bc04-cb13a22fc6aa.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/g-eazy-hm-partnership-d87a915e-bad8-4981-bc04-cb13a22fc6aa.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Reed", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/g-eazy-ends-hm-partnership-over-disturbing-racially-insensitive-ad-123625/", "title": "G-Eazy Ends H&M Partnership Over \u2018Disturbing,\u2019 \u2018Racially Insensitive\u2019 Ad", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "G-Eazy ended his partnership with H&M over a \"racially insensitive\" photo of a black child modeling a \"Coolest Monkey in the Jungle\" hoodie.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Ryan Reed", "tags": "G-eazy, The Weeknd", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "G-Eazy Ends H&M Partnership Over 'Disturbing,' 'Racially Insensitive' Ad", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/g-eazy-ends-hm-partnership-over-disturbing-racially-insensitive-ad-123625/", "description": "G-Eazy ended his partnership with H&M over a \"racially insensitive\" photo of a black child modeling a \"Coolest Monkey in the Jungle\" hoodie.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/g-eazy-hm-partnership-d87a915e-bad8-4981-bc04-cb13a22fc6aa.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "width": 1401, "height": 788, "alt": "G-Eazy"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-10T15:35:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T16:37:27+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "G-Eazy ended his partnership with H&M over a \"racially insensitive\" photo of a black child modeling a \"Coolest Monkey in the Jungle\" hoodie.", "site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "G-Eazy Ends H&M Partnership Over \u2018Disturbing,\u2019 \u2018Racially Insensitive\u2019 Ad", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/g-eazy-hm-partnership-d87a915e-bad8-4981-bc04-cb13a22fc6aa.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515598500.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
