You are doing a book called the 'Diary of princess pushy's sister'.'\n\nSamantha replied that a 'book cannot be judged by its cover or by its title'.\n\nPiers Morgan today called Meghan Markle's estranged half-sister Samantha (right) a 'little vulture' and accused her of grabbing money by trashing the Suits star for years\n\nSamantha Markle, pictured with her famous half-sister in 2008, has said it's her fault their father agreed to appear in staged photos on the eve of the royal wedding\n\nShe also confirmed that her father has pulled out of Saturday's wedding but she hopes he will change his mind.\n\nShe said: 'I spoke to him early in the morning and he was quite depressed'.\n\nWhen asked if he might change his mind she said: 'I hope so. I wanted to see him go [to the wedding]. I don't know as of today what his plans are but I want him to go. Clearly the priority is whether it's safe for him to do that.'\n\nYesterday claimed that she was 'the culprit' behind the embarrassing 'faked' photographs of their father taken in the run-up to this week's royal wedding.\n\nSamantha, Thomas Markle's daughter by his first marriage, said she advised him to co-operate with a US-based paparazzo photographer in order to show himself - and, strangely, the royal family - in a 'positive' light and insisted his motive hadn't been money.\n\nBut she could not confirm whether Mr Markle had actually accepted any payment for his collusion for the stunt. Mr Markle later told TMZ he had.\n\nMs Markle told GMB: 'He was unfairly present in the media as shabby, I think photographer looked for the most unflattering photographs.\n\n'My father has really suffered at the hands of the media. I think a person has a right to say 'enough is enough, I wasn't to be shown how I really am'.\n\nBut Piers hit back and said he was a 'grown man who knew what he was doing'.\n\nHe said: 'You say this is all the media's fault, because the media has been treating him in shabby way, viewers will look at the way you've treated you sister Meghan and think that you treated her in a shabby way\n\n'You've spent the last two years criticising her, you called her narcissistic, selfish, that Hollywood has changed her and that Prince Harry shouldn't marry her, yet you have the gall to blame media vultures.\n\n'You've made loads of money off the back of a tenuous link to Meghan Markle, who you've spoken to once in 10 years. You've been trashing her for two years you vulture'.\n\nSamantha said she had not used those words to describe Meghan and Piers said 'we have all the transcripts'.\n\nMeghan Markle's father Thomas has not spoken to his daughter (together in 2000) since pulling out of her wedding and is 'popping Valium' after suffering chest pains in the wake of his paparazzi deal\n\nPiers continued his tirade against Samantha Markle during an appearance on Good Morning America Tuesday saying she was making the situation worse every time she opened her mouth\n\nDuring an appearance on Good Morning America on Tuesday, Piers continued his tirade against Samantha Markle saying she was making the situation worse every time she opened her mouth.\n\n'You can't choose your family, I know that, but Meghan Markle has been particularly unlucky in having endless siblings coming forward being incredibly derogatory about her and just blatantly rude,' he said.\n\n'I think they should all just be quiet. It's now culminated in Meghan's own father taking money from a paparazzo to stage pictures to con the world and put a false impression about him - all a week before his daughter's wedding.\n\n'Why don't you all just be quiet and be dignified and think about the most important person here... which is Meghan.'\n\nWhen speaking about Meghan's father deciding not to attend the upcoming nuptials, Piers said he believed he had let his daughter down.\n\n'I think he's behaved very stupidly, very selfishly, he's let his daughter down. If he really wants to make amends to Meghan then I suggest he stop feeling sorry for himself, get on a plane and walk her down the aisle,' he said.\n\nThomas agreed to pose for a photographer browsing the internet for pictures of his daughter and Harry\n\nThomas was then seen in a series of photos getting fitted for his wedding suit\n\nHarry and Meghan are said to be heartbroken by his decision and will try to change his mind with just four days until their wedding\n\nYesterday she confirmed photographs taken of an apparently unwitting Mr Markle getting fitted up for his wedding suit and browsing pictures of his daughter on the internet had actually been taken in collaboration with a professional photographer, despite Kensington Palace issuing strongly worded requests for the media to protect his privacy.\n\nSpeaking from her home in Florida to ITV's Loose Women programme in London, his eldest daughter, Samantha, said: 'I have to say I am entirely the culprit. As we know the media can take very unflattering photographs of people on their casual days and blow it way out of proportion.\n\n'I said, you know, [to him] the world has no idea you're getting in shape, doing healthy things.\n\n'They don't photograph you buying vegetables and PH water. They photograph you as unflattering ways as they can.\n\n'So I said, really you need to show the world that you're getting in shape and doing great healthy things. So I suggested it.\n\n'There's a lot of scrutiny that it was money motivated, it was not. It was my suggestion that to benefit him and to benefit the royal family that everyone looked good and they depict you as you are - in shape and doing healthy things.'\n\nAsked if she could categorically say he did not receive money for the photographs, Samantha floundered slightly, saying: 'I don't believe so and that was not the motive. I have no idea but if he did I'm going to assume it was a pittance. They don't pay that much. It was really so that the world could see him doing the healthy things he enjoys doing.'\n\nAsked whether she could understand how embarrassing the revelations were for Kensington Palace and her sister, particularly given their stance on protecting his privacy, she conceded that it would be 'awkward' but felt that his treatment by the media had been 'unjust' and 'somehow we could spin it...'\n\nShe also tweeted: 'The bad press over my father doing staged photos is my fault. The media was unfairly making him look bad so I suggested he do positive photos for his benefit and the benefit of the royal family. We had no idea he would be taken advantage of. It was not for money'\n\nDespite posting a string of vitriolic tweets attacking her younger sister, Samantha also insisted that she was not bitter about Meghan's decision not to invite her to Saturday's wedding. The pair haven't actually seen each other for around a decade.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/14/4C25886000000578-5730265-Thomas_gets_suited-a-25_1526389440230.jpg",
