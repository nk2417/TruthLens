The girl auditioned in 2012, when the panel was made up of Louis Walsh, Tulisa Contostavlos, Gary Barlow and Nicole Scherzinger\n\n'It turned out to be the worst thing she could have done,' her mother told The Sun of Simon Cowell's ITV show.\n\n'After it aired she got hate mail and death threats. Her life went downhill and she wasn't the same girl she had been.'\n\nAn X Factor spokesman said he could not comment on the case.\n\nJudge Mr Justice Cobb heard the singer, who is now 20 and auditioned for the show in 2012, felt she had performed badly, prompting her decline into a pattern of 'risky, promiscuous and self-destructive' behaviour.\n\nMr Justice Cobb (pictured) said the girl was plunged into a crisis of confidence by what she believed was her dreadful showing in the audition\n\nHe ruled that she was not so different from any number of other untidy, chaotic young people, and that her ability to make 'relevant decisions' and keep herself safe had developed.\n\nIn his written ruling, Mr Justice Cobb, said the girl was plunged into a crisis of confidence by what she believed was her dreadful showing in the audition. He did not name the show she had auditioned for, but it is understood to have been The X Factor.\n\nAlthough she had in fact done 'impressively' well, she felt judges' comments had made her an object of ridicule, he said.\n\nThe girl, who can not be named for legal reasons, was described as being fascinated by celebrity culture and was determined to become a singer.\n\nShe was said to dress fashionably, but worried about her appearance and kept her bedroom at home 'in complete disarray'.\n\nHer audition on the show was 'not a success' and the judge said, adding: 'Sadly, she now regards the experience as humiliating and she is embarrassed by her performance'.\n\nShe had 'misinterpreted the talent show judges' comments' and viewed what happened as an exercise in ridicule rather than a recognition of her talent.\n\nAfterwards, she dropped out of college, sank into depression and - showing no understanding of 'stranger danger' - began meeting a 'deluge' of men who contacted her on social media.\n\nSome of them were said to have abused or exploited her - sometimes without her consent - and she had become sexually disinhibited, said the judge.\n\nShe began an intense and 'toxic' lesbian relationship with a woman she met online - who turned out to be a Syrian with a 'hoax profile' and a false identity.\n\nSocial workers were eventually put on the alert when the singer's mother called them to say her daughter was threatening to kill herself.\n\nThe girl's mother said that after going on Simon Cowell' show her life had gone 'downhill' (Cowell is pictured third from right with his fellow judges from last year's series)\n\nTALENT SHOWS ACCUSED OF ALLEGEDLY EXPLOITING CONTESTANTS TV talent shows have been criticised in the past for allegedly exploiting contestants with mental health issues. Britain's Got Talent 2009 runner-up Susan Boyle, who revealed in 2013 that she had been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome having previously believed she was brain damaged at birth, was admitted to The Priory clinic, after her surprise defeat in the final. Producers admitted she had been 'exhausted and emotionally drained'. Britain's Got Talent 2009 runner-up Susan Boyle, who revealed in 2013 that she had been diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome having previously believed she was brain damaged at birth, was admitted to The Priory clinic, after her surprise defeat in the final. There is no suggestion that Boyle is involved in this case The UK's most famous talent shows - Britain's Got Talent and the X Factor - have a psychologist on hand for contestants to speak to during the audition process, should they need it. Younger contestants must also be accompanied by a chaperone, and contestants are asked to disclose any concerns they have in advance. Mental health campaigner Jo Brand previously described programmes such as Britain's Got Talent, or The X Factor as 'cruel', while mental health campaigners have also accused the shows of exploiting people with mental health problems. 'I have a huge ambivalence to shows like The X Factor and particularly Britain's Got Talent because I think they wheel on people who have mental health problems for other people to laugh at,' Brand told Radio 4 in 2014. 'I feel very angry about that. 'It is easy for all of us to take the p*** out of someone who thinks they can sing when they can't and I think that's very cruel. 'The field of mental illness is complex because as well as issues like schizophrenia or depression there are lots of other different shades of problems.'\n\nThey argued she did not have the mental 'capacity' to decide where she should live, to look after herself or to form sensible relationships.\n\nThe judge said there was no dispute that the girl , who an IQ of 70, suffers from 'an impairment of the mind'.\n\nHer degree of interest in celebrity and fame was certainly 'unusual' and she had shown 'limited appreciation' of the quality of her performance in the audition.\n\nSocial services bosses had launched Court of Protection proceedings more than a year ago, and the judge said at that stage the woman's mental capacity to 'process key decisions' had been 'significantly in question'.\n\nHowever, having questioned her in court, the judge said she was now more able to cope, and ruled that she did have capacity to manage her own life.\n\nHe said: 'Some risk-taking in adolescents and young adults can be perfectly healthy...healthy risk-taking helps young people to learn'.\n\n'In very many ways she is typical of a young person of her age; she is passionate about music and has some talent in that respect'.\n\nHe added: 'It is well known that young people take risks.\n\n'Risk-taking is often unwise (but) it is also an inherent, inevitable and perhaps necessary part of adolescence and early adulthood experience'.\n\nAlthough her mother currently cooks and cleans for her at home, the judge said she has a group of friends and 'aspires to live independently'.\n\nSome of the risks she took were dangerous but, more recently, she appeared to have 'learned from her mistakes' and led a 'reasonably fulfilling life'.", "images":
