She\u2019s back in contention this year for embodying Queen Elizabeth I opposite Saoirse Ronan as Mary Stuart in the drama, from House of Cards writer Beau Willimon.\n\nIn a scene from director Josie Rourke\u2019s film, exclusive to PEOPLE, Robbie stars as a young Elizabeth, urging her suitor for many years, Robert Dudley (Joe Alwyn), to pursue Mary, who has returned to Scotland to claim her throne.\n\n\u201cDo not ask this of me,\u201d Dudley pleads with Elizabeth.\n\n\u201cIf you wed her, she is ours,\u201d Elizabeth says. \u201cMarry the beautiful queen of Scots and we can control her. With Mary, you too can become prince.\u201d\n\nFocus Features\n\nRobbie shared recently with Harper\u2019s Bazaar that her costars were often intimidated when she was in costume as Elizabeth I \u2014especially when she played the Queen in the years after she was affected by a horrible and scarring bout of small pox.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018Hey, how\u2019s your weekend?\u2019 But they wouldn\u2019t even get close to me,\u201d Robbie, 28, recalls of trying to chat with people while covered with scars and thick white makeup. \u201cIt was very alienating. And I felt very lonely. It was an interesting social experiment.\u201d\n\nRobbie says had to wear layers of prosthetics and makeup to transform into Elizabeth, who often sported the heavy white makeup to cover the scars on her face for the small pox. It made her completely unrecognizable in the role, stripping away the Australian beauty\u2019s distinctive features and glowing blonde hair.\n\nMargot Robbie in Mary Queen of Scots. Parisa Tag/Focus Features\n\n\u201cNormally there\u2019s someone who steps in and says, \u2018No, keep all the girls looking pretty!\u2019\u201d she says of her experience on movie sets. \u201cBut Josie Rourke, the director, was keen to explore how Queen Elizabeth\u2019s looks affected her relationships.\u201d\n\nOf the relationships Elizabeth had, Robbie told Entertainment Weekly earlier this year that her rivalry with Queen Mary of Scotland was born out of manipulation from outside sources. The film deals entirely with their fraught communications.\n\n\u201cEveryone manipulated their relationship,\u201d Robbie told EW of Mary and Elizabeth. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated, it\u2019s tragic, and it\u2019s bizarre. The only other person in the world who could understand the position they were in was each other.\u201d\n\nMary Queen of Scots hits theaters Dec. 7.", "images":
