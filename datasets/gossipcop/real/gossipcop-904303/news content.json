News\u2018 Ryan Seacrest the details of a pre-Golden Globes dinner party he hosted on Saturday night.\n\nA journalist who recently asked Franco if he was enjoying awards season told him about an Oscar dinner Whoopi Goldberg hosted in the past for female nominees. Inspired by her event, Franco threw a celebratory party of his own and invited all of the male Golden Globe nominees for best actor and best supporting actor to a dinner the night before the big event.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d Franco said, adding that he asked himself, \u201cHow many times has this happened?\u201d\n\nFranco broke bread with Tom Hanks, Gary Oldman, Sam Rockwell, Timothee Chalamet, Steve Carell, Richard Jenkins, Hugh Jackman, Ansel Elgort, Armie Hammer and Daniel Kaluuya. The men commemorated the event with a group photo that several shared on social media.\n\nFranco made the big toast of the night, but all of the men went around the room to address the group, Hammer added when speaking to Seacrest on the red carpet. Everyone picked one year and said what they were doing at that point in their life.\n\n\u201cJames put this amazing dinner together and it just humanized the entire thing,\u201d said the Call Me by Your Name star. \u201cWe all sat at one table, in a little quiet room; no press, no nothing. Everybody spoke, everybody got to know each other and it was just an amazing night.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/james_franco.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com//sites/default/files/custom/Annie/unnamed-1.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/james_franco.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Cohen", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/james-franco-hosted-a-dinner-fellow-best-actor-nominees-golden-globes-red-carpet-2018-1072460/", "title": "Golden Globes: James Franco Hosted a Dinner for Fellow Best Actor Nominees", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The 'Disaster Artist' star invited all of the other nominees in his category and best actor, drama, to share a meal before the Golden Globes.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Rebecca Cohen", "tags": "Golden Globes, Golden Globes 2018, James Franco, The Disaster Artist", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Golden Globes: James Franco Hosted a Dinner for Fellow Best Actor Nominees", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/james-franco-hosted-a-dinner-fellow-best-actor-nominees-golden-globes-red-carpet-2018-1072460/", "description": "The 'Disaster Artist' star invited all of the other nominees in his category and best actor, drama, to share a meal before the Golden Globes.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/james_franco.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "James Franco Hosted a Dinner for Fellow Best Actor Nominees | Golden"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-07T16:36:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-07T17:54:04+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 'Disaster Artist' star invited all of the other nominees in his category and best actor, drama, to share a meal before the Golden Globes.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Golden Globes: James Franco Hosted a Dinner for Fellow Best Actor Nominees", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/james_franco.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515342990.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
