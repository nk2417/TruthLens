The group found success with their self-titled album in 1997 but really broke out in 1999 with The Writing\u2019s on the Wall, which featured the hit singles \u201cBills, Bills, Bills,\u201d \u201cJumpin\u2019, Jumpin'\u201d and \u201cSay My Name.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were patient, we worked very hard, and hearing our stuff on the radio? There was nowhere we could go from there but up,\u201d Roberson, now 35, recalls of their early rise. \u201cWe prayed together for the success of the group, and when we started hearing the songs on the radio, started going on tour, we would see how much people really liked Destiny\u2019s Child.\u201d\n\nBut in 2000, everything came to a crashing halt for Roberson.\n\n\u201cI never left Destiny\u2019s Child. That is something that people say. But who would leave Destiny\u2019s Child? That\u2019s crazy! I was dismissed from the group,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was very difficult because of the way that I found out about it. I hate even talking about it, and it\u2019s been 20 years \u2014 but it is what it is. We saw the \u2018Say My Name\u2019 video on TV, and that\u2019s how I found out I was no longer in the group.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Roberson and Luckett did not appear in the video but were replaced by newcomers Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin. (Franklin would leave the group after just months.)\n\n\u201cIt was very difficult. I\u2019m pretty sure that it was difficult for all of us \u2014 because we were young,\u201d Roberson says. \u201cMy issue was always with the management; it was never with the girls.\u201d\n\nEven so, Roberson admits being ousted from the band took a toll on her.\n\n\u201cIt was almost like a bad divorce \u2014 you\u2019re no longer with your friends, people that you love so much. So that was hard in itself,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd then being by myself at that time, when other aspects starting taking ahold of me. It lead me into a depression. And it wasn\u2019t pretty, like at all.\u201d\n\nRedferns Contributor\n\nEven so, Roberson would go on to earn two Grammys for her work on the second Destiny\u2019s Child album and eventually made a foray into television, appearing on TV One\u2019s R&B Divas: Atlanta. And in recent years, Roberson\u2019s taken on the real-life role of mother, welcoming daughter Lyric in 2013.\n\nBut does the former girl group star have any semblance of a relationship with her one-time bandmates?\n\n\u201cI do. It\u2019s not like we speak all the time, but I was chatting with LeToya the day before yesterday. I\u2019ve spoken to Kelly, and I saw Beyonc\u00e9; it\u2019s been years ago, but there\u2019s been nothing but love,\u201d says Roberson, who\u2019s even made peace with the women who replaced her in the group. \u201cI had the opportunity to meet Michelle, I met Farrah, and, again, it was nothing but love.\u201d\n\nAnd Roberson maintains that she\u2019s a fan of her childhood friends\u2019 music.\n\nFor more on LaTavia Roberson, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.\n\n\u201cEverybody has their lives, but I know as far as me being an original member with the girls that I started with? I support all of their careers, and their music\u2019s been guiding me through a lot. It\u2019s been wonderful,\u201d she says, adding that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade and Solange Knowles\u2018 critically acclaimed A Seat at the Table were two particular favorites this year.\n\nIn the end, the new author says there is no bad blood.\n\n\u201cI believe that nothing in life has happened in vain. I believe that things happen for a reason, and there\u2019s nothing but love on my end.\u201d", "images":
