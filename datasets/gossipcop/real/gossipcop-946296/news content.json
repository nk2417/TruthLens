Just ask Sophie Turner, the actress who\u2019s played the tactical Sansa Stark since the beginning. In early June, the actress commemorated the show, which is nearly done shooting its final season, by getting a tattoo of a direwolf along with the message \u201cthe pack survives.\u201d It\u2019s clearly meant to be an ode to family and all things House Stark\u2014but, of course, once they saw it, fans worried that she was somehow giving away the ending of the show.\n\nBut why would she do that? Of course, Turner didn\u2019t spoil anything. The actress stopped by James Corden\u2019s Late Late Show to explain that she was well aware that people might misconstrue the new ink, to the point where friends warned her not to get it.\n\n\u201cWhen I was getting it done, people advised me not to because it looked like I was giving it away. But I wasn\u2019t!\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a quote from last season, but everyone figures that the pack really does survive.\u201d\n\nReally, the quote is \u201cjust a moral that I like to live by,\u201d Turner explained. Just a moral, folks! Just a nice saying. Plus, if you really think that sadist George R.R. Martin is letting this series end without some serious pack division, then perhaps you\u2019ve been watching a different show. Last season may have been surprisingly low on favorite character deaths, but that might have been so HBO can wallop its viewers into Red Wedding flashbacks when Season 8 premieres next year.",
