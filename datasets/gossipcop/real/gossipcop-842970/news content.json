She was 95.\n\nMengering, who for years made regular appearances on Letterman\u2019s Late Show before Thanksgiving and Mother\u2019s Day, died Tuesday at her modest home in Carmel, Ind., according to a rep for the former late-night host.\n\nSeen via satellite from the kitchen of her modest home, Mengering was at her comic best for the feature \u201cGuess Mom\u2019s Pies,\u201d in which Letterman had to pick which one of his many favorites she had lovingly prepared for the holidays.\n\nHer first on-camera appearance on the CBS show came during the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, when she offered to bring ice skater Nancy Kerrigan hot chocolate and asked Hillary Clinton if the first lady could get the speed limit adjusted in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cAfter Lillehammer, I couldn\u2019t believe how it all took off,\u201d she told The New York Times in 1996. \u201cI think it\u2019s about the idea of mom and of a family. People are eager for families to be like they used to be. Even though there are lots of working moms and single-parent families now, you can still be a family in spite of the size and form it takes.\u201d\n\nMengering reprised her role as a Late Show \u201ccorrespondent\u201d for the next two Winter Games in Nagano, Japan and Salt Lake City, and she taped segments from London for Dave as well.\n\nStephen Colbert, who took over for Letterman on The Late Show in 2015, tweeted out his condolences on Tuesday: \u201cI\u2019m so sorry to hear of Dorothy Mengering\u2019s death, and so grateful that Dave shared her with us.\u201d\n\nMengering published a 1996 cookbook, Home Cookin\u2019 With Dave\u2019s Mom. In it were recipes for \u201cDave\u2019s Fried Baloney Sandwich,\u201d \u201cJan\u2019s Sauerkraut Balls\u201d and \u201cGretchen\u2019s Salad Dressing\u201d \u2014 tributes to her son and two daughters \u2014 and instructions for how to make pies like blueberry, sour cherry, pecan molasses and chocolate chiffon.\n\nThe eldest of three children, Dorothy Hofert was born on July 18, 1921, in Linton, Ind. She studied at Indiana University, and in 1942, she married Harry Joseph Letterman, who had a florist shop. He died of a heart attack in 1973. (Dave\u2019s son, Harry, is named after him.)\n\nTen years later, she wed Hans P. Mengering, a retired structural engineer for an Indianapolis architectural firm. The World War II veteran died in March 2013.\n\nIn the interview with The Times, she told a story about how her young son, while working at a local supermarket, once stacked a bunch of cans all the way to the ceiling. Taking one would send them all crashing to the floor.\n\n\u201cI had one of the schoolteachers tell me after Dave got famous that the kids get by with a lot more now,\u201d Mengering said, \u201cbecause they can see it\u2019s not out of meanness, just mischievousness.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dorothy_mengering_david_letterman_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dorothy_mengering_david_letterman_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Barnes", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/obit-dorothy-mengering-dead-795160/", "title": "Dorothy Mengering, David Letterman\u2019s Mom and \u2018Late Show\u2019 Personality, Dies at 95", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Letterman put his elderly mother from Indiana to work, and her bits were always funny and heartwarming.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Mike Barnes", "tags": "David Letterman, Obituaries", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Dorothy Mengering, David Letterman\u2019s Mom and \u2018Late Show\u2019 Personality, Dies at 95", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/obit-dorothy-mengering-dead-795160/", "description": "Letterman put his elderly mother from Indiana to work, and her bits were always funny and heartwarming.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dorothy_mengering_david_letterman_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "Dorothy Mengering Dead: David Letterman's Mom Was 95"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-04-11T19:36:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-04-12T09:50:14+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Letterman put his elderly mother from Indiana to work, and her bits were always funny and heartwarming.", "site": "@thr", "creator": "@mikebarnes4", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Dorothy Mengering, David Letterman\u2019s Mom and \u2018Late Show\u2019 Personality, Dies at 95", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/dorothy_mengering_david_letterman_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491939372.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
