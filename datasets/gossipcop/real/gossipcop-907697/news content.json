News, the motion includes fresh accusations against Bankson, alleging that also in 2014, she obtained the username, password and security answers for Kris\u2019 daughter Kourtney's AOL account and gained access to her emails.\n\nIt is unknown at the time of writing if Kourtney, 38, is one of the two unnamed family members from the 2016 filing, or if the accusations are completely new.\n\nBankston\u2019s motion filing comes as her defence says she has the right to be prosecuted where the alleged crimes took place, rather than in California, where the \u2018Keeping Up with the Kardashians\u2019 stars live.\n\nThe documents state: \"The Constitution and the federal rules of criminal procedure protect [Bankston\u2019s] right to be prosecuted in the federal judicial district where the alleged crimes occurred, rather than in a district convenient to the government or its celebrity complaining witnesses.\u201d\n\nThe alleged hacker was also accused of hacking Kris' Instagram account and publicly posting disparaging comments about her family under the reality star's name, and posting Kris and relatives' phone numbers.\n\nIn 2016, Bankston was indicted for six counts of stalking, four counts of computer hacking, one count of extortion by threat and four counts\n\nof aggravated identity theft related to the computer hacking offences. Bankston is set for a court hearing on February 5.\n\nBang Showbiz", "images": ["https://www.iol.co.za/_next/static/media/iol.2d0c9660.svg", "https://www.iol.co.za/_next/static/media/iol.f8693d09.svg", "https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/8f4da3a768f0c60bf2e36cbdc2588810065e7181/1000/jpeg", "https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/8f4da3a768f0c60bf2e36cbdc2588810065e7181=w700"], "top_img": "https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/8f4da3a768f0c60bf2e36cbdc2588810065e7181/1000/jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://iol.co.za/entertainment/celebrity-news/2018-01-22-kris-jenners-alleged-stalker-hacked-into-kourtneys-emails/", "title": "Kris Jenner\u2019s alleged stalker hacked into Kourtney's emails", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The hacker was also accused of hacking Kris' Instagram account and publicly posting disparaging comments about her family under the reality star's name.", "article": {"publisher": "https://iol.co.za", "published_time": 1516611600000, "author": "Bang Showbiz", "section": "Entertainment"}, "IE=edge": "X-UA-Compatible", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "4BE9A236252D15311B31D1EA103EE632", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=479535200", "fb": {"app_id": 293175074032541}, "google-site-verification": "iQCzO2whcLNU6_F3xi1Dck7JMALz7869mBLTQf08wJo", "facebook-domain-verification": "m85xaz5xdy8fiifyys11g0z5i7e2b0", "og": {"title": "Kris Jenner\u2019s alleged stalker hacked into Kourtney's emails", "description": "The hacker was also accused of hacking Kris' Instagram account and publicly posting disparaging comments about her family under the reality star's name.", "url": "https://iol.co.za/entertainment/celebrity-news/2018-01-22-kris-jenners-alleged-stalker-hacked-into-kourtneys-emails/", "site_name": "IOL", "locale": "en-ZA", "image": {"identifier": "https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/8f4da3a768f0c60bf2e36cbdc2588810065e7181/1000/jpeg", "width": 1000}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IOL", "creator": "@IOL", "title": "Kris Jenner\u2019s alleged stalker hacked into Kourtney's emails", "description": "The hacker was also accused of hacking Kris' Instagram account and publicly posting disparaging comments about her family under the reality star's name.", "image": {"identifier": "https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/8f4da3a768f0c60bf2e36cbdc2588810065e7181/1000/jpeg", "width": 1000}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.iol.co.za", "summary": ""}
