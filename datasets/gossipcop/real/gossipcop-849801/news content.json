Having movie reviewers see it for you!\n\nLos Angeles Times critic Jen Yamato was in the Enjoy It for What It Is camp, describing the film thusly: \u201c[I]t not only owns its dumbness but hurtles itself all the way back around through a flurry of genitalia jokes and F-bombs to splash unapologetically in an R-rated surf of winking postmodernism, led by the charismatic Dwayne Johnson, Hollywood\u2019s most unsinkable movie star.\u201d\n\nBut although not everyone hates it \u2014 64% of audiences dug it, according to Rotten Tomatoes \u2014 a lot of reviewers put the bouncing-beach-bodies flick firmly in its place, damning it, and then damning it with faint praise.\n\nThat said, here are a few snacks, both bad and (relatively) good, from the \u201cBaywatch\u201d snark buffet.\n\nOver at the Chicago Tribune, they took the \u201cYeah, and ...?\u201d approach to the review.\n\nThe Bad: \u201cThe movie\u2019s comic instincts... are consistently coarse and frequently scrotal.\u201d\n\nThe Good: \u201cThe bodies on screen are pretty, which I seem to remember was a selling point of the 1989-2001 TV series.\u201d\n\nAs we said, yeah, and ...?\n\nThe Roger Ebert website perhaps cut closest to the bone, pulling few punches.\n\nThe Bad: \u201c[T]his is another one of those raunchy comedies that\u2019s barely a movie, that looks like it was edited by dumping a bunch of footage into whatever movie-cutting software they\u2019re using and hitting \u2018randomize.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Good: \u201c[T]he movie has a pervading air of crass amiability about it \u2014 it\u2019s almost like a two-hour end-credits gag reel. (Nevertheless, it contains an end credits gag reel.)\n\nNow could you tell us what you really think?:\n\nRolling Stone painted a vivid picture of the \u201cBaywatch\u201d experience.\n\nThe Bad: \u201cThink of yourself sitting down for a big two-hour wallow in instant stupid with a vat of popcorn, slathered in fake butter and possibly a mound of melted M&Ms on top. It feels great chugging it down, then your stomach hurts, your head aches and you puke the whole thing up so you can forget about it in the morning. That\u2019s \u2018Baywatch\u2019 in a nutshell. Happy puking.\u201d\n\nThe Good: \u201cOf the recent spate of moldy TV material morphing into movies, with \u201921 Jump Street\u2019 on top and \u2018CHIPs\u2019 bringing up the rear, \u2018Baywatch\u2019 barely escapes the basement. One reason it does: The Rock.\u201d\n\nHelpful! Turns out if you liked \u201c21 Jump Street\u201d and \u201cCHiPs,\u201d this flick is for you!\n\nThe New York Times loosened up its necktie for this one.\n\nThe Bad: \u201cThe digital effects \u2014 fire and water, mostly \u2014 are lackluster, and the whole thing has a crummy, overcast, second-rate-theme-park look to it.\u201d\n\nThe Good: \u201cLike its source material, \u201cBaywatch\u201d is sleazy and wholesome, silly and earnest, dumb as a box of sand and slyly self-aware. It\u2019s soft-serve ice cream. Crinkle-cut fries. A hot car and a skin rash. Tacky and phony and nasty and also kind of fun.\u201d\n\nTacky? Phony? Nasty? We didn\u2019t know it was a date movie.\n\nThe Washington Post, of course, just couldn\u2019t leave politics out of it.\n\nThe Bad: \u201cIt\u2019s no shock that the women in \u2018Baywatch\u2019 don\u2019t have much to do beyond look good. ... Maybe dodging bad lines was a relief for the actresses. It\u2019s not like the screenplay, by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, gives performers a lot to work with.\u201d\n\nThe Good: \u201cIf, indeed, Dwayne \u2018the Rock\u2019 Johnson ditches Hollywood to become our next commander in chief, \u2018Baywatch\u2019 may be singled out as the low point of his pre-political career.\u201d\n\nWell, at least Johnson has that out of the way.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Times went deadpan.\n\nThe Bad: \u201cImagining Johnson and genetically gifted co-stars in swimsuits is all it took to pitch Baywatch. Director Seth Gordon and six writers didn\u2019t come up with much beyond that.\u201d\n\nThe Good: \u201cWhat Baywatch has in its favor is Dwayne Johnson fireman-carrying a dead weight comedy to safety.\u201d\n\nWe think that\u2019s a compliment. Maybe.\n\nVariety noted the film\u2019s nods to current market and societal trends.\n\nThe Bad: \u201c\u2018Baywatch\u2019 ... is a stupidly entertaining trash folly, the kind that could only be made today: an obscenity-and-insult-laced, aggressively \u2018competent\u2019 adaptation of a 25-year-old TV show that manages to repackage every aspect of the series except, perhaps, the reason it was popular in the first place.\n\nThe Good: \u201cThey wear their butt-hugging red bathing suits with dignity and pride, which makes this a highly sexually responsible \u2018Baywatch.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe reviewer at the New York Post appeared to be familiar with the TV series\u2019 global success.\n\nThe Bad: \u201cEven the action scenes need CPR, often undermined by effects so chintzy, you wonder if the money intended for them was instead eaten up by the production\u2019s seven-figure waxing budget.\u201d\n\nThe Good: \u201cOn the bright side, it\u2019ll probably do killer business in Germany.\u201d\n\nWait, were they just dissing the Hoff?\n\nFinally, one need go no further than the AV Club to understand Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 19% positive critics\u2019 rating.\n\nThe Bad: \u201c[N]obody \u2014not even the filmmakers \u2014cares about \u2018Baywatch\u2019 all that much. Yet the joke\u2019s on them: In spoofing something so forgettable, they\u2019ve made something even less memorable.\u201d\n\nThe Good: \u201cNobody cares about \u2018Baywatch.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2018Nuff said.", "images":
