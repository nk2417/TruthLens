The music icon was taking questions from reporters at the launch of her new handbag collection in her home city of Montreal Wednesday when one male journalist decided to dive a little deeper.\n\n\u201cHow are things going? It\u2019s a whole new world for you,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cYou\u2019re a single woman now.\u201d\n\nDion didn\u2019t miss a beat when she quipped back, \u201cAre you asking me out?\u201d Before the journalist could formulate a full answer, she burst into song, crooning Rihanna\u2019s \u201cDiamonds\u201d as a way to answer his question.\n\nWhen the same reporter then attempted to ask her once more about her love life, Dion didn\u2019t relent. \u201cWe going out or what?\u201d she asked with a smile, to which he asked, \u201cAre you free tonight?\u201d\n\nAt that cue, Dion burst out in song again, this time belting out the chorus to Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cFree Fallin\u2019.\u201d\n\nDion even gave a nod to Marvin Gaye\u2019s 1971 track, \u201cWhat\u2019s Goin\u2019 On\u201d when another reporter asked the question aloud in confusion.\n\nFinally, though, the singer managed to eke out a more serious answer, telling the gathered fans that she\u2019s been taking life one day at a time since her husband, Rene Angelil, and her brother, Daniel Dion, died within days of one another in January 2016.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m enjoying myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI went through a lot. At this time of my life, going back a few years back when it was so hard, I feel as though I can spread my wings. \u2026 There is a force that takes over when you believe, and I\u2019m a believer.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/celine-dion-199600e1-ec03-4773-aa83-f84fc7e6b019.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/celine-dion-199600e1-ec03-4773-aa83-f84fc7e6b019.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/celine-dion-sings-rihanna-tom-petty-songs-when-asked-about-her-love-life-202560/", "title": "Celine Dion Sings Rihanna Song When Asked About Love Life", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Celine Dion, whose husband Rene Angelil died last year, keeps the mood light during event after reporter asks her whether she's still single.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Joyce Chen", "tags": "Celine Dion", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Celine Dion Sings Rihanna, Tom Petty When Asked About Her Love Life", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/celine-dion-sings-rihanna-tom-petty-songs-when-asked-about-her-love-life-202560/", "description": "Celine Dion, whose husband Rene Angelil died last year,  keeps the mood light during event after reporter asks her whether she's still single.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/celine-dion-199600e1-ec03-4773-aa83-f84fc7e6b019.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "width": 1401, "height": 788, "alt": "NICE, FRANCE - JULY 20: Celine Dion performs at Allianz Riviera Stadium on July 20, 2017 in Nice, France.
