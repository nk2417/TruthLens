Kate Middleton, who is currently expecting her third child, recycled her black Diane von Furstenberg Zarita gown \u2014 which she wore back in 2014 while she was pregnant with Princess Charlotte \u2014 for the special occasion.\n\nPrince Harry\u2019s girlfriend Meghan Markle owns a shorter, navy version of the Duchess\u2019 DVF gown. Kate, 35, completed her elegant ensemble on November 7 by styling her glossy locks down in loose waves. The mom-of-two accessorized her look with a Prada clutch, a pair of Queen Elizabeth\u2019s earrings, a diamond cuff bracelet and a patriotic Remembrance Poppy.\n\nKate is pregnant with her and Prince William's third child Photo: Frank Augstein - WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nPHOTOS: ALL THE TIMES THE DUCHESS OF CAMBRIDGE HAS REWORN LOOKS\n\nKate, who recently returned to her royal duties after battling severe morning sickness, appeared to be in great spirits as she conversed with guests in the Orangery at Kensington Palace. The Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, of which the Duchess is patron, campaigns for a step change in children\u2019s mental health and believes in the importance of early intervention. During the reception, Kate met with key supporters of the charity as well as families who benefit from it.\n\nThe Duchess showed off a hint of her growing baby bump at the gala dinner on November 7 Photo: Frank Augstein - WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nGALLERY: THE ROYAL PIECES KATE HAS BORROWED FROM THE QUEEN\n\nKensington Palace noted that Prince William's wife \u201chas a continued desire to draw attention to child mental health issues, and the important work that [the Anna Freud Centre] is doing in this space.\u201d Last week, Kate hosted a secret meeting to discuss maternal mental health.
