The film tells the story of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who notoriously murdered their parents in 1989. It premieres June 11th.\n\nAlong with Love, Menendez stars Nico Tortorella and Myko Olivier as brothers Lyle and Erik, and Benito Martinez as the family patriarch, Jose Menendez. The new trailer highlights the abuse Jose inflicted upon his sons, as well as Kitty\u2019s inability to protect her sons or stop her husband. In quintessential Lifetime movie fashion, the trailer boasts a scene in which Kitty looks nervously into a mirror in a dark room while whispering in a voice over, \u201cJust get through this day Kitty, tomorrow will be different.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the clip, the Menendez brothers plot and carry out their parents\u2019 murder and enjoy a surprise respite of freedom before the swift hammer of justice comes down \u2013 which of course prompts some furious telephone smashing in a seedy motel room.\n\nThe Menendez brothers\u2019 trial became became a national sensation as the brothers testified about their father\u2019s history of abuse. After a deadlocked jury and mistrial, Erik and Lyle were retried and convicted on two counts of first-degree murder. In 1996, they were sentenced to life without parole, and are currently serving time in separate prisons.\n\nAlong with Lifetime\u2019s Menendez: Blood Brothers, Law & Order creator Dick Wolf is working on a true crime spin-off of his hit series that will debut with an eight-episode first season about the Menendez brothers.", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mendez-love-8836faab-ccfe-422b-a28a-c301fade931d.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mendez-love-8836faab-ccfe-422b-a28a-c301fade931d.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jon Blistein", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/see-courtney-love-chew-scenery-in-menendez-brothers-movie-trailer-117278/", "title": "See Courtney Love Chew Scenery in Menendez Brothers Movie Trailer", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Courtney Love stars as Kitty Menendez in the melodramatic trailer for Lifetime's original movie, 'Menendez: Blood Brothers.'", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Jon Blistein", "tags": "Courtney Love", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "See Courtney Love Chew Scenery in Menendez Brothers Movie Trailer", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/see-courtney-love-chew-scenery-in-menendez-brothers-movie-trailer-117278/", "description": "Courtney Love stars as Kitty Menendez in the melodramatic trailer for Lifetime's original movie, 'Menendez: Blood Brothers.'", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mendez-love-8836faab-ccfe-422b-a28a-c301fade931d.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "width": 1401, "height": 788, "alt": "Courtney Love in MENDEZ BLOOD BROTHERS - Lifetime"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-18T20:23:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T16:03:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Courtney Love stars as Kitty Menendez in the melodramatic trailer for Lifetime's original movie, 'Menendez: Blood Brothers.'", "site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "See Courtney Love Chew Scenery in Menendez Brothers Movie Trailer", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mendez-love-8836faab-ccfe-422b-a28a-c301fade931d.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495138984.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
