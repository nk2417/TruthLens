Sometimes steering forty thousand successful crime procedurals simply isn\u2019t enough, especially when a young upstart like Ryan Murphy swoops in and places hilarious wigs on A-list talent and then gobbles up Emmy awards like the Hamburglar. Dick Wolf has been doing ripped-from-the-headlines, arguably campy crime retellings for what feels like centuries now! How had he suddenly found himself bested at his own game? So it\u2019s time, finally, for him to show everyone how it\u2019s done. Ladies and gentlemen, the names have not been changed: Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders is here.\n\nUnfortunately, the Menendez family killings are no O.J. Simpson trial. For one thing, we already know who the killers are, whereas there are people in the world who still don\u2019t fully know (or accept) the common consensus about who murdered Nicole Brown Simpson. Further, the O.J. trial was about much more than O.J. Simpson while, at best, the Menendez trial allowed Inside Edition to fawn over a couple of hunks for a few months. That being said, this is a Law & Order series, so its production values are top-notch and the cast is wonderful. And yes, it absolutely steps to American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson\u2018s wig game. For that reason alone, Dick Wolf has another winner on his hands. Let\u2019s get into what works about it.\n\nThat is a lot of words for a title, but in my opinion they are accurate! This is definitely a true crime series from the makers of Law & Order about the Menendez murders. And it\u2019s not just a branding thing\u2026 this series maintains the original procedurals\u2019 format by alternating between cops and lawyers, with dramatic flashbacks mixed in:\n\nIt\u2019s also, uh, pretty frank with its onscreen violence:\n\nWhereas The People v. O.J. Simpson was remarkably restrained when it came to its depiction of the inciting incident, this thing began with the onscreen, graphic shotgunning of Jose & Kitty Menendez in their living room. Which, strong choice, I guess?\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe series\u2019 first hour showed how the Beverly Hills police department initially ruled out sons Lyle & Erik Menendez as suspects on account of them being upright, tennis playing, rich hunks from a respected family. No lie detector tests, very polite interrogations, stuff like that. Though, to be fair, the mustachioed detective walked into the crime scene openly trash-talking rich folks, so we were definitely meant to take note of the class issues at play here. Because, as we were about to find out, sometimes rich hunks DO murder.\n\nThe actors playing Erik and Lyle Menendez are perfect on several levels, but Lyle\u2019s wig was especially hilarious. He\u2019s introduced as the calm, robotic sociopath with a fondness for Rolexes while Erik was the shy, traumatized one whose favorite hobby was sobbing on the floor. And because we already know they are the killers, the episode mostly focused on how badly they planned the hit, up to and including going on a shopping spree three days after their parents\u2019 murder (and charging everything to their father\u2019s credit card). Slightly suspicious, guys.\n\nBut let\u2019s be real, if you tuned into this premiere, you came to see its star: EDIE FALCO\u2019S WIG. And it is glorious. That masterpiece receives top billing for a reason.\n\nSecond billing goes to Edie Falco herself, as the bros\u2019 eventual attorney Leslie Abramson. And yes, she too is wonderful. Not sure if she\u2019ll ever reach Sarah Paulson levels of transcendence, but so far the parallels between the two shows are clear: A strong, competent lawyer with an incredible perm just happens to get roped into the case of her lifetime. But in this case, Abramson\u2019s READY for the challenge. (Mostly because she\u2019d made a career defending justifiable homicide, and she knew the brothers were killers the second she laid eyes on them.)\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe third biggest star was probably the ferret living on Kitty Menendez\u2019s bathroom counter. Look at that little guy! What did he know? Who did he see? We did not see a scene of the detectives interrogating the ferret via a pet psychic, but hopefully that will come in future episodes.\n\nKitty Menendez herself was played in flashbacks by the great Lolita Davidovich, who is very good at sobbing in bed and also getting murdered. Will Kitty do more than these things in future episodes? We\u2019ll just have to stay tuned.\n\nElizabeth Reaser plays a deputy district attorney who only showed up for one scene, mostly to show off her unhip 1989-era detective outfit. Also, disappointingly she seemed to be not wearing a wig, so that seemed like a missed opportunity. I\u2019m thinking braids with beads would have looked great here.\n\nPlaying Edie Falco\u2019s perm\u2019s husband is True Blood\u2018s Chris Bauer who was ALSO in The People v. O.J. Simpson. Relax, Dick Wolf. We\u2019re already on board! Anyway, this was the glimpse into Leslie Abramson\u2019s personal life: She was already parent to a grown child but looking to adopt a baby. Between this and her career and also basic perm maintenance, this lady sure can manage her time!\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis is how Josh Charles looks in this thing. No complaints here, obviously. He plays a shady-seeming therapist on the Menendez\u2019 boys\u2019 payroll. It was unclear how he\u2019ll factor into the saga (I honestly have no recollection of most of this case), but we definitely needed to know that he was currently cheating on his wife with an especially horny Heather Graham:\n\nAnd I am still laughing about Heather Graham\u2019s wig. It is low-key almost as good as Edie Falco\u2019s. Those wispy asymmetrical bangs! Man, 1989 was a rough year.\n\nRounding out the familiar faces was Anthony Edwards as some random judge on one of Leslie Abramson\u2019s cases. We could tell the two were very adversarial and frenemies at best, so something tells me he\u2019ll get assigned to the Menendez case later. Just a hunch!\n\nAgain, because the seemingly straightforward real-life saga has been divided into eight parts, \u201cEpisode 1\u201d didn\u2019t have much a twist or cliffhanger to end on. Mostly just the idea that Erik Menendez (the sensitive one) was poised to confess his part in the murder at any given moment. But, again, duh. Aside from simply shading in the details and providing insight on angles we hadn\u2019t considered, the main purpose of L&OTC: The Menendez Murders is simple recreation, not innovative storytelling. But it\u2019s well done and at eight episodes seems like a tidy little journey that hopefully won\u2019t overstay its welcome.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nVERDICT: Sure.\n\n\u201cEpisode 1\u201d was fun enough \u2014 again, those wigs! \u2014 and the Law & Order house style (complete with that immortal chung-chung sound effect) remains essentially perfect entertainment. And there is something compelling about the idea of a Law & Order-style show that is both serialized and procedural. Also it\u2019s about real people! In 1989! I\u2019m not as immediately blown away by it as I was with The People v. O.J. Simpson, but until Ryan Murphy\u2019s franchise returns, this seems like as good a bet as any. Congratulations, Dick Wolf. Will you watch again?
