The singers released their \u201cYouth\u201d video today (Nov. 5), and it\u2019s all about the power of young people.\n\nExplore Khalid Shawn Mendes See latest videos, charts and news\n\nThe seven-minute video starts out with a ceramic gun crashing to the ground, followed by a series of footage from this year\u2019s March For Our Lives rally. Before the song begins, Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor David Hogg delivers a line that sets up the rest of the impactful video in a poignant way: \u201cIf you listen real close, you can hear the people in power shaking.\u201d\n\nIn between shots of Shawn and Khalid singing \u201cYouth,\u201d the video shows several kids and teenagers doing their craft, whether it\u2019s painting, wrestling, debating, playing piano or dancing ballet. It\u2019s an empowering way to give youth and their talents the spotlight, and proof that if you put your mind and passion into something, anything is possible \u2014 no matter how old you are.\n\nThat powerful message plays into the need for younger generations to vote in the midterm elections, which is exactly why Khalid and Shawn released their video when they did. Both of them shared the video on Instagram, captioned with a line that sums everything up perfectly. \u201cOur youth is our strength, our vote is our voice.\u201d\n\nWatch the \u201cYouth\u201d video below.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-bbmas-2018-live-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=628&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-bbmas-2018-live-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-bbmas-2018-live-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Taylor Weatherby", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/shawn-mendes-khalid-video-youth-8483246/", "title": "Shawn Mendes & Khalid Unveil Empowering \u2018Youth\u2019 Video Ahead Of Midterm Elections: Watch", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Shawn Mendes and Khalid released their &quot;Youth&quot; video today (Nov. 5), and it's all about the power of young people.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Taylor Weatherby", "tags": "bbnews", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Shawn Mendes & Khalid Unveil Empowering \u2018Youth\u2019 Video Ahead Of Midterm Elections: Watch", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/shawn-mendes-khalid-video-youth-8483246/", "description": "Shawn Mendes and Khalid released their \"Youth\" video today (Nov. 5), and it's all about the power of young people.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-bbmas-2018-live-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Khalid Shawn Mendes"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-11-05T19:22:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-06T16:57:01+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Shawn Mendes and Khalid released their \"Youth\" video today (Nov. 5), and it's all about the power of young people.", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Shawn Mendes & Khalid Unveil Empowering \u2018Youth\u2019 Video Ahead Of Midterm Elections: Watch", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-bbmas-2018-live-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1541445772.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
