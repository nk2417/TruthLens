Big Brother alum Natalie Negrotti revealed that she is pansexual and dating a woman during the Tuesday, July 17, episode of The Challenge: Final Reckoning. She also claimed that Kayleigh Morris outed her on social media following the huge fight during Vendettas, in which other women in the house threw Kaleigh\u2019s luggage over the balcony. While Natalie claims she was not part of the \u201cmean girls\u201d moment, as the show phrased it, Kaleigh didn\u2019t believe her, later calling her a \u201clesbian\u201d on social media.\n\nRelated: 5 Greatest Moments in \u2018The Challenge\u2019 History Ever since its 1998 debut, MTV\u2019s The Challenge has been filled with exciting moments. So much so, that Us Weekly has put together a gallery of some of the most memorable through the years \u2014 although it was tough to narrow it down. When it comes to finales, Rivals III still takes the cake as [\u2026]\n\n\u201cShe did it in a really malicious way, and that\u2019s what really hurt me. The way she did it. She was saying, \u2018She doesn\u2019t even like d\u2014k, she likes p\u2014sy. She\u2019s a lesbian.\u2019 I\u2019m not a lesbian, I\u2019m pansexual,\u201d Natalie, 28, told Us Weekly on the \u201cWatch With Us\u201d podcast. \u201cShe outed me in a really aggressive way and kept going. It was really homophobic in a way. To me, that\u2019s getting gay shamed. Then there was a whole bunch of people that started gay-shaming me, calling me a \u2018dyke,\u2019 going on my social media and attacking me for being gay.\u201d\n\nNatalie wasn\u2019t ready to come out \u2013 and didn\u2019t plan on doing so on the show. In fact, she hadn\u2019t told her family at the time of Kayleigh\u2019s comments. Since, she has called everyone and was forced to open up about everything.\n\nRelated: Celebrities\u2019 Coming Out Stories Take a look back at LGBT celebrities' emotional, inspiring coming out stories from over the years -- including Wentworth Miller, Ellen Page, Jodie Foster and more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a 28-year battle for me,\u201d Natalie said. \u201cI wanted to set a standard because you can\u2019t do that. There are so many teenagers and kids that commit suicide every year because they get outed inappropriately. She took something that was mine and made it her own, and she did it really in a nasty way. Outing someone is not right and I want to set that standard \u2026 I wanted to come out in the right way, I wanted to turn it into something positive so that viewers that are going through the same thing that I\u2019ve gone through don\u2019t have to go through it for 28 years.\u201d\n\nNatalie also revealed she is in an exclusive relationship with a woman, who she describes as her \u201cbiggest supporter.\u201d After Vendettas, Natalie and Johnny Bananas dated casually while both seeing other people. Ultimately, it just didn\u2019t work.\n\nRelated: Couples Who\u2019ve Survived the Reality TV Curse Who says true love doesn\u2019t exist on reality TV? While it seems to be a trend that many marriages on reality TV end in divorce, there are still some reality TV couples out there beating the odds. Big Brother\u2018s Nicole Franzel and Victor Arroyo met while filming season 18 of Big Brother in 2016. The timing [\u2026]\n\nThe former NFL cheerleader added: \u201cShe\u2019s a really great fit for me, and she\u2019s really special to me.\u201d\n\nListen to the podcast above to hear more about Natalie\u2019s journey, what happened between she and Johnny, how it\u2019s been working with Paul Calafiore and more.
