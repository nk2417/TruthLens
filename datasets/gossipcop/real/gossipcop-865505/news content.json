It's called \"Blue's Freestyle/We Family\" and features a 45-second rap from the rapper's 5-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy.\n\nThe budding music titan starts her flow with: \"Everything, everything is my only single thing/Everything I hear is my answer ... I never hear that/I be in the posse/Never seen a ceiling in my whole life.\"\n\nThe daughter of JAY-Z and Beyonce finishes by rapping, \"Boom shakalaka/Boom shakalaka/Everything in shaka/ Everything in faka.\"\n\nJAY-Z's physical \"4:44\" album also features two other bonus songs. One is \"Adnis,\" named after the rapper's father, Adnis Reeves.\n\nThe other is \"MaNyfaCedGod,\" featuring James Blake. It touches on marital issues with his wife, Beyonce, which he's been open about on what is the artist's 13th album.\n\nIn fact, JAY-Z ponders what would happen if the couple split. \"Cost me 2 mil for some child support/would get the money back but not the child support,\" he raps.\n\nThis isn't the first time Blue Ivy has played a part in her parents' music. She was featured on her father's 2012 single, \"Glory,\" released right after she was born. It was then that she became the youngest person to appear on the Billboard charts. She was also on Beyonce's 2013 self-titled album on a song called \"Blue.\"", "images": ["https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/bf2f8ed5-a320-4d7e-b583-179abe072d92/trump-signs-shutdown-bill-20251112-ap-jh_1763006747268_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/009e3420-a5ae-477a-aeb3-edfa85648814/johnson-2-gty-jef-251118_1763480583977_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a904a3c1-1e2d-4174-9130-e846e8059dee/carnivaldeath_1762746067738_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-Blue-Ivy-JayZ-MEM-170707_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/7669390d-d027-4ec7-9673-1d2eccafbbec/comey-gty-er-251117_1763404424377_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-Blue-Ivy-JayZ-MEM-170707_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "https://assets-cdn.abcotvs.net/static/images/DisneyPlus.svg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-Blue-Ivy-JayZ-MEM-170707_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/blue-ivy-freestyles-jay-zs-444-bonus-track/story?id=48497353", "title": "Blue Ivy freestyles on JAY-Z's '4:44' bonus track called 'We Family'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/blue-ivy-freestyles-jay-zs-444-bonus-track/story?id=48497353", "title": "Blue Ivy freestyles on JAY-Z's '4:44'  bonus track called 'We Family'", "description": "The internet is already calling her the princess of rap.", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-Blue-Ivy-JayZ-MEM-170707_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "type": "article"}, "description": "The internet is already calling her the princess of rap.", "keywords": "Blue Ivy freestyle, Blue Ivy raps, Article, 48497353", "theme-color": "#fff", "copyright": "2025 ABC News", "author": "ABC News", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "Blue Ivy freestyles on JAY-Z's '4:44'  bonus track called 'We Family'", "lastPublishedDate": "2017-07-08T06:43:07Z", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,48497353", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,48497353", "googleplay": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/blue-ivy-freestyles-jay-zs-444-bonus-track/story?id=48497353"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "ABC News", "title": "Blue Ivy freestyles on JAY-Z's '4:44'  bonus track called 'We Family'", "description": "The internet is already calling her the princess of rap.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/blue-ivy-freestyles-jay-zs-444-bonus-track/story?id=48497353", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-Blue-Ivy-JayZ-MEM-170707_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "width": 640, "height": 360}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,48497353", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,48497353", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for ipad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/blue-ivy-freestyles-jay-zs-444-bonus-track/story?id=48497353", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/blue-ivy-freestyles-jay-zs-444-bonus-track/story?id=48497353"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
