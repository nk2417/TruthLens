{"url": "https://people.com/style/armie-hammer-retires-adidas-tracksuit/", "text": "Cue Sarah McLachlan\u2019s \u201cAngel.\u201d\n\nArmie Hammer, who earlier this year went through a period where he exclusively wore Adidas tracksuits, announced on Conan Tuesday that he\u2019s officially done with the look for good. The Call Me by Your Name actor starting wearing the suits at the end of January while promoting the film in Paris, and continued wearing the comfy style \u2014 to internet acclaim \u2014 for weeks.\n\nHammer explained the origin story of his athleisure phase to Conan O\u2019Brien, saying that after a 14-month period of doing CMBYN press he had \u201cdeveloped a case of what I like to call \u2018the f\u2014 its,'\u201d and that he \u201cbasically had senioritis.\u201d (For those who were immune in high school, \u201csenioritis\u201d is when you just can\u2019t anymore at the end of high school.) So the outfit came about because he realized \u201cIf I\u2019m gonna continue to jump through these hoops and I\u2019m gonna continue to talk about this movie that I\u2019ve talked about ad nauseum, I\u2019m gonna be comfortable.\u201d\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: Every Time Armie Hammer Has Worn an Adidas Tracksuit, a.k.a. \u2018Le Tracksuit\u2019\n\nThe look went onto become somewhat of a sartorial sensation, with Hammer\u2019s wife Elizabeth Chambers dubbing it \u201cLe Tracksuit\u201d and posting additional behind-the-scenes photos throughout the tour. (It even inspired this writer to compile each time he wore them on Instagram into a photo gallery). Supermodel and Adidas ambassador Kendall Jenner even went so far as to say the actor was \u201ckilling it right now with his tracksuits.\u201d\n\nBut soon, Hammer started to wear human clothes more and more, and we felt the tracksuits slipping away. Just before the Oscars, Chambers told W she was surprised the suits had received so much attention in the first place. \u201cHe\u2019s completely over tracksuits now. He\u2019s like, \u2018Nope, they are becoming too popular. I\u2019m over it.'\u201d She added what may have been the nail in the coffin for \u201cLe Tracksuit\u201d: \u201cI thought we were taking it a little too far.\u201d\n\nAnd Tuesday, Hammer made it official: \u201cI would like to take this moment to officially announce my retirement from tracksuits. I\u2019m done,\u201d he announced to the TV host. \u201cI got oversaturated and burned out on tracksuits.\u201d He explained that right when he was over the style, \u201cthey started pouring in.\u201d So how many did he end up with, when all was said and done? \u201cI have 70 tracksuits in my closet. That is not even hyperbole.\u201d\n\nHammer even listed some of the major designers who have sent him suits in the last few months. \u201cTom Ford offered to custom-make me a tracksuit. And really the icing on the cake? Oscar Mayer wieners sent me a tracksuit.\u201d\n\nAnd after amassing 70 matching sets, the actor has suits to spare, even offering to share with the 6-ft-4-in. host: \u201cYou and I could share tracksuits! We\u2019re the same size. Do you want tracksuits?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will wear your tracksuits, but only if they\u2019ve been pre-worn by you,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, to which Hammer replied, \u201cI\u2019ve never washed a tracksuit.\u201d", "images":
