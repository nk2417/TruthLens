Unfortunately, heat damage doesn\u2019t stop at those styling tools. Diffusing your hair can cause heat damage as well. If you\u2019re a wash n go gal who diffuses daily, then you may want to consider laying off the diffuser. Natural hair guru Naptural85 recently cut off quite a bit of hair due to diffusing and coloring. She broke down her experience in this YouTube video.\n\nWhitney admitted that her excessive diffusing (in addition to coloring) lead to her heat damage. Additionally, she explains that pulling down her hair for length while diffusing, caused a lot of heat damage in the back of her head. While she may have had fun with her hair, it wasn\u2019t worth the headache in the end. Whitney is now on a journey to get back the length she lost, plus some. She plans on regaining the length lost by doing less wash and go\u2019s and more twist outs.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t mean that you have to give up diffusing completely, but it does mean that you have to be more careful. Here are 3 ways diffusing can cause heat damage.\n\nLingering Heat\n\nAlthough diffusing is least likely to cause heat damage, it\u2019s still attached to a blow dryer. Naturals often shy away from blow dryers because they blow heat directly onto the hair and zap moisture very quickly. Even though the diffuser doesn\u2019t have the same effect, it can still cause damage if it is left on a section of hair for too long. Move it around and let the air from the dryer distribute evenly.\n\nHigh Heat\n\nThis sounds like a no-brainer, but for some it isn\u2019t. When diffusing, don\u2019t place the heat setting on high. Some naturals can handle the high heat at full force and never experience visible damage, but everyone\u2019s hair is different. Just like flat irons and curling irons, high heat on a blow dryer can cause severe heat damage, even if it\u2019s through a diffuser.\n\nDiffusing Daily\n\nDiffusing too often is another way to damage your hair. I\u2019ve noticed a big difference in the health of hair from naturals who diffuse once every three or four days. However, if you must diffuse daily, use a warm or cool setting.\n\nWhat are some of your tips for preventing heat damage when diffusing?", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/bglh-marketplace.com/wp-content/uploads/woocommerce-placeholder.png?resize=500%2C500&ssl=1", "https://bglh-marketplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/hair-dryer-diffuser-clipped-tutorial-for-men-hair-care.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8fc2efb0aad0f07e69c7f306e727dc8a767aa4a4132010abfeee606aa2884ac8?s=300&d=identicon&r=x", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/eaac2bbd7642e1ea033685a0fcc2a52a4f2f8a31f5dd857922c9c91283d075df?s=42&d=identicon&r=x", "https://i0.wp.com/bglh-marketplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/BGLH-Woman-Prism-white-txt-1200.jpeg?fit=1200%2C780&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/bglh-marketplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/FullSizeRender-52.jpg?resize=602%2C719&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8fc2efb0aad0f07e69c7f306e727dc8a767aa4a4132010abfeee606aa2884ac8?s=96&d=identicon&r=x", "https://i0.wp.com/bglh-marketplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/20251002_135938-scaled.jpg?resize=500%2C500&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/24205d2177b5bfcbb647e8b314bd12242fd0697dc3a7e5920535803e37f79e00?s=42&d=identicon&r=x", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/19eb785e2838057044b945005dd9132f166a632501cc4c4805e484d77fe5b4d3?s=42&d=identicon&r=x", "https://bglh-marketplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/bglh-stacked-logo-b.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/bglh-marketplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/18209124_1000111308638_1086386937047302878_o.jpg?resize=500%2C500&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/49b7923e996b1dc75c2a6366feb5ca480d80527c99ed889e035703b58e9f35a4?s=42&d=identicon&r=x", "https://i0.wp.com/bglh-marketplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/FullSizeRender-61.jpg?resize=587%2C742&ssl=1", "https://bglh-marketplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Campaign-For-Safe-Cosmetics-Logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://bglh-marketplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/hair-dryer-diffuser-clipped-tutorial-for-men-hair-care.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://bglh-marketplace.com/2025/07/3-ways-diffusing-can-cause-heat-damage-on-natural-hair/", "title": "3 Ways Diffusing Can Cause Heat Damage on Natural Hair", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "3 Ways Diffusing Can Cause Heat Damage on Natural Hair - BGLH Marketplace", "description": "Generally when naturals think of heat damage, they think of flat irons and curling irons being the culprits.
