Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.\n\nAt such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.\n\nThe Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/29/08/lynda-carter-wonder-woman.jpg", "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/29/08/lynda-carter-wonder-woman.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/29/08/lynda-carter-wonder-woman.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/wonder-woman-james-cameron-lynda-carter-patty-jenkins-dc-criticism-a7973251.html", "title": "Wonder Woman star Lynda Carter hits out at 'poor soul' James Cameron", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/films/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "'Your thuggish jabs at a brilliant director are ill advised'", "og": {"updated_time": "2017-09-29T08:17:28.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Original Wonder Woman actress hits back at James Cameron", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/news/wonder-woman-james-cameron-lynda-carter-patty-jenkins-dc-criticism-a7973251.html", "type": "article", "description": "'Your thuggish jabs at a brilliant director are ill advised'", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/29/08/lynda-carter-wonder-woman.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/29/08/lynda-carter-wonder-woman.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-29T08:17:28.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-09-29T08:17:28.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Film", "author_name": "Jacob Stolworthy", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 404, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 2, "external_link_count": 5}, "date": "2017-09-29T08:17:28.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176299319"}, "twitter": {"title": "Original Wonder Woman actress hits back at James Cameron", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "'Your thuggish jabs at a brilliant director are ill advised'", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/09/29/08/lynda-carter-wonder-woman.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Wonder Woman\",\"James Cameron\",\"Lynda Carter\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506673048.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
