{"url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/fx-feud-finale", "text": "Even before FX\u2019s Feud premiered, series creator Ryan Murphy teased how the mini-series would end for Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, the beleaguered Hollywood legends played by Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon.\n\n\u201cI have always had a wistful dream that Bette and Joan could have watched this [show] together,\u201d Murphy told Vanity Fair of the star-crossed friends. \u201cI think that my favorite line from What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? is at the end of the film, when Jane tells Blanche, just as she is dying, \u2018You mean all this time, we could have been friends?\u2019 To me, that\u2019s what the whole show is about.\u201d\n\nMurphy was so serious about the sentiment that he used it for the title of his finale: \u201cYou Mean All This Time We Could Have Been Friends?\u201d And, as he hinted he might, Murphy found a way to reimagine a better outcome for his protagonists. Crawford, nearing the end of her days in her high-rise Manhattan apartment, hallucinates a brilliant fantasy sequence in which she walks into her living room to find Jack Warner (Stanley Tucci), Hedda Hopper (Judy Davis), and Davis. Warner and Hopper\u2014the forces who willed the stars\u2019 great rivalry into existence, for good publicity and better copy\u2014part, and Crawford sits alone with Davis.\n\nIt\u2019s tender, cathartic, and tragic to see these two Hollywood titans put their vulnerability and ego aside to connect. The sad irony of the fantasy, though, is that in the loneliness of these women\u2019s final years, they never realized how much they truly had in common. They were strong women who battled the studio system to build long-lasting careers, only to be tossed aside as talk-show punchlines the moment the industry decided their expiration date was up. They focused so intently on their careers that they never had truly satisfying relationships with family or friends, and would go on to become the subjects of vengeful memoirs from their ungrateful daughters. And they would cope with the despair of their dwindling careers\u2014and in turn, their crumbling identities\u2014in the same way: by becoming alcoholic recluses fixated on the past.\n\nIn the finale, Murphy allows for another fantasy for the duo by showing Davis dialing Crawford\u2019s number after hearing that her What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? co-star is sick. But Davis cannot bring herself to speak into the receiver\u2014one final missed opportunity at what could have been a meaningful friendship. In a real-life interview, though, Davis\u2019s daughter, B.D., explained why she thought her mother never thawed her iciness toward Crawford.", "images":
