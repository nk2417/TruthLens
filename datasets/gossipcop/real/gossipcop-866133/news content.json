The Demogorgon of the first chapter makes way for the \"Shadow Monster\" born in Will's \"PTSD-like visions of\" his season one experience. Speaking about the new run of episodes, co-creator Ross Duffer of the Duffer Brothers previously said: \u201cIt\u2019s all connected to this singular threat, which is tied into this shape that Will sees in the sky.\"\n\nIn the final Stranger Things 2 trailer the stakes keep rising, as the survivors of season one face the horrors from their nightmares as they creep into reality. Eleven has no choice but to return.\n\nThe Duffer Brothers revealed that the forthcoming season acts as a \"movie sequel\" to the first instalment with the marketing campaign branding the new episodes as Stranger Things 2, as opposed to Stranger Things season 2.\n\nThe official names for the first six episodes were recently confirmed, while the final three remain under wraps. Fans are promised a satisfying Halloween-themed episode in \"Trick or Treat Freak\", sure to feature Mike et al. in the Ghostbusters costumes we've been teased with.\n\nMillie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Winona Ryder and David Harbour return to reprise their roles in Stranger Things 2, joined by new addition Sean Astin.\n\nStranger Things 2 arrives on Netflix on 27 October.", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/13/17/stranger-things-season-2.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/13/17/stranger-things-season-2.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/stranger-things-eleven-final-season-2-trailer-release-date-netflix-a7999026.html", "title": "Stranger Things season 2: Eleven is back in final trailer", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/films/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "The mystery continues in Hawkins from 27 October", "og": {"updated_time": "2017-10-13T16:08:13.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "One huge character returns in the final Stranger Things season 2 trailer", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/news/stranger-things-eleven-final-season-2-trailer-release-date-netflix-a7999026.html", "type": "article", "description": "The mystery continues in Hawkins from 27 October", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/13/17/stranger-things-season-2.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/13/17/stranger-things-season-2.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-13T16:08:13.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-13T16:08:13.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Film", "author_name": "Ella Kemp", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 439, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 4, "external_link_count": 2}, "date": "2017-10-13T16:08:13.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "One huge character returns in the final Stranger Things season 2 trailer", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The mystery continues in Hawkins from 27 October", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/13/17/stranger-things-season-2.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Stranger Things\",\"Netflix\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507910893.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
