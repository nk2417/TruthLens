The two wed Monday at the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, which marks Ayako's official exit from the royal world.\n\nPer Japanese royal law, Ayako was forced to renounce her Princess title since her now-husband lacks any royal or aristocratic titles (or family members). Along with her Princess-hood, Ayako also abandons all status and monetary assets associated with being Princess\u2014although CNN reports she was given a $950,000 lump sum for \"living expenses\" upon her marriage to Moriya. Japan's male royals are not required to renounce their titles if they desire to marry a female commoner.\n\nFor the ceremony, Ayako wore a yellow uchiki kimono with floral detail.\n\nJIJI

PRESS/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock\n\nAfter the ceremony, Princess Ayako spoke to reporters alongside her new husband. \"I am awed by how blessed I am,\" she said. \"I will leave the imperial family today, but I will remain unchanged in my support for his majesty and her majesty.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/envelope-simple-regular.91a0134.svg",
