The pair are snapped walking arm-in-arm through New York\u2019s West Village, before Sam, 25, leans in for a kiss with 24-year-old Brandon.\n\nThis is the first we've heard that Sam and 13 Reasons Why's Brandon are a couple, as only the month before, Sam had spoken about being \"insanely single.\"\n\n24th October 2017: 'Stay With Me' singer Sam confirms his relationship with Brandon!\n\nHe was chatting to The Ellen Degeneres Show when host Ellen playfully grilled the star by asking: \"You're not single right now anymore, right?\"\n\nSam replied: \"No, I'm not, which is crazy. \"\n\nHe continued: \"It's weird bringing out an album and not being single. Because when I brought out In the Lonely Hour I was so lonely. But now I'm singing songs about another guy.\n\n\"I'm quite happy, so it's quite weird.\"\n\n\n\n9th November 2017: Sam reveals that he definitely sees children in his future. So we obviously get carried away and assume he means with Brandon...\n\nHe told The Sun: \"I want kids so bad. I just feel it's nature's way of reminding you that it's not about you. It makes you not selfish.\"\n\n21st December 2017: Brandon makes it Instagram official with this great photo. Nice unicorns...\n\n1st January 2018: Brandon says Sam is one of his favourite things from 2017 in this Instagram gallery, and it's all too much for us to deal with.\n\n3rd January 2018: Sam tells V magazine: \"I'm in a relationship right now and for the first time, I think I deserve to be happy.\"\n\nHe adds: \"I'm actually asking myself if I'm going to be writing some happy love songs soon!\"\n\n30th January 2018: Sam and Brandon go to the Grammys together and seem to have the greatest night of their lives.\n\nGetty Images\n\nGetty Images\n\n9th March 2018: Sam finally breaks his silence on THOSE kissing photos.\n\nBACKGRID\n\nSpeaking on Radio 1, he said: \u201cIt was a joke - as a joke we were attacking each other.\n\n\u201cWe were just waiting outside the shop while my sister got cigarettes. I was just joking.\n\n\u201cI was literally licking his eyeballs. It\u2019s horrendous. I\u2019m going to have to do something crazy to top it.'\n\nHe then compared Brandon, 24, to The Little Mermaid\u2019s Ursula, saying: \u201cHe looks like Ursula sucking the voice out of Ariel. It\u2019s so embarrassing.\u201d\n\nlol.\n\n15th April 2018: Sam has been hanging out with Brandon's family. Serious much?!\n\n17th April 2018: Sam and Brandon are on holiday together! Sam posts an adorable photo of the pair of them at Niagara Falls, and now all we want is to be at Niagara Falls too. Wah.\n\n28th June 2018: Sam and Brandon reportedly split up after nine months together. The Sun reported that they just couldn't make it work with their busy schedules.\n\nA source close to Sam said: \"Sam and Brandon had a real whirlwind romance. They really fell for each other.\n\n\n\n\u201cBut they are both so busy with their careers and unfortunately things just haven\u2019t worked out.\n\n\u201cSam is obviously devastated. This is the most significant relationship he has ever had.\n\nSam has now deleted all photos of him and Brandon from his Instagram. And Brandon has deleted nearly all of them except this one:", "images":
