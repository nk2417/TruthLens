I already married a cunt.\u201d\n\nIn Mexico City she told the audience from the stage: \u201cI, too, go through challenging times in my life and right now is one of them.\u201d\n\nIn Australia, where the Rebel Heart tour drew to a close, Madonna, dressed as a clown, dedicated her song \u201cIntervention\u201d to Rocco saying: \u201cThere\u2019s no end to the mistakes I\u2019ve made. Anyway everybody knows the saga of me and my son Rocco. It\u2019s not a fun story to tell or think about. I probably could have enjoyed myself a little bit more on this tour if he hadn\u2019t disappeared so suddenly and also if I knew when I would see him again.\u201d\n\nAs she sang, images of Rocco appeared on a screen behind her.\n\nThe \u201csaga,\u201d as Madonna refers to it, began late last year when Rocco refused to come back to New York after a trip to visit his dad, according to multiple reports. Rocco had had enough of Madonna\u2019s \u201csoccer mom\u201d parenting style, and the final straw came when she confiscated his phone when he didn\u2019t do his homework, according to a report in The Sun.\n\nThe row continued to simmer until Christmas 2015, when Madonna obtained a court order from a New York court telling Rocco to return to the city in time to start the new term at his New York high school, the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais, where he was enrolled.\n\nHowever, Rocco ignored the ruling and stayed in London, telling a friend on Instagram, \u201cI\u2019m staying here, bro.\u201d\n\nMadonna has long been known as a strict parent. Speaking more than a decade ago about Lourdes getting in trouble for her sloppiness, Madonna told Newsweek: \u201cShe has to earn all of her clothes back by being tidy, picking up things in her room, making her bed in the morning... She wears the same outfit every day to school until she learns her lesson.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Sun, Madonna accused Ritchie of not doing enough to make Rocco obey the court ruling but Ritchie\u2014who is married with three small children\u2014declined to force his son onto a plane, apparently sharing Rocco\u2019s view that Madonna\u2019s parenting style is excessively controlling for a 16-year-old.\n\nRocco himself struck back at his mother through Instagram, by blocking her and posting a picture that described himself as a \u201cson of a bitch.\u201d\n\nIn February, The Sun reported that Madonna was \u201cshocked by evidence that her son is in danger of being drawn into a seedy and dangerous world of soft drugs,\u201d and was running wild in London after they published pictures of the teen smoking what appeared to be a joint at a London skate park.\n\nMadonna was said to be \u201cdisturbed\u201d by the pictures in the piece, but Ritchie (who comes from a fairly bohemian upper class London family himself) regards Rocco\u2019s antics such as drinking a can of lager on the tube with his mates as very little to worry about. It may not be ideal, but nor is it outrageously off-the-rails behavior for a regular London teenager.\n\nAnd while the British tabloids have picked up on the hoodie-wearing mates Rocco was hanging out with at the skate park on the South Bank, he is actually now attending a London day school near his dad\u2019s home in Belsize Park.\n\nAlong with his school mates there are a smattering of celeb kids in Rocco\u2019s circle who can relate to his unique circumstances; Brooklyn Beckham and Gordon Ramsay\u2019s son Jack are close.\n\nAnd on weekends, Rocco voluntarily decamps to his dad\u2019s country manor in Wiltshire with his step-mom, Jacqui Ainsley, and their three small kids.\n\nIn May, during school holidays, Rocco spent time in New York with Madonna, but he was soon back in London with his dad again.\n\nRocco will be relieved that the custody battle, which lawyers had said was putting him under severe stress, is over.", "images": ["https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/fb.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/email-icon.svg?d=342", "https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/1741381130319.png", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/images/obsessed-header-logo-h-2.png?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/AU37OZYATNECPJJOTM65FJT3LQ.png?smart=true&auth=c921d820cc8119838347e4bb81883b36692ed42e6469e37bdb9bdae8df9f629f&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/NHKXP4MZAVE23CPMPZRGAKWUS4.jpg?smart=true&auth=197ab6390b5883b95c9ebad436bcf0add7ea8c8d89109c63bc6c120ce7e5fc67&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/A63MWLYCCFHBPHOWMDSMB2AC34.jpg?smart=true&auth=e6e0d7b78502b822266b1e2ab946831e823f84ee61b3369b9a9446f43ee046eb&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/FFIVNTGEFJMLRKUQVLUWUO72VA.jpg?smart=true&auth=7faaa533c4358f4f252b1fe0111faf1a437d96cf616f4e8e65a275101b93f241&width=1200&height=630", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/google_play.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/twitter-icon.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/FFIVNTGEFJMLRKUQVLUWUO72VA.jpg?smart=true&auth=7faaa533c4358f4f252b1fe0111faf1a437d96cf616f4e8e65a275101b93f241&width=1600&height=900", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/reddit.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/O6EN7N6VTVPH7LY4BPFLYENKXM.jpg?auth=f78162c47e1470eb7d12e3eb5c9376ba99ab80adbccc0fd3a9da05c4e0f85922&width=800&height=1171", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/DPXPPUYZ6JHF7DSLHPW34F25PI.jpg?smart=true&auth=5b1083923ea9a1017cc738ca599056b16bb8f485435e3b7ae3fbbc7936ba2181&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/TVEQLZCSIJHF5MHTBSX5743D5I.png?smart=true&auth=8ec6be7b16209630ff84f12fdb29fa234015ab297bbce0cad3678062d1edd565&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/app_store.svg?d=342", "https://author-service-images-prod-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/6c959014-b2c7-4428-a5ce-8039ab8b6701.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/FFIVNTGEFJMLRKUQVLUWUO72VA.jpg?smart=true&auth=7faaa533c4358f4f252b1fe0111faf1a437d96cf616f4e8e65a275101b93f241&width=1200&height=630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tom Sykes", "European Editor At Large", "Tom.Sykes Thedailybeast.Com", "Got A Tip", "Send It To The Daily Beast", "Catherine Bouris", "Leigh Kimmins", "Harry Thompson", "Sarah Ewall-Wice", "Laura Esposito"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-madonna-lost-the-bitter-custody-battle-over-son-rocco/", "title": "How Madonna Lost the Bitter Custody Battle Over Son Rocco", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Madonna has been forced to accede to her son Rocco\u2019s wish to remain in London with his father, Guy Ritchie.
