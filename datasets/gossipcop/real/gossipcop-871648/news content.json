There will be 15 half-hour episodes total, and each will correspond with one of the houses featured on Fixer Upper season five.\n\nJoanna Gaines/Instagram\n\nOff screen, the couple has big plans for expanding their vast home improvement empire. Joanna\u2019s cookbook, Magnolia Table, (which bares the same name as their new restaurant), comes out April 24th, and she\u2019s also revealing more details about her next tome, a decorating guide that doesn\u2019t have a release date yet.\n\n\u201cI am working on finishing up my design book this month!\u201d Joanna, 39, writes in a post on her blog. \u201cMy passion is to help people in their own homes \u2014 you don\u2019t have to be a designer to get it right.\u201d\n\nShe explains of the highly-anticipated release, \u201cIt\u2019s not about rules and special formulas. I believe it starts by simply going with your gut and telling your story.\u201d She adds, \u201cI unpack many different looks and styles in this book and give a deeper look into the design process and where to start with your space.\u201d\n\nWATCH THIS: PEOPLE Exclusive! Chip & Joanna Gaines Reveal the Real Story Behind Their Decision to End \u2018Fixer Upper\u2019\n\nAnother project the couple is pouring themselves into at the moment is the company that got their renovation business in motion to begin with.\n\n\u201cOur company Magnolia Design and Construction has been fixing up homes for over 15 years now, and we don\u2019t plan on stopping any time soon!\u201d Joanna shares. \u201cWe have some big projects in the works and we are currently renovating a few flip houses and building about 20 new homes here in town.\u201d Chip and Jo previously developed an entire neighborhood, containing 38 new construction homes, all sold.\n\nOn the product front, they will continue to refresh their Target collection, but Joanna also reveals she plans to launch a Magnolia Kids line which, \u201cwill have everything from children\u2019s furniture to accessories.\u201d\n\nTheir biggest adventure in this next \u201cseason of life,\u201d however, will be welcoming their fifth child, a boy, who will join siblings Drake, 12, Ella, 11, Duke, 9, and Emmie Kay, 7.\n\n\u201cThey love my growing belly (and boy is it growing), and they cannot wait to meet him,\u201d the mom of four writes. \u201cI truly believe this baby is a gift from God for our family.\u201d\n\nWith so many ways to stay in touch with the Gaineses, fans will hopefully heal their Fixer Upper fans\u2019 hearts soon. Plus, the couple have hinted that this might not be the last we\u2019ll see of them on screen.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t inconceivable,\u201d Joanna told PEOPLE in October when asked about the possibility of making a return to TV in the future. \u201cWe\u2019re entrepreneurs at heart, so we\u2019ll always be looking forward to what\u2019s next. As it relates to TV, you just never know.\u201d", "images":
