As expected, the finale featured a couple of familiar faces, resolved the B613 case and left some things open for interpretation.\n\nUltimately, Attorney General David Rosen (Josh Malina) \u2014 aka the most innocent person in D.C. whose hat was the whitest among everyone on the show \u2014 would pay the price for everything and was killed off. In the end, it was Cyrus (Jeff Perry) \u2014 the vice president of the United States \u2014 who killed David as he proved yet again that he would do anything to make the Oval Office his own in a storyline that Scandal has followed since its start. The series has always explored how the Oval Office and lust for power corrupts those who come near it, and Cyrus killing David illustrated how far he would go to get the highest office in the country. As for Cyrus, Olivia demands his resignation and he willingly agrees as he acknowledges that the things that he has done in his lust for power are demons from which he can never escape.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always been my contention that the Oval Office, in our show, was a place that corrupted anybody who came near it and the closer you came, the more corrupt it made you and the more damaged it made you,\u201d Rhimes told reporters, including THR, ahead of the finale. \u201cOlivia started out as the character that we knew who has very much believed in how important this particular kind of power was and how molding it and being a part of it was \u2014 and we watched her, like everybody else, become absolutely corrupted by it, and make all the same mistakes that everybody else makes to get what she wants from it.\u201d\n\nThat reveal capped a final season that focused largely on how Olivia (Kerry Washington), who assumed control of B613 in the season six finale, had to fight her way back into the light and stand in the sun of what\u2019s right and, most importantly, who she really is at her core. Given the chance to flee by her father Rowan (Joe Morton), the one-time head of B613, Olivia opted instead to tell the truth and find her moral center again. Rowan, as it turns out, shockingly opted to do the same and testified that he created B613 and did so in a response to a need: because of white men whose privilege left the Republic in a state of neglect. Rowan confesses to his work fixing elections, acts of terrorism and more \u2014 but he did so for a reason. \u201cI am responsible for the fact that this nation still stands,\u201d he testifies. \u201cI wake up every morning and I make America great.\u201d Rowan\u2019s final monologue is a larger statement about race in America and that the white men who run the country were ultimately controlled by a black man. Rowan\u2019s testimony brings Jake (Scott Foley) down as he takes the fall for B613.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that Olivia says in the penultimate episode is this idea of standing up and being somebody who puts everything out in the open is important,\u201d Rhimes told reporters, including THR, ahead of the series ender. \u201cWhether or not everybody pays for what they\u2019ve done, I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s what the finale is about as much as it\u2019s about seeing what happens once that choice has been made.\u201d\n\nRhimes reiterated that she has always been more \u201cTeam Olivia\u201d than any other romantic pairing for her D.C. fixer and the finale would serve to complete Olivia\u2019s \u201cevolution\u201d from the time viewers met her \u2014 when she\u2019d already rigged a presidential election \u2014 to what happens after she finds her moral center again this season.\u201d So post-B613, did Olivia wind up with her fairy tale ending with Fitz and a lifetime of making jam in Vermont? The end of the series featured Olivia\u2019s portrait in the National Portrait Gallery \u2014 leaving viewers to decide for themselves if Olivia would wind up becoming president or was rewarded for her role in cleaning up D.C.\u2019s corruption and becoming the ultimate fixer. (A nice touch: Rhimes\u2018 daughter, Harper, was the young girl left looking up at the portrait, which said \u201cWe the People\u201d along its side.)\n\nAs Rhimes warned, the finale also left that and a few other storylines open for viewers to interpret on their own as Scandal jumped forward following the conclusion of the B613 trial. Rhimes and producers have no immediate plans of discussing how the series ultimately ended and intentionally wanted to leave the audience to determine the show\u2019s ultimate takeaway about politics in D.C. (Rhimes noted that the finale was more about completing Olivia\u2019s journey than making a statement about backroom dealings in D.C.)\n\nThe finale also left viewers to decide if Olivia and Fitz (Tony Goldwyn) got their happy ending and life of jam-making in Vermont.\n\nThat said, here\u2019s a look at where everyone wound up.\n\n\u2022 Olivia (Washington): Cleaned up D.C., stood in the sun and was happily her own person. The ending also implied that the path was clear for a romantic relationship with Fitz, free of B613 and secrets. Rhimes\u2018 ending also reiterated a theme that she has explored in the past: that women do not need a man to be happy, though her romantic path to Fitz remained open. Free from working in Washington, Olivia is left to do whatever she wants as she turns her back on D.C.\n\n\u2022 Fitz (Goldwyn): The former president still has his foundation and likely now has an open path to a romantic future with the love of his life: Olivia. What\u2019s more: his legacy is left untarnished. He becomes Marcus\u2019 first backer in what could be his eventual run for office.\n\n\u2022 Mellie (Young): Cleared from all wrong-doing, Mellie remained president \u2014 with a romantic relationship with Marcus. What\u2019s more, she made gun control central to her platform. Olivia winds up telling Mellie that she has always been able to stand on her own two feet and leaves her to run the country \u2014 without her.\n\n\u2022 Cyrus (Jeff Perry): Resigns as vice president of the United States and confesses that he can\u2019t ever escape from the sins he has committed in his thirst for power.\n\n\u2022 Abby (Darby Stanchfield): Lost the love of her life in David Rosen. Abby\u2019s ending was the most open-ended, though it\u2019s likely she wound up remaining at work for Quinn Perkins and Associates.\n\n\u2022 Quinn (Katie Lowes): Got her happy ending: Married Charlie and is happy with their child \u2014 and running Quinn Perkins and Associates.\n\n\u2022 Huck (Guillermo Diaz): Remains by Abby\u2019s side as she grieves for David.\n\n\u2022 Jake (Scott Foley): Takes the fall for B613 and spends the rest of his life in jail. Olivia apologizes to him for making him step out of the sun. Jake admits that he got something out of the whole thing \u2014 he loved Olivia. Jake becomes the only person who pays for everyone\u2019s sins, letting all the Gladiators off the hook for everything that they\u2019ve done.\n\n\u2022 Rowan (Joe Morton): His testimony helps set all the Gladiators free \u2014 and bring down Jake and all of B613.\n\n\u2022 David (Josh Malina): Pays the price for Cyrus\u2019 lust for power and is killed by the vice president.\n\n\u2022 Charlie (George Newbern): Is released from jail and works for his wife at Quinn Perkins and Associates.\n\n\u2022 Marcus (Cornelius Smith Jr.): The latest Gladiator likely winds up in the White House \u2014 as the first husband to president Mellie Grant. What\u2019s more, he\u2019s going to explore his own political future, with Fitz backing him.\n\nScandal, which helped cement Rhimes as a mega-producer and brand of her own, marked the close of prolific showrunner\u2019s chapter on broadcast as every series she creates going forward will be for Netflix, where she signed a nine-figure overall deal.\n\nIn terms of Scandal\u2018s future, Rhimes \u2014 who once seriously considered doing a B613 spinoff \u2014 confirmed that the end of the series is indeed the end of the franchise and there are no offshoots planned: \u201cScandal is done.\u201d While it would be easy to revisit the world of corruption and Gladiators on ABC\u2019s Rhimes-produced drama How to Get Away With Murder after both series crossed over earlier this season, there are no current plans for that, either, though she stressed that the decision ultimately lies with showrunner Pete Nowalk.\n\nWhat did you think of the Scandal series finale?
