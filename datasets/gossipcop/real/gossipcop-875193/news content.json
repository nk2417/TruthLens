News.\n\nAccording to TMZ, which first reported the news, either Jon or Kate took one of their 13-year-old daughters to the orthodontist and the argument erupted over who would be taking her home.\n\n\u201cThe call came in at 1:10 this afternoon for a verbal domestic argument \u2026 over the custody of one of their 13-year-old daughters,\u201d a Wyomissing Police Department spokesperson told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cNo one was arrested and the daughter did go home with the father after she expressed that was her desire to do.\u201d\n\nThe former Jon & Kate Plus 8 stars welcomed eight children over the course of their 10-year marriage: twins Mady and Cara, both 16, and sextuplets Aaden, Alexis, Collin, Hannah, Leah and Joel, each 13. They finalized their divorce in 2009.\n\nWATCH: Story Behind the Story: A Lesson Kate Gosselin Had to Learn the Hard Way\n\nThis past May, the former couple\u2019s sextuplets turned 13, and Kate shared a heartfelt Instagram post to celebrate the milestone.\n\n\u201cHAPPY 13th BIRTHDAY, my precious Alexis, Hannah, Aaden, Collin, Leah and Joel! At this moment (7:51-7:53 am) 13 years ago, my life and heart were completed with your births!\u201d the Kate Plus 8 star began.\n\n\u201cI love you all and NO MATTER WHAT it requires of me, I will ALWAYS be there for you; I\u2019ll always be your biggest cheerleader, your role model by example, your shoulder to cry on, the hug and laugh you need, and your mommy and friend! I love you guys!\u201d she continued.\n\nAlthough her children are all growing up and have each entered their teenage years, Kate admitted in a recent Kate Plus 8 TLC promo that she still worries about their pasts, presents and futures.\n\n\u201cBeing in a family of eight kids and a single mom, worrying about their present, their future, how to feed them, their college, how they turn out, all of it \u2014 you never stop worrying,\u201d she said.", "images":
