The couple has had limited contact with their biological daughter since then, but it\u2019s clear the message from the 8-year-old meant a lot to Baltierra.\n\n\u201cMost precious thing ever!!\u201d she captioned the photo with a crying emoji and two hearts.\n\nOn this season of Teen Mom OG, Baltierra and Tyler have had trouble reconciling their desire to see their firstborn daughter and their relationship with her adoptive parents.\n\n\u201cI try not to make it difficult. Things always seem like they\u2019re difficult and I\u2019m not trying to make it difficult. I\u2019m willing and trying and offering. And then I get ignored for months and I try. And then she finally answers me,\u201d Baltierra said of her daughter\u2019s adoptive mother in a recent episode.\n\n\u201cI feel like I get punished because my kid asks questions about me, or she wants to know where she comes from,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhat [did they] think adoption is? She\u2019s going to do that.\u201d\n\nBaltierra has been open about her problems with anxiety and depression in the past, entering treatment after the birth of Novalee for postpartum depression.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing very well. Two years out, you know, since birth, so I\u2019m doing \u2014 I actually feel really good, I do. I had a panic attack this morning, but I worked through it. It\u2019s just knowing the things that you have to do to work through it. But yeah, I\u2019m doing way better,\u201d she said in April.\n\nPhoto credit: MTV", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/billy-ray-cyrus-elizabeth-hurley-2.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/fire-country-season-4-key-art-cbs.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/08/32a08016-72b7-41f8-b593-df0f660db84e.png?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Rumer", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/news/catelynn-lowell-christmas-gift-daughter-carly/", "title": "Catelynn Lowell Receives Christmas Gift From First Child After Leaving Treatment", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Catelynn Lowell Receives Christmas Gift From First Child After Leaving Treatment", "description": "Catelynn Lowell Baltierra might not have been able to be with her firstborn daughter, Carly, this Christmas, but she was surely in the 8-year-old\u2019s heart.
