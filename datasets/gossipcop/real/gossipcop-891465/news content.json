The average comic on the show likely earns no more than $500,000 for a 21-episode season, Forbes reported in August.\n\nAlec Baldwin only makes $1,400 per episode for his recurring impression of Donald Trump on \u201cSNL.\u201d\n\nBut Baldwin keeps coming back. He\u2019s parodied the soon-to-be commander-in-chief in eight of the first 10 episodes on the late-night sketch comedy show\u2019s 42nd season, often churning out the most memorable segment of the week.\n\nAnd while Baldwin doesn\u2019t write any of his own jokes for his spoofs of Trump, he knows how to put his personal twist on the mockery.\n\n\u201cI see a guy who seems to pause and dig for the more precise and better language he wants to use, and never finds it,\u201d he told The Times of his Trump impression. \u201cIt\u2019s the same dish \u2014 it\u2019s a grilled-cheese sandwich rhetorically over and over again.\u201d\n\nTrump, meanwhile, doesn\u2019t see the humor in the 58-year-old star\u2019s impression. The President-elect rushed to Twitter to lambaste \u201cSNL,\u201d as well as Baldwin\u2019s parody, multiple times in recent months \u2014 then doubled-down in a recent \u201cToday\u201d show interview.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing funny about it,\u201d he told host Matt Lauer. \u201cThe skits are terrible. I mean, I like Alec, but his imitation of me is really mean-spirited and not very good.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think his imitation of me gets me at all,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cAnd it\u2019s meant to be very mean-spirited, which is very biased. I don\u2019t like it. So I can tweet that out.\u201d\n\nDonald Trump has made it clear he\u2019s not a fan of Baldwin\u2019s impression.\n\nBaldwin has fired back at Trump multiple times after the billionaire\u2019s criticisms of the show, recently tweeting, \u201cRelease your tax returns and I\u2019ll stop.\u201d\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the president of the United States takes home $400,000 per year.", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2016/12/21/ABCQWBY4OBCCIIRIEBMLMQUFAE.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2016/12/21/ABCQWBY4OBCCIIRIEBMLMQUFAE.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Sblendorio"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2016/12/21/guess-how-much-alec-baldwin-makes-per-episode-for-his-donald-trump-impression-on-saturday-night-live/", "title": "Guess how much Alec Baldwin makes per episode for his Donald Trump impression on \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Peter Sblendorio", "canonical": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2016/12/21/guess-how-much-alec-baldwin-makes-per-episode-for-his-donald-trump-impression-on-saturday-night-live/"}, "description": "Well, they do always say the president is underpaid.", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Guess how much Alec Baldwin makes per episode for his Donald Trump impression on \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2016/12/21/guess-how-much-alec-baldwin-makes-per-episode-for-his-donald-trump-impression-on-saturday-night-live/", "description": "Well, they do always say the president is underpaid.
