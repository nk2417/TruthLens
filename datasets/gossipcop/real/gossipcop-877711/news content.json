A statement released by Kensington Palace on Twitter reads, \"Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to announce that the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting their third child. The Queen and members of both families are delighted with the news.\" Kate's morning sickness was also mentioned in the statement, as an explanation for her absence at upcoming events: \"As with her previous two pregnancies, the Duchess is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum. Her Royal Highness will no longer carry out her planned engagement at the Hornsey Road Children's Centre in London today. The Duchess is being cared for at Kensington Palace.\"", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/690baa6d7eff1f4558e5e9e8/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6910d1f2d486cb4be30d2542/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68fd0927faadfd12d873d807/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59aea89403a6ad32535a8636/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-611852444.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68d8252693dced9f4dc9df51/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691346d59a4ea3b29e90544b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_640%2Cq_80%2Cw_640/v1503077583/glamour_newlyweds-recreate-their-parents-wedding-photos.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/688fc705711fa5299d576da4/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690cc1655625e2a9de14e258/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/69010e90a18581c0faf5cbcc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/glamour-banner-v2.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/logo-oneNav.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59aea89403a6ad32535a8636/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-611852444.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691661ad87f42456a221e092/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6913ad6972a856e01633db66/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691388f0185ff327272e0075/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59aea89403a6ad32535a8636/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-611852444.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrea Park"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/prince-william-first-comments-princess-kate-third-pregnancy", "title": "Prince William Says Princess Kate's Pregnancy With Their Third Child Is 'Very Good News'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Andrea Park", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "At a mental health conference on Tuesday, Prince William said he and Kate are \"celebrating\" now, after her third pregnancy was \"a bit anxious to start with.\"", "id": "59aea662497b9d6ef5941480", "keywords": "prince william,princess kate,kate middleton", "news_keywords": "prince william,princess kate,kate middleton", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59aea662497b9d6ef5941480", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"At a mental health conference on Tuesday, Prince William said he and Kate are \\\"celebrating\\\" now, after her third pregnancy was \\\"a bit anxious to start with.\\\"\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59aea89403a6ad32535a8636/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-611852444.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59aea89403a6ad32535a8636/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-611852444.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "But now they're starting to celebrate the happy news.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59aea89403a6ad32535a8636/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-611852444.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Prince William Says Things Were 'a Bit Anxious' at the Start of Kate's Third Pregnancy", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/prince-william-first-comments-princess-kate-third-pregnancy"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-09-05T14:34:04.396Z", "modified_time": "2017-09-05T14:34:04.396Z", "author": "Andrea Park"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "But now they're starting to celebrate the happy news.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59aea89403a6ad32535a8636/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-611852444.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Prince William Says Things Were 'a Bit Anxious' at the Start of Kate's Third Pregnancy"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59aea89403a6ad32535a8636/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/GettyImages-611852444.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504622044.396, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
