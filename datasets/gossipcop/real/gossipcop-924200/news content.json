While a lot of the lyrics can\u2019t be reprinted in a family publication, a gentle version of the song\u2019s theme is in the chorus: \u201cBe careful with me, do you know what you\u2019re doing? Whose feelings that you\u2019re hurting and bruising? You gonna gain the whole world, but is it worth the girl that you\u2019re losing?\u201d she sings on the chorus. \u201cYeah, it\u2019s not a threat, it\u2019s a warning.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a cute reference to TLC\u2019s 1994 infidelity-themed hit \u201cCreep\u201d in the opening lyrics that set the song\u2019s tone: \u201cI gave you TLC, you wanna creep and s\u2013t?/ I poured out my whole heart to a piece of s\u2013t.\u201d\n\nCardi\u2019s debut studio album, \u201cInvasion of Privacy,\u201d is due on April 6, with an appearance on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d the following night and her Coachella debut the following two weekends. While information about the album has been kept under wraps for months despite a constant barrage of questions \u2014 and she\u2019s been teasing a number of songs on her Instagram account without revealing titles \u2014 it\u2019s safe to assume that the new single will be on it, as well as the rapper\u2019s breakout hit \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d and its follow-up, \u201cBartier Cardi.\u201d She has released two mixtapes to date, \u201cGangsta Bitch Music\u201d Volume 1 in 2916 and Volume 2 in 2017, and has made a host of guest appearances on songs and on television, most recently Migos\u2019 \u201cMotorSport\u201d and Bruno Mars\u2019 \u201cFinesse,\u201d which she performed with him on the Grammy Awards earlier this year.\n\nEarlier this week, Variety broke the news that Cardi has new management in Quality Control\u2019s Kevin \u201cCoach K\u201d Lee and Pierre \u201cPee\u201d Thomas. She joins Migos and Lil Yachty on the QC roster of star acts. The Atlanta-based management company and record label has seen stratospheric success in recent years modeling its business after such game-changing entities as Cash Money and No Limit.\n\nWarning: Explicit language", "images": ["https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115820363.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/kevin-spacey-homeless.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115731102.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6&comscorekw=entertainment", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115838397.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115485559.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115848671.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fbethenny-frankels-gift-picks-include-115619188.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/917121146.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/paige2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115852692.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115852085.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115669041.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115742458.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/917121146.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/kelly-97.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/917121146.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "http://variety.com/2018/music/news/cardi-b-drops-a-warning-to-cheating-fiance-in-new-single-be-careful-listen-1202740213/", "title": "Cardi B warns cheating fianc\u00e9 in new single", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
