When the singer hit the American Music Awards red carpet on Sunday with her pal and stylist, Brad Goreski, by her side, she was greeted by Ramona \u2014 well, sort of.\n\nHow to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of New York City on Bravo and Peacock.\n\nYou see Lea stopped to chat with E! News and it was then that they presented her with a video message filmed especially for her by The Real Housewives of New York City pal. The gift was enough to freak Lea out in the best way possible. But, you see, Ramona did want something in return \u2014 to have Lea sing \"Happy Birthday\" to her since she had just celebrated two days earlier. But that wasn't all. She also suggested that Lea hang with her and her Big Apple crew and perhaps make a cameo on RHONY at some point.\n\nIt was an offer that left Lea \"shaking\" all over. We mean, can you blame her?\n\nCheck out the post on Instagram\n\nUntil then, Lea might have to settle on weighing in on Housewives drama instead of participating in it. Check out what we mean, below.", "images":
