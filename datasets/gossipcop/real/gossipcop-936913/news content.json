So can you blame us for wondering which of the bride's cast mates would be invited to her big day?\n\nWell, we can now reveal that the show's most lauded and best loved stars have turned up at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle to celebrate their former colleague's wedding today, and we for one are overjoyed.\n\nRex\n\nArriving en mass at the Windsor location, the Suits cast truly brought a dash of Hollywood to the proceedings with some of the most fabulous outfits of all the wedding guests.\n\n\n\nRead Next\n\nGetty Images\n\nGina Torres looked statuesque in a floral dress and cream hat, whilst Sarah Rafferty worked a stunning navy dress with oversized puffball sleeves. But our style award goes to Abigail Spencer who sported a retro-style blue polka dot dress with classic red lipstick and a seriously chic Priyanka Chopra wearing lavender by her side.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMarkle's co-star and on-screen husband Patrick J Adams arrived looking seriously sharp in a black Canali suit with dark red tie, arm in arm with his wife IRL Troian Bellisario.\n\nRex\n\nTheir attendance at the wedding comes days after the stars have teased fans with updates on their stay in London this week.\n\n\n\nFollowing the couple's engagement, it was widely rumoured Markle's co-star/BFF Sarah Rafferty might be in the running to be Meghan's bridesmaids given their close-knit relationship over the years.\n\nSarah Rafferty // Getty Images\n\nIn the hours that followed, Rafferty and her co-stars took to social media to congratulate Markle and the prince on their up-coming wedding.\n\nIn last month's two hour final Suits special episode, Markle's Rachel Zane and fianc\u00e9 Mike Ross (played by Patrick J. Adams, who has also left the series), finally tied the knot.\n\n\n\nMarkle - who has been one of the original cast members of the show since it began in 2011 - made a truly beautiful bride during her wedding to her on-screen husband, Ross, which served as the perfect practice for her real-life wedding today.\n\nIn the words of Suits character Lewis Litt, the stars' attendance at today's wedding was truly 'littastic'.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-113268071-1618484059.jpg?crop=0.750xw:1.00xh;0.127xw,0&resize=360:*",
