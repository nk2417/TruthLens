Her original plan was to become a marine biologist, but after modelling through high school she was bitten by \u201cthe acting bug.\u201d\n\nSmulders was just 22 when she landed the role as Canadian-born reporter Robin Scherbatsky on \u201cHow I Met Your Mother.\u201d The CBS comedy enjoyed a nine-season run that ended in 2014.\n\nHer new role, as Lisa on \u201cFriends From College,\u201d calls on the 35-year-old actress to be the junior member of a group of Harvard chums. Holding onto friendships while heading into their 40s \u2014 despite one or two serious obstacles \u2014 is the premise of this edgy new comedy.\n\nThe first episode finds Lisa and her husband Ethan (Keegan-Michael Key) moving to New York and reuniting with the rest of the gang. Trouble is, Ethan has been carrying on a long distance affair \u2014 since college \u2014 with successful designer Sam (Annie Parisse). Sam\u2019s actress friend Marianne (Jae Suh Park) is tired of keeping the adulterous couple\u2019s secret. Meanwhile, literary agent Max (Fred Savage) has to give his buddy Ethan the bad news about his latest book. Nick (Nat Faxon) is the gang\u2019s slacker pal.\n\nSam\u2019s businessman husband (guest star Greg Germann) is detached enough to see this group in all their petty, competitive glory.\n\nExecutive producer and writer Stoller directed all eight first-season episodes. Smulders says the London native was the main reason she signed on for the series.\n\n\u201cI just really love his work. I\u2019m a fan,\u201d says Smulders, who attended a table read for Stoller\u2019s 2008 feature hit \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall.\u201d His other work includes writing and directing \u201cGet Him to the Greek\u201d as well as writing the most recent Muppet features plus \u201cCaptain Underpants: The First Epic Movie.\u201d\n\nShooting the series in New York also suited Smulders, who lives there with husband and former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d player Taran Killam and their two young children. Then there was the script: \u201cThe characters were interesting and the writing was really good. It was a no brainer, really.\u201d\n\nThe series draws from Stoller\u2019s own experience as a Harvard grad. He met his wife Francesca Delbanco \u2014 co-creator on the series \u2014 at a playwriting workshop while attending the Ivy League institution.\n\nStoller says he\u2019s never felt the need to attend a Harvard reunion because he sees his core friends all the time. They\u2019re a fairly co-ed group, he adds, \u201cwhich basically means everyone dated one another at one point.\u201d\n\nWhat Stoller observed is that while his old friends all seem to \u201creally love each other and care for each other, they might be kind of destructive to be around. My wife and I have weird, regressive relationships with all of our friends from college.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Bill Brioux is a freelance TV columnist based in Brampton, Ont.
