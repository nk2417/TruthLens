The two were celebrating the rapper's 48th birthday.\n\nBeyonce went '90s chic with her crimped curls, purple lipstick and a green-and-black checkered dress that had a hint of floral embellishments at the slit. She paired the style with a blue fur coat, a mesh top with the word \"unity\" on the sleeve, a burgundy velvet purse, Krewe cat-eye sunglasses and black strappy shoes.\n\nAs for JAY-Z, he wore a maroon suit that he paired with a white T-shirt and matching sneakers, along with several big gold chains.\n\nSplash News\n\nThe photo op comes years after the \"99 Problems\" rapper and Solange Knowles made headlines when surveillance footage from a hotel elevator was leaked, which showed Beyonce's younger sister lunging at her brother-in-law just moments after they attended the 2014 Met Gala in New York City.\n\nThe couple kept mum about the incident for several years until JAY-Z spoke with Rap Radar hosts Elliott Wilson and Brian \u201cB.Dot\u201d Miller in August about the infamous footage.\n\n\"We had one disagreement ever -- before and after we\u2019ve been cool,\" JAY-Z shared. \"She\u2019s like my sister. I will protect her. That\u2019s my sister, not my sister-in-law. My sister. Period.\"\n\n\u201cI fought my brothers and argued with my brothers my whole life,\" he added. \"It just so happens, who we are, these things go into a different space -- but it ain\u2019t nothing.\"\n\nMore recently, JAY-Z gave a candid interview with The New York Times, where he admitted to being unfaithful to Beyonce in the past and shared that they had originally planned for Lemonade and 4:44 to be a joint album.\n\n\"We were using our art almost like a therapy session. And we started making music together. And then the music she was making at that time was further along,\" he explained. \"So, her album came out as opposed to the joint album that we were working on. We still have a lot of that music. And this is what it became. There was never a point where it was like, 'I\u2019m making this album.' I was right there the entire time.\"\n\nCheck out more of JAY-Z's interview with the Times:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-10/jay_z_gettyimages-161422885.jpg?h=f0e678b6&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2014-05/640_solange_jayz_140512_488408517.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/bey_jay_spl1632964_001.jpg?h=b7240f27", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2017-02/1280_beyonce_getty_634996532.jpg?width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/bey_jay_spl1632964_001.jpg?h=b7240f27&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2014-05/640_solange_knowles_jay_z_standard_hotel.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/bey_jay_spl1632964_001.jpg?h=b7240f27", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/beyonce-stylishly-celebrates-jay-zs-birthday-following-his-infidelity-admission-92141", "title": "Beyonce Stylishly Celebrates JAY-Z\u2019s Birthday Following His Infidelity Admission", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/bey_jay_spl1632964_001.jpg?h=b7240f27", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The power couple posed in an elevator three years after the scuffle between the rapper and Beyonce's sister, Solange Knowles.", "title": "Beyonce Stylishly Celebrates JAY-Z\u2019s Birthday Following His Infidelity Admission", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/beyonce-stylishly-celebrates-jay-zs-birthday-following-his-infidelity-admission-92141", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The power couple posed in an elevator three years after the scuffle between the rapper and Beyonce's sister, Solange Knowles.", "twitter": {"description": "The power couple posed in an elevator three years after the scuffle between the rapper and Beyonce's sister, Solange Knowles.", "title": "Beyonce Stylishly Celebrates JAY-Z\u2019s Birthday Following His Infidelity Admission", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/beyonce-stylishly-celebrates-jay-zs-birthday-following-his-infidelity-admission-92141", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/bey_jay_spl1632964_001.jpg?h=b7240f27", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Beyonce Stylishly Celebrates JAY-Z\u2019s Birthday Following His Infidelity Admission | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Beyonce, Jay Z, Solange Knowles", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
