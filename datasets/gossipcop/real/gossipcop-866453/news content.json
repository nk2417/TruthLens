Grande also visited injured fans in the hospital prior to the benefit concert.\n\nGrande\u2019s honorary citizenship is part of a larger plan by the city council to update their system in which non-citizens are honored for their contributions to Manchester. The highest civilian honor will remain the \u201cfreedom of the city,\u201d which has only been awarded four times since 2000.", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ariana-grande-manchester-citizen-read-2-2e987b18-37be-4c22-844c-f1fb71ed8a8e.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ariana-grande-manchester-citizen-read-2-2e987b18-37be-4c22-844c-f1fb71ed8a8e.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Kreps", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ariana-grande-to-become-manchesters-first-honorary-citizen-198781/", "title": "Ariana Grande to Become Manchester\u2019s First Honorary Citizen", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Ariana Grande will be the first person named as an honorary citizen of Manchester following the singer's response to the May 22nd terror attack.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Daniel Kreps", "tags": "Ariana Grande, Manchester", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ariana Grande to Become Manchester's First Honorary Citizen", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ariana-grande-to-become-manchesters-first-honorary-citizen-198781/", "description": "Ariana Grande will be the first person named as an honorary citizen of Manchester following the singer's response to the May 22nd terror attack.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ariana-grande-manchester-citizen-read-2-2e987b18-37be-4c22-844c-f1fb71ed8a8e.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "width": 1600, "height": 900, "alt": "Ariana Grande to Become Manchester's First Honorary Citizen"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-14T12:50:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T13:50:47+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ariana Grande will be the first person named as an honorary citizen of Manchester following the singer's response to the May 22nd terror attack.", "site": "@RollingStone", "creator": "@danielkreps", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ariana Grande to Become Manchester\u2019s First Honorary Citizen", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ariana-grande-manchester-citizen-read-2-2e987b18-37be-4c22-844c-f1fb71ed8a8e.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497444635.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
