I came here to Vietnam, so excited to perform, my doctor won\u2019t allow me to do the show for you tonight. I\u2019m so so sorry. There is nothing I hate to do more than to do this but I promise to make it up to you in the future. I love you and thank you for understanding.\u201d\n\nInstagram Stories\n\nGrande is next set to appear in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou Shi, China, through the end of August before traveling to New Zealand and Australia in September.\n\nShe has been on the road with her Dangerous Woman tour for months, only briefly taking a break after the tragic bombing that took place in May following her concert in Manchester, England. The attack killed 22 people.\n\nGrande raised money for the victims and their families shortly thereafter at the \u201cOne Love Manchester\u201d benefit concert. The event made millions, with $324,000 going to each of the victims' families.\n\nFor more from Grande, watch the clip below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-06/1280_ariana_grande_lights_getty_614468090.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2020-06/ariana-grande-gettyimages-1202155126.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/ariana_grande_concert_gettyimages_610267430.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-06/et_a04_manchester_060517_hulu.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/ariana_grande_concert_gettyimages_610267430.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/ariana_grande_concert_gettyimages_610267430.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/ariana-grande-cancels-vietnam-concert-due-to-health-problems-85904", "title": "Ariana Grande Cancels Vietnam Concert Due to 'Health Problems'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/ariana_grande_concert_gettyimages_610267430.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The pop star is set to travel to China later this month.", "title": "Ariana Grande Cancels Vietnam Concert Due to 'Health Problems'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/ariana-grande-cancels-vietnam-concert-due-to-health-problems-85904", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The pop star is set to travel to China later this month.", "twitter": {"description": "The pop star is set to travel to China later this month.", "title": "Ariana Grande Cancels Vietnam Concert Due to 'Health Problems'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/ariana-grande-cancels-vietnam-concert-due-to-health-problems-85904", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/ariana_grande_concert_gettyimages_610267430.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Ariana Grande Cancels Vietnam Concert Due to 'Health Problems'  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, Music, Ariana Grande", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
