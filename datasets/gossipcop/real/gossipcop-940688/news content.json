Below, global superstar and outstanding LGBTQ ally Ariana Grande shares hers. Read more Pride Month love letters here.\n\nExplore Ariana Grande See latest videos, charts and news\n\nThere is nothing more infectious than the joy and love that the LGBTQ community exudes. I grew up with a gay brother whose every move I would emulate. I idolized him. Everything Frankie did, I would do. I can\u2019t remember a difference between Frankie before he came out and Frankie after he came out. He\u2019s always just been Frankie. Sexuality and gender were never topics my family and I were afraid to discuss. When Frankie came out my surprisingly unfazed (for his age) grandfather said \u201cCongrats! Can we go to dinner now? I\u2019m fuckin\u2019 hungry.\u201d\n\nI was taught to do my makeup by queens in gay bars in New York City. I made my Broadway debut at 14 years old and did 8 shows a week but there was never a night I was too tired to run to a gay bar and do a quick Whitney cover before bed.\n\nMy music being embraced and celebrated by the LGBTQ community is all I ever truly cared about when I thought about my career goals early on. There\u2019s no award I could win or accolade I could receive that would fulfill me more than seeing a 6-foot queen with a 4-foot ponytail walk into my meet n greet and say \u201chey girl\u201d or meeting a young queer person at Starbucks and them letting me know that my music has helped them become who they are. Literally nothing.\n\nLove is like music. It knows no boundaries and isn\u2019t exclusive to any one gender, sexuality, race, religion, age or creed. It\u2019s a freedom and a delicious luxury that all people should be able to sink into and enjoy every moment of.\n\nI am eternally indebted to and inspired by the LGBTQ community. I hope to create anthems for you that wrap you up with comfort and make you get your best life for as long as I live. Thank you for celebrating me the way I celebrate you.\n\nI love you forever.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "http://static.billboard.com/files/media/billboard-pride-2017-recirc.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/ariana-grande-pride-love-letters-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/ariana-grande-pride-love-letters-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ariana Grande", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/culture/pride/ariana-grande-love-letter-to-the-lgbtq-community-8458780/", "title": "Ariana Grande: Love Letter to the LGBTQ Community", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "For Gay Pride Month, Billboard asked numerous pop culture luminaries to write 'love letters' to the LGBTQ community.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Ariana Grande", "tags": "bbpride, pride, prideletters18", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ariana Grande: Love Letter to the LGBTQ Community", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/culture/pride/ariana-grande-love-letter-to-the-lgbtq-community-8458780/", "description": "For Gay Pride Month, Billboard asked numerous pop culture luminaries to write 'love letters' to the LGBTQ community.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/ariana-grande-pride-love-letters-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Ariana Grande"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-01T15:03:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-28T20:54:16+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "For Gay Pride Month, Billboard asked numerous pop culture luminaries to write 'love letters' to the LGBTQ community.", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ariana Grande: Love Letter to the LGBTQ Community", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/ariana-grande-pride-love-letters-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527865380.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
