The song itself, as well as its lyric video and music video, have broken Spotify streaming and YouTube watch records.\n\nBusiness Insider reports that Swift's \"Look What You Made Me Do\" music video, which debuted Sunday (Aug. 27) during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, now holds the record for the biggest debut in YouTube's history. The video was viewed 43.2 million times in its first 24 hours on the platform, averaging 30,000 views per minute and an average hourly audience of more than 3 million views during that time.\n\nAdditionally, when Swift dropped \"Look What You Made Me Do\" and its lyric video late Thursday night (Aug. 24), it set another YouTube record and a record on Spotify. On Spotify, the single was streamed just under 8 million times in its first 24 hours -- a new record for first-day listening, per Forbes. The lyric video, meanwhile, according to Billboard, was watched more than 19 million times in its first 24 hours live on YouTube, making it the most-viewed lyric video within 24 hours of its debut.\n\n\u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d is the first single from Swift\u2019s upcoming new album, Reputation; the record is due out on Nov. 10, and Swift will tour in support of the project.\n\nSwift last released a new album, 1989, in 2014; the record became the best-selling album of 2014, and the fastest-selling record in more than 10 years. In June, Swift\u2019s back catalog of music returned to streaming platforms; she originally removed her music from music from such outlets in 2014.\n\nYou Think You Know Taylor Swift?", "images": ["http://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2017/08/taylor-swift-spotify-youtube-records.jpg?w=630&amp;h=420&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89&w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2024/04/attachment-Jelly_roll_Katy_perry.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2024/04/attachment-Morgan-Wallen-Missisippi.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2024/04/attachment-kelsea-ballerini-lawsuit.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2015/04/dolly-parton-saturday-night-live.png?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2015/11/john-denver-birthday1.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2017/10/theboot-logo.png", "https://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2017/08/taylor-swift-spotify-youtube-records.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "http://townsquare.media/site/341/files/2024/04/attachment-15.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2017/04/garth-brooks-debut-album.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2015/04/jo-dee-messina-boston-marathon.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2015/04/alan-jackson-hollywood-walk-of-fame-star.jpg?w=980&q=75"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2017/08/taylor-swift-spotify-youtube-records.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Angela Stefano"], "canonical_link": "https://theboot.com/taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-youtube-spotify-records/", "title": "Taylor Swift's 'Look What You Made Me Do' Breaks Records", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "theboot_dotcom", "description": "Taylor Swift's Look What You Made Me Do has broken records on both the Spotify and YouTube platforms.", "keywords": "taylor swift look what you made me do, taylor swift look what you made me do records, taylor swift look what you made me do youtube record, taylor swift look what you made me do spotify record,country music news", "fb": {"app_id": 301811631592820, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "false", "admins": 59877105906, "pages": 59877105906}, "og": {"title": "Taylor Swift's 'Look What You Made Me Do' Breaks Records", "description": "Taylor Swift's Look What You Made Me Do has broken records on both the Spotify and YouTube platforms.", "url": "https://theboot.com/taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-youtube-spotify-records/", "site_name": "The Boot", "type": "article", "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2017/08/taylor-swift-spotify-youtube-records.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thebootdotcom"}, "sailthru.description": "Taylor Swift's Look What You Made Me Do has broken records on both the Spotify and YouTube platforms.", "sailthru.date": "2017-08-29 14:05:36", "sailthru.title": "Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018Look What You Made Me Do\u2019 Breaks YouTube, Spotify Records", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-theboot, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, taylor-swift, country-news", "sailthru.author": "astefano", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2017/08/taylor-swift-spotify-youtube-records.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/623/files/2017/08/taylor-swift-spotify-youtube-records.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "ad": {"primis": {"id": 113735}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504029936.0, "source": "http://theboot.com", "summary": ""}
