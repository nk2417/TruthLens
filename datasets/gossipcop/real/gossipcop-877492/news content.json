One photo is of Turner embracing the Alaskan Klee Kai in a loving hug, while the other photo shows Waldo sitting alongside the couple's other pooch, Porky Basquiat Jonas.\n\n\"Welcome to the family @waldopicassojonas,\" Turner wrote, tagging Waldo's personal Instagram handle in the caption, because of course their awesome dog has his own Instagram.\n\nVenturing over to Waldo's Instagram page, the inquisitive canine has only one photo so far, and it's of Waldo and Porky sniffing eachother through a window. The photo is adorably captioned, \"Bruthuz\" along with a fist bump emoji.\n\nMeanwhile, the official announcement regarding Waldo's adoption was posted by Porky's personal Instagram, which Turner and Jonas started in September. In a super cute photo of the nearly identical dogs, it was revealed that Waldo is actually Porky's real, biological brother.\n\n\"I\u2019d like to make an announcement. Me, my parents and I have adopted my actual brother from the same litter,\" the photo caption reads. \"Please welcome my little brother @waldopicassojonas.\"\n\nThe adoption of this new pet comes exactly six months after the 28-year-old singer and the 22-year-old actress revealed that they had gotten engaged after nearly a year of dating.\n\nJonas revealed the news with a photo of Turner's hand sporting an impressively large sparkler, alongside the caption \"She said yes.\" Turner shared the same photo, writing, \"I said yes.\"\n\nFor more on the cute couple's heartwarming relationship, check out the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2024-02/Simu_Allison_GettyImages-2016310573_1920.jpg?h=b8626526&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/joe_sophie.jpg?h=e244e6c5&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/joe_sophie.jpg?h=e244e6c5", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-05/1280_joe_jonas_sophie_turner_getty_678093812.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_111217_NickJonas720.png?h=d8a1787a&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-02/sophie_joe_jonas.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/joe_sophie.jpg?h=e244e6c5", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/sophie-turner-and-joe-jonas-adopt-adorable-new-puppy-named-waldo-picasso-100486", "title": "Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas Adopt Adorable New Puppy Named Waldo Picasso", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/joe_sophie.jpg?h=e244e6c5", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The happy couple shared photos of their gorgeous new Alaskan Klee Kai, who is the brother of their other dog, Porky Basquiat.", "title": "Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas Adopt Adorable New Puppy Named Waldo Picasso", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/sophie-turner-and-joe-jonas-adopt-adorable-new-puppy-named-waldo-picasso-100486", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The happy couple shared photos of their gorgeous new Alaskan Klee Kai, who is the brother of their other dog, Porky Basquiat.", "twitter": {"description": "The happy couple shared photos of their gorgeous new Alaskan Klee Kai, who is the brother of their other dog, Porky Basquiat.", "title": "Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas Adopt Adorable New Puppy Named Waldo Picasso", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/sophie-turner-and-joe-jonas-adopt-adorable-new-puppy-named-waldo-picasso-100486", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/joe_sophie.jpg?h=e244e6c5", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas Adopt Adorable New Puppy Named Waldo Picasso | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Sophie Turner, Joe Jonas, Pets", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
