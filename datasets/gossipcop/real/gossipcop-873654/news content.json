The options are unlimited, with layers, bangs, and length at your discretion. These short haircuts overflow with effortless style and timeless appeal, which makes the decision to lose that length easy as pie. Check out these short hairstyles to find the inspiration you need for your next chop.\n\nIt's no surprise that short haircuts have been taking over the beauty world this year more than ever before. A short haircut often packs more punch per inch than any long style in sight; and, if anything, the lack of inches just makes for way more personality, style, and panache. Unlike the decision to get major bangs, going for a short cut needs no debate. However, it's always best to scout your options before permanently chopping those locks, and luckily there are plenty of celebrities with short hair to provide proper inspiration.\n\n01 of 30 Natalie Portman's Super Pixie Credit: Evan Agostini/Getty Images Portman's stylist kept the top section of Portman's post-buzz cut hairstyle longer in order to give versatility.
