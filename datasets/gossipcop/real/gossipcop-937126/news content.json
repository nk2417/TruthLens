Markle received a simple Cleave and Company wedding band. Following in Windsor family tradition, it\u2019s fashioned from a piece rare Welsh gold from the Queen. A practice his great grandmother, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, kicked off in the early 20th century, royal brides in the family are gifted wedding bands crafted from nuggets of Welsh gold from the now-defunct Clogau St. David\u2019s Gold Mine. Because gold mining is currently inactive in Wales, the gold is especially valuable.\n\nMarkle is in good company with her newest accessory: the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Princess Diana and the Queen have all also worn the Welsh gold rings.\n\nThe wedding band joins her engagement ring, which also has yellow gold for a band, and features diamonds from a Botswana mine and from Princess Diana\u2019s own collection.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180521110943im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180521110943im_/http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180521110943im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180521110943im_/http://assets.time.com/images/idealmedia.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180521110943im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180521110943im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180521110943im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gettyimages-951694088.jpg?quality=85"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180521110943im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gettyimages-951694088.jpg?quality=85", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Raisa Bruner"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180521110943/http://time.com/5274561/meghan-markle-wedding-ring/", "title": "Everything to Know About Meghan Markle's Wedding Ring", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "meghan markle royal wedding, meghan markle wedding ring, meghan markle ring, meghan markle gold wedding ring, where is meghan markle's ring from", "news_keywords": "meghan markle royal wedding, meghan markle wedding ring, meghan markle ring, meghan markle gold wedding ring, where is meghan markle's ring from", "description": "All the details on Meghan Markle's royal wedding ring, joining her diamond engagement ring.", "og": {"title": "Everything to Know About Meghan Markle's Wedding Ring", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180521110943/http://time.com/5274561/meghan-markle-wedding-ring/", "description": "The wedding band joins her diamond engagement ring as a symbol of her marriage", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180521110943im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gettyimages-951694088.jpg?quality=85", "width": 1024, "height": 742}}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://time.com/5274561/meghan-markle-wedding-ring/", "description": "All the details on Meghan Markle's royal wedding ring, joining her diamond engagement ring.", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gettyimages-951694088.jpg?quality=85"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180521110943im_/http://time.com/5274561/meghan-markle-wedding-ring/", "title": "Everything to Know About Meghan Markle's Wedding Ring", "description": "The wedding band joins her diamond engagement ring as a symbol of her marriage", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180521110943im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/gettyimages-951694088.jpg?quality=85"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
