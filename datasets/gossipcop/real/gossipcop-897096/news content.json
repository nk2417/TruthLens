Many people have sang the song: \"I'ma buy you a drank / (Ooh wee) I'ma take you home with me.\" But the actual lyrics are: \"I'ma buy you a drank (And then) I'ma take you home with me.\"\n\nIn retrospect, this makes a lot more sense. But don\u2019t feel too bad if you\u2019ve been messing up the lyrics for the past decade. T-Pain insists the lyrics are \"whatever you want it to be.\" He\u2019s just grateful that you enjoy the record.\n\nThe news sparked shock and denial.\n\nT-Pain wasn\u2019t done. Shortly after he cleared up the lyrics for \"Buy U a Drank,\" he turned his attention to the 2010 DJ Khaled track \"All I Do Is Win,\" which featured him, Rick Ross, Ludacris, and Snoop Dogg. Many people misheard the hook\u2019s lyrics as: \"Everybody hands go up / And they stay there, and stay there.\" But T-Pain revealed that the actual line is: \u201cAnd they stay there, and they say yeah.\u201d\n\nHe apologized for the misunderstanding.\n\nTwitter's mind was blown for a second time today:", "images": ["https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723867001/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-1667-1670477920-77_16x9-6488726", "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,c_fill,ar_1.55,w_2048,g_auto/v1723867000/sanity-new/t-pain-aoki-foundation-fundraiser-2017-133488683.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723867001/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-1667-1670477920-77_16x9-6488726", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joshua Espinoza"], "canonical_link": "https://www.complex.com/music/a/cmplxjoshua-espinoza/t-pain-clarifies-buy-u-drank-all-i-do-is-win-lyrics", "title": "You've Probably Been Singing These T-Pain Lyrics Wrong fo...", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "T-Pain clarified the hooks on \"Buy U a Drank\" and DJ Khaled's \"All I Do Is Win.\"", "og": {"title": "You've Probably Been Singing These T-Pain Lyrics Wrong fo...", "description": "T-Pain clarified the hooks on \"Buy U a Drank\" and DJ Khal...", "url": "https://www.complex.com/music/a/cmplxjoshua-espinoza/t-pain-clarifies-buy-u-drank-all-i-do-is-win-lyrics", "site_name": "Complex", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723867001/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-1667-1670477920-77_16x9-6488726", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "@complex", "id": 13049362}, "title": "You've Probably Been Singing These T-Pain Lyrics Wro...", "description": "T-Pain clarified the hooks on \"Buy U a Drank\" and DJ Khaled's \"All I Do Is Win.\"", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723867001/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-1667-1670477920-77_16x9-6488726"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.complex.com", "summary": ""}
