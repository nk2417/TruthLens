That series, of course, is American Idol, which will move from Fox to ABC for the 2017-18 season.\n\nRather than suggest that she was comfortable with the network switch, however, Walden was refreshingly candid about how challenging it is to see a show that was so meaningful to Fox for 15 years move to a rival. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a tough one for us,\u201d she began. \u201cIt feels bad knowing it\u2019s coming back on another network.\u201d\n\nWalden was similarly open about her frustration with Idol producers Fremantle, with whom Fox had been having conversations since the music competition wrapped in spring 2016. At issue: Fox had invested a tremendous amount of equity and resources promoting and celebrating the show\u2019s final season. \u201cWe spent $25 million sending the message that it was the farewell season and fans responded,\u201d she said. And though it did see a ratings uptick, Walden and her team felt it would be deceitful, even, as she put it, \u201cextremely fraudulent,\u201d to turn around and immediately go back into production with the show. Fremantle felt differently.\n\nIn Walden\u2019s mind, waiting until 2020 would be a more respectful amount of time to have Idol sit on the bench. \u201cWe did not see the fan excitement and enthusiasm for the show to come back [sooner],\u201d she added, suggesting Fremantle had a different set of facts. The latter, for whom Idol is a significant revenue generator, was driven from the day it wrapped to see it return as soon as possible.\n\nBut timing was not the only point of contention between Fox and the show\u2019s producers. Among the others: the series\u2019 price tag, which had ballooned in later seasons thanks to judge and host salaries in the eight-figure range. Those coupled with declining ratings \u2014 the show was down nearly 70 percent in its last half-decade on the air \u2014 prompted Fox to ask Fremantle to make cuts before the series had wrapped on Fox.\n\n\u201cThe network was losing an enormous amount of money and we asked them to make trims,\u201d explained Walden, adding that Fremantle had little interest in such trims, which would entail tweaking the show or the panel of star wattage that took years to get just right. \u201cFremantle doesn\u2019t want to change that show and perhaps they shouldn\u2019t,\u201d she added, lingering frustration apparent in her voice. Despite it all, Fox continued to make offers for the show, if for no other reason than Walden and her team didn\u2019t want to see a show so closely connected with their brand land elsewhere.\n\nEarlier on in what she called a \u201cchallenging process,\u201d Walden believed it was NBC that Fox would be competing against, and she acknowledged that at least that made sense to her. NBC has both Simon Cowell, whom she believed the franchise missed in its later iterations, and Jennifer Lopez based at its network, which would be helpful in a reboot. Alas, conversations with NBC broke down and Fremantle had little interest in Fox\u2019s offer, so the show that famously catapulted Walden\u2019s network to No. 1 will now air on ABC.\n\nOn what was left of the call, Walden and Newman fielded a handful of other questions, including those about the fate of Scream Queens, 24: Legacy and Prison Break. The only one for which they\u2019d put a nail in the coffin: Scream Queens, acknowledging that this past season was the Ryan Murphy\u2019s anthology\u2019s last . They suggested they\u2019d reassess the future of 24 when they returned to Los Angeles post-upfront, saying that the delay on any decision was largely due to star Corey Hawkins\u2019 time on Broadway and producer Howard Gordon\u2019s quasi-sabbatical in Spain. As for the future of Prison Break, they have no intention of having that property return every year, but the producers are considering future ideas and, yes, their network would surely be open to more.\n\nHannah meets history teacher Fran when she starts substitute teaching at St. Justine\u2019s School.
