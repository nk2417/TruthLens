And while there were plenty of on-screen highlights, there were also lots of unseen moments.\n\nLuckily, ET was inside the annual event, which was sponsored by FIJI Water, to bring you some of the best off-camera gems from the night. Here they are:\n\nApparently it\u2019s not 5 o\u2019clock somewhere.\n\nStars went from the red carpet to a cocktail reception before the awards show began. But with the bar not opening until 5 p.m., several people were turned away, including Nick Jonas.\n\nMary J. Blige\u2019s birthday!\n\nThe soulful singer rang in her 47th birthday at the show, and was spotted snacking on some Oreos at her table. A reporter ordered her a birthday cake, but it tragically didn\u2019t arrive until after she\u2019d left the venue. That didn\u2019t stop others from enjoying it, including Angelina Jolie, Allison Janney, and Alison Brie, who all snagged a piece in her absence.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAngie\u2019s appreciation.\n\nJolie was spotted in the audience, thoroughly captivated by Gal Gadot\u2019s moving speech and video package. She kept her eyes glued to the stage, watching the whole scene intently.\n\nGetty Images\n\nStaying true to his roots.\n\nThis Is Us actor Milo Ventimiglia gave a standing ovation for his Gilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino after her new Amazon series, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, won Best Comedy Series. Ventimiglia played Rory Gilmore\u2019s love interest, Jess Mariano, on the beloved mother-daughter drama and reprised the role in the show\u2019s recent Netflix revival.\n\nET\n\nMagical treats!\n\nFlorida Project winner Brooklynn Prince and Wonder star Jacob Tremblay hit up the Yogurtland station after the awards show. Prince, who stole the show with her moving acceptance speech and celebrity encounters, was wearing her new Harry Potter robes from her recent trip to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter over her dress. She appeared to be representing the House of Hufflepuff.\n\nMissed the show?
