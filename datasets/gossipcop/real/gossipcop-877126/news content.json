{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justin_Bieber", "text": "Canadian singer (born 1994)\n\nNot to be confused with Justin Beaver\n\nJustin Drew Bieber ( BEE-b\u0259r; born March 1, 1994)[1][2] is a Canadian singer. Regarded as a prominent figure in contemporary popular music,[3][4] he rose to fame in the late 2000s after being discovered on YouTube, and his debut extended play, My World (2009), was met with international recognition and established him as a teen idol.\n\nBieber rose to further fame with his debut album, My World 2.0 (2010), which topped the US Billboard 200 \u2014 making him the youngest solo male to do so in 47 years.[5] Its lead single, \"Baby\" (featuring Ludacris), became one of the best selling singles in the United States, while its accompanying music video became the most disliked video on YouTube.[6][7] His second album, Under the Mistletoe (2011), became the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut atop chart.[8] Bieber explored dance-pop on his third album, Believe (2012); its acoustic re-release made him the first artist in Billboard history to have five US number-one albums by the age of 18.[9]\n\nBieber explored EDM with his 2015 single \"Where Are \u00dc Now\", which won the Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Recording.[10][11] This influenced his fourth album, Purpose (2015), which yielded the singles \"Love Yourself\", \"Sorry\", and \"What Do You Mean?\" \u2014 all three peaked the Billboard Hot 100, and simultaneously entered the top three spots on the UK singles chart \u2014 making him the first musical act to do so in the chart's history. Two of his 2017 guest appearances \u2014 on DJ Khaled's \"I'm the One\" and Luis Fonsi's \"Despacito\" \u2014 peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100, with the latter winning him a Latin Grammy Award.\n\nHis fifth and sixth albums, Changes (2020) and Justice (2021), both topped the Billboard 200; the latter included his seventh US-number one single \"Peaches\" and made him break Elvis Presley's 1965 record for the youngest solo act to have eight US number-one albums. Also in 2021, he released his eighth US number-one single, \"Stay\" (with the Kid Laroi). Bieber's seventh and eight album, Swag and Swag II, were released in 2025.\n\nBieber is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with over 150 million units sold worldwide and five diamond certifications from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[12] His accolades include two Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, eight Juno Awards, two Brit Awards, 26 Billboard Music Awards, 18 American Music Awards, and 22 MTV Europe Music Awards (the most wins for any artist). Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, and Forbes' listed him among the top ten most powerful celebrities from 2011 to 2013.[13] Billboard ranked him the eighth-greatest pop star of the 21st century.\n\nEarly life\n\nJustin Drew Bieber was born on March 1, 1994, at St. Joseph's Hospital in London, Ontario,[14] and was raised in Stratford.[15] His parents Jeremy Jack Bieber and Pattie Mallette were both 18 when Bieber was born and split up not long after his birth.[16] Pattie worked a series of low-paying office jobs, raising Bieber as a single mother in low-income housing. Mallette's mother Diane and stepfather Bruce helped her raise Bieber.[17] Bieber has maintained contact with his father.[18] Bieber's ancestry includes French, Irish, English, Scottish and German.[20][21]\n\nBieber has three younger half-siblings; the four have the same father, Jeremy Bieber. Jeremy Bieber and his ex-girlfriend, Erin Wagner,[22] who broke up in 2014 after seven years together, have two children, daughter Jazmyn and son Jaxon.[23] Jeremy married his girlfriend Chelsey in February 2018, and they have a daughter named Bay.[24][25] Bieber also has a stepsister named Allie, the daughter of his stepmother.[26] Bieber attended two French-language immersion elementary schools in Stratford, Jeanne Sauv\u00e9 Catholic School[17] and Bedford Public School. In grades 7 and 8, he attended Stratford Northwestern. Former teacher, Kim Booker often recalled fond memories of Bieber as her student, and is featured in several interviews. He attended Stratford's St. Michael Catholic Secondary School, and graduated in 2012[27] with a 4.0 GPA.[28]\n\nGrowing up, he learned to play the piano, drums, guitar, and trumpet.[15][29] In early 2007, aged 12, Bieber performed Ne-Yo's \"So Sick\" for a local singing competition in Stratford, in which he placed second.[29][30] Mallette posted a video of the performance on YouTube for their family and friends to see. She continued to upload videos of Bieber singing covers of various R&B songs, and Bieber's popularity on the site grew.[31] In the same year, Bieber busked shows in front of the Avon Theatre steps with a rented guitar during tourism season.[32]\n\nCareer\n\n2007\u20132009: Career beginnings and My World\n\nBieber at a signing event in 2009\n\nWhile searching for videos of a different singer, Scooter Braun, a former marketing executive of So So Def Recordings, clicked on one of Bieber's 2007 YouTube videos by accident, where he was covering Ne-Yo's \"So Sick\".[18][33] Impressed, Braun tracked down Bieber's school, the theatre Bieber was performing at, and finally contacted his mother Mallette, who was initially reluctant because of Braun's Judaism. She remembered praying, \"God, I gave him to you. You could send me a Christian man, a Christian label!\", and, \"God, you don't want this Jewish kid to be Justin's man, do you?\" However, church elders convinced her to let Bieber go with Braun. At age 13, Bieber went to Atlanta, Georgia, with Braun to record demo tapes.[18] Bieber began singing for Usher one week later.[34] Bieber soon signed with RBMG (Raymond Braun Media Group), a joint venture between Braun and Usher.[35] Justin Timberlake was reportedly also in the running to sign Bieber but lost the bidding war to Usher, partly due to the idea that two associated singers of the same name would confuse the market.[35][36]\n\nUsher then sought assistance in finding a label home for the artist from then manager Chris Hicks, who helped engineer an audition with his contact L.A. Reid of the Island Def Jam Music Group.[37] Reid signed Bieber to Island Records in October 2008 (resulting in a joint venture between RBMG and Island Records) and appointed Hicks as executive vice-president of Def Jam, where he could manage Bieber's career at the label.[38][31][35][37] Bieber then moved to Atlanta with his mother to pursue further work with Braun and Usher.[35] Braun became Bieber's manager in 2008.[31]\n\nBieber's first single, \"One Time\", was released to radio while Bieber was still recording his debut album.[39] The song reached number 12 on the Canadian Hot 100 during its first week of release in July 2009,[31] and peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States. During fall 2009, it had success in international markets.[40] The song was certified platinum in Canada and the US and gold in Australia and New Zealand.[41][42][43] His first release, an extended play titled My World, was released on November 17, 2009. The album's second single, \"One Less Lonely Girl\", and two promotional singles, \"Love Me\" and \"Favorite Girl\", were released exclusively on the iTunes Store and charted within the top 40 of the US Billboard Hot 100.[40] As a result, he became the first solo artist to have four singles chart in the top 40 of the Hot 100 before the release of a debut album.[44]\n\n\"One Less Lonely Girl\" was later also released to radio and peaked within the top 20 in Canada and the US, and was certified gold in the latter.[40] Following the release of My World, Bieber became the first artist to have seven songs from a debut album chart on the Billboard Hot 100.[45] My World was eventually certified platinum in the US and double platinum in both Canada and the United Kingdom.[46][47][48] To promote the album, Bieber performed on several live shows such as mtvU's VMA 09 Tour, European program The Dome, YTV's The Next Star, The Today Show,[49][50] The Wendy Williams Show, Lopez Tonight, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, It's On with Alexa Chung, Good Morning America, Chelsea Lately, and BET's 106 & Park. Bieber also guest starred in an episode of True Jackson, VP in late 2009.[51] Bieber performed Ron Miller and Bryan Wells's \"Someday at Christmas\" for US president Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama at the White House for Christmas in Washington, which aired on December 20, 2009, on US television broadcaster TNT.[52]\n\n2010\u20132011: My World 2.0, Never Say Never, and Under the Mistletoe\n\nBieber was a presenter at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards on January 31, 2010. He was invited to be a vocalist for the remake of the charity single \"We Are the World\" for its 25th anniversary to benefit Haiti after the earthquake. Bieber sings the opening line, which was sung by Lionel Richie in the original version.[53] On March 12, 2010, a version of K'naan's \"Wavin' Flag\", recorded by a collective of Canadian musicians known as Young Artists for Haiti, was released. Bieber is featured in the song, performing the closing lines.\n\nIn January 2010, \"Baby\" was released from his debut album, My World 2.0. The song featured Ludacris, and became an international hit. It charted at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaked at number three on the Canadian Hot 100[55] and reached the top ten in several international markets.[40] Promo singles, \"Never Let You Go\" and \"U Smile\", were top 30 hits on the US Hot 100, and top 20 hits in Canada.[40] The album has received generally favourable reviews.[56] It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, making Bieber the youngest solo male act to top the chart since Stevie Wonder in 1963.[5] My World 2.0 also debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, Irish Albums Chart, Australian Albums Chart, and the New Zealand Albums Chart[40] and reached the top 10 of fifteen other countries.[57][58]\n\nTo promote the album, Bieber appeared on live programs including The View, the 2010 Kids' Choice Awards, Nightline, Late Show with David Letterman, The Dome and 106 & Park.[59] Sean Kingston appeared on the album's next single, \"Eenie Meenie\". The song reached the top ten in the UK and Australia, and the top 20 of most other markets. The following single from My World 2.0, \"Somebody to Love\", was released in April 2010, and a remix was released featuring Bieber's mentor Usher. On June 23, Bieber went on his first official headlining tour, the My World Tour, to promote My World and My World 2.0. In May 2010, Bieber featured in rapper Soulja Boy's song \"Rich Girl\".[60] In July, it was reported that Bieber was the most searched-for celebrity on the Internet.[61] That same month, his video for \"Baby\" surpassed Lady Gaga's \"Bad Romance\" (2009) as the most viewed, and most disliked, YouTube video at the time.[62][63] In September, it was reported that Bieber accounted for 3% of traffic on Twitter, according to an employee of the social-networking site.[64]\n\nBieber performing in Indonesia during his My World Tour in 2011\n\nOn My World 2.0, Bieber's voice was noted to be deeper than it was in his debut EP, due to puberty.[65] In April 2010, the singer remarked regarding his vocals: \"It cracks. Like every teenage boy, I'm dealing with it and I have the best vocal coach in the world ... Some of the notes I hit on \"Baby\" I can't hit any more. We have to lower the key when I sing live.\"[66] Bieber guest-starred in the season premiere of the CBS American crime drama CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, which aired on September 23, 2010. He played a \"troubled teen who is faced with a difficult decision regarding his only brother\", who is also a serial bomber. Bieber was also in a subsequent episode of the series, which aired on February 17, 2011, in which his character is killed.[67] Bieber performed a medley of his singles \"U Smile\", \"Baby\", and \"Somebody to Love\", and briefly played the drums, at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards on September 12, 2010.[68] Bieber announced in October 2010 that he would be releasing an acoustic album, called My Worlds Acoustic.[69] It was released on November 26, 2010, in the United States and featured acoustic versions of songs from his previous albums, and accompanied the release of a new song titled \"Pray\".[70] In October 2010, Bieber released his first book, Justin Bieber: First Step 2 Forever: My Story, an autobiography with text from Bieber and photographs from Robert Caplin.[71]\n\nA 3-D part-biopic, part-concert film starring Bieber entitled Justin Bieber: Never Say Never, was released on February 11, 2011, directed by Step Up 3D director Jon M. Chu. It topped the box office with an estimated gross of $12.4 million on its opening day from 3,105 theatres.[72] It grossed $30.3 million for the weekend and was narrowly beaten by the romantic comedy Just Go with It, which grossed $31 million.[73] Never Say Never reportedly exceeded industry expectations, nearly matching the $31.1 million grossed by Miley Cyrus's 2008 3-D concert film, Hannah Montana & Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert, which holds the record for the top debut for a music-documentary.[74] Never Say Never grossed a total of $99,034,125 worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing concert or performance film at the global box office.[75][76] The film is accompanied by his second remix album, Never Say Never \u2013 The Remixes, released February 14, 2011, and features remixes of songs from his debut album, with guest appearances from Miley Cyrus, Chris Brown, and Kanye West, among others.[77] Bieber was a participating player in the 2011 NBA All-Star Celebrity Game, held on February 18, 2011, and was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP), scoring eight points (3\u201311 FG) with two rebounds and four assists.[78] In June 2011, an album track from Never Say Never titled \"That Should Be Me\" (featuring Rascal Flatts), won him his first award in country music for Collaborative Video of the Year at the CMT Music Awards. Time magazine named Bieber one of the 100 most influential people in the world on their annual list.[79] In June 2011, Bieber was ranked No. 2 on the Forbes list of Best-Paid Celebrities under 30. He is the youngest star, and 1 of 7 musicians on the list, having raked in $53 million in a 12-month period.[80] The same month, his collaborative single \"Next to You\" with American singer Chris Brown was released. The unfinished video for that song was leaked online on June 6, and the official video was released on June 17.\n\nOn November 1, 2011, Bieber released the Christmas-themed Under the Mistletoe, his second studio album.[81] It became the first Christmas album by a male artist to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, and sold 210,000 copies in its first week of release.[8] On November 19, 2021, the album was listed among the Greatest of All Time Top Holiday Albums chart by Billboard.[82] The first single from the album, \"Mistletoe\", peaked at number one on the US Billboard Holiday 100 and Holiday Digital Songs charts.[83] Bieber released \"All I Want for Christmas Is You (SuperFestive!)\" as the second single from the album, which is a re-recorded version of Mariah Carey's original single, \"All I Want for Christmas Is You\", with Carey providing vocals on the track.[84] Billboard listed the album and its singles, among the greatest Holiday albums and songs of all time, respectively.[85]\n\n2012\u20132014: Believe, Journals, and other appearances\n\nBieber at the 2012 NRJ Music Awards in Cannes, France\n\nIn late 2011, Bieber began recording his third studio album, titled Believe.[86] The following week, Bieber appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show to announce that the first single would be called \"Boyfriend\", and was released on March 26, 2012.[87] The song debuted at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100, selling a total of 521,000 digital units, the second-highest-ever debut digital sales week.[88] Bill Werde of Billboard noted that it failed to debut at number one because the digital download of the track was available only through the iTunes Store, \"restricting the buying option for those [who] do not frequent the Apple retail store\".[89] \"Boyfriend\" became Bieber's first single ever to reach the top position on the Canadian Hot 100 by debuting at number one and staying on for one week.[88] Bieber was featured on American hip-hop group Far East Movement's song \"Live My Life\", from their fourth studio album, Dirty Bass, in February 2012. The song emerged online five days before its scheduled release date and peaked within the top 30 of the Billboard Hot 100.[90] The first promotional single from the album, \"Die in Your Arms\", was released on May 29, 2012, and the second promotional single, \"All Around the World\" (featuring American rapper Ludacris), followed the next week.[91][92] The second single from Believe, \"As Long as You Love Me\" (featuring Big Sean), was released on June 11, 2012. It peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100.[93]\n\nHis third studio album, Believe, was released on June 19, 2012, by Island Records. The album marked a musical departure from the teen pop sound of his previous releases, and incorporated elements of dance-pop and R&B genres.[94] Intent on developing a more \"mature\" sound, Bieber collaborated with a wide range of urban producers for the release as well as some long-time collaborators, including Darkchild, Hit-Boy, Diplo, and Max Martin. Entertainment Weekly praised Bieber's musical shift, calling the album both a \"reinvention and a reintroduction\".[95] Rolling Stone noted the deeper voice and more \"intense\" beats found on the album, although it lampooned one of his euphemisms for newfound sexual maturity (\"If you spread your wings, you can fly away with me\").[96] Believe debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, becoming his fourth number-one album.[97][98][99] The album sold 57,000 copies in its first week in Canada, debuting atop the Canadian Albums Chart.[100] In September 2012, Bieber was featured on \"Beautiful\", a song from Carly Rae Jepsen's second studio album, Kiss.[101] In October 2012, the third single from Believe, \"Beauty and a Beat\" (featuring Nicki Minaj), was released.

His appearance was panned by critics[105][106] and cast members, including Kate McKinnon, who said Bieber was not comfortable with his hosting duties, and Bill Hader, who said he did not enjoy the presence of Bieber or his entourage. Hader added that in his eight years on the television program, Bieber was the only host who lived up to his reputation.[107][108]\n\nOn March 7, 2013, Bieber fainted backstage at London's O2 Arena after complaining of breathing problems throughout his concert performance and was taken to the hospital.[109] Bieber cancelled his second Lisbon, Portugal concert at the Pavilh\u00e3o Atl\u00e2ntico, which was to be held on March 12, because of low ticket sales. The concert held in the same venue on March 11 did go on as scheduled.[110] In mid-August 2013, a remixed duet version of Michael Jackson's previously unreleased song \"Slave to the Rhythm\", featuring Bieber, leaked online.[111] In response to criticism over this remix, the Michael Jackson Estate stated that it had not authorized the release of this recording, and has since made attempts to remove the song from as many web sites and YouTube channels as possible.[112] Later, a song titled \"Twerk\" by rapper Lil Twist, featuring Bieber as well as Miley Cyrus, also leaked.[113] In September, Bieber was featured in Maejor Ali's song \"Lolly\" with rapper Juicy J.[114] A music video for \"Melodies\", the debut single of American singer Madison Beer, was released in the same month featuring Bieber in a cameo appearance.[115]\n\nOn October 3, 2013, Bieber announced that he would release a new song every Monday for 10 weeks as a lead-up to the film Justin Bieber's Believe, which entered production in May 2012 and was released on December 25, 2013.

Chu returning as director.[116][117][118] The first song of Music Mondays, \"Heartbreaker\", was released on October 7. The second song, \"All That Matters\", was released on October 14, followed by \"Hold Tight\" on October 21, \"Recovery\" on October 28, \"Bad Day\" on November 4, and \"All Bad\" on November 11.

I don't want to start singing about things like sex, drugs and swearing. I'm into love, and maybe I'll get more into making love when I'm older. But I want to be someone who is respected by everybody.\"[249] But since then, Bieber gradually altered his artistry, with Peter Gicas of E! Online describing \"PYD\" as \"sexed-up\", while In Touch Weekly magazine said that his song with Maejor Ali and Juicy J \"Lolly\" might make his fans a bit uncomfortable because of its lyrics that refer to oral sex.[250][114] In 2015 Bieber released the EDM-fuelled album Purpose, where he collaborated with Skrillex,[251] and explored serious themes such as \"life experiences\", through \"feel-good music\".[252]\n\nVoice\n\nBieber initially sang with a boy soprano voice,[253] before his voice broke, as was evidenced during the debut performance of \"Pray\" at the 2010 American Music Awards. Sean Michaels of The Guardian described puberty as \"the biggest threat to his career\" at the time.[254] Jody Rosen commented that Bieber sings with \"swing and rhythmic dexterity\" on his debut album, noting his tone to be \"nasal\".[247] Bieber started to receive voice coaching from Jan Smith in 2008.[255]\n\nAs an adult singer, Bieber's voice type is tenor, with a vocal range spanning from the baritone A 2 to the high tenor F 5 .[256][257] In a review of his Purpose album, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph complimented his \"soft, supple and seductive singing\".[258] Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian also praised Bieber's \"affectedly breathy voice\", noting that \"the voice soon palls, but the songs are often interesting.\"[259] Reviewing his 2021 album, Justice, Pitchfork commented: \"Bieber is not a powerhouse vocalist, but he is a compelling one, casually dropping in a stray yodel here, a Mariah Carey\u2013indebted set of runs there. His voice has a palatable smoothness; he's mastered push-and-pull dynamics, and he swings effortlessly from a placid chest voice to a zephyr of a falsetto.\"[260]\n\nAchievements\n\nThroughout his career, Bieber has sold an estimated 150 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.[261][262]\n\nIn 2011, Bieber was honoured with a star in front of Avon Theater in Stratford, Ontario, Canada, where he used to busk when he was younger. On November 23, 2012, Bieber was presented with the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal by the former Prime Minister of Canada, Stephen Harper.

He achieved this feat as \"Love Yourself\", \"Sorry\" and \"What Do You Mean?\" charted at positions 1, 2 and 3 simultaneously.[145] The singles also peaked at number one in the US, making Bieber the first male artist since Justin Timberlake in 2007 to have three number-ones from an album.[135] He also became the first solo artist to chart three solo songs in the top five of the US Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously, and the first as a lead act since the Beatles in 1964.[136] \"Love Yourself\" topped Billboard's Year-End Hot 100 Chart in 2016, followed by \"Sorry\" at number two, and made Bieber only the third artist in history to hold the top-two positions of the Billboard Year-End Hot 100, after the Beatles in 1964 and Usher in 2004.[137] As of 2024, Bieber has set 35 Guinness World Records in his career, including eight that were achieved from the success of his album Purpose.

Highlighting his longevity, he was awarded the MTV Award for Best New Artist in 2010[289] and the MTV Award for Artist of the Year in 2021.[290] Rolling Stone India referred to him as the \"biggest popstar of our age\", \"one of the most captivating artists of the century\" and \"one of the world's most successful artists of all time\".[291] Bieber is often described as a pop icon, or simply an icon.[292][293][294][295] In a 2011 article comparing the cultural significance of Bieber to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Orlando Sentinel said that, \"Out of all the cultural icons who influence and inspire today's society, Justin Bieber is without a doubt one of the most prominent.\"[296] He is generally credited as an important figure in bridging music and social media, which rose to prominence in the late 2000s; Variety dubbed him \"a once-in-a-generation superstar who charted a swift and stunning rise from precocious YouTube talent to global phenomenon.\"[297]\n\nIn an article titled \"How Justin Bieber revolutionised careers in the music industry\" by The Guardian, Tom Fazakerley says:\n\nSocial media has transformed the way people, brands and musicians communicate. The likes of Myspace and even more so YouTube, have enabled budding artists to put their music out to a massive audience at the click of a finger. This has taken down the barriers to the music industry and reshaped the career path for budding artists ... Nowadays you can be your own artist, producer and promoter-and if you do this well, like Justin Bieber, you can really make it.[298]\n\nAt age 15, following the release of his 2009 singles \"One Time\" and \"One Less Lonely Girl\", Bieber's immediate popularity led him to appear on the likes of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, The Wendy Williams Show and Good Morning America.[299] He had achieved a global fandom who came to be known as Beliebers and his popularity was labelled \"Bieber Fever\",[299] with fan frenzies taking place in Liverpool,[300] Barcelona[301] and Paris,[302] among other territories. Bieber's intense fandom was considered to be reminiscent of \"Beatlemania\",[303] and his signature wings hairstyle at the time also drew comparisons to the Beatles' mop top hairstyle.[304] Bieber's adoration from teenage girls was also likened to those of Frank Sinatra in the 1940s and Elvis Presley in the 1950s.[305]\n\nHe's the only person in humanity who's grown up the way he has \u2013 with smartphones and cameras on him 24/7 ... Another kid can go out and have a good night on the town, and no one gives a crap, but Justin is the most Googled person on the planet \u2013 for four years straight! \u2014Scooter Braun, Bieber's manager, in 2013 [ 306 ]\n\nBieber maintained his global popularity during his transition to adulthood, achieving increased artistic recognition and credit in the process. In respect to Bieber's success as a teenager to a young adult, Variety said that Bieber is arguably the first mega pop star to come of age entirely in the social media era and also called him an \"Internet icon\".[297] The Conversation's Jo Adetunji said that Bieber is \"one of the most successful pop singers of recent years\".[307] Regarding his EDM-driven album Purpose (2015), which reached \"beyond the moment and trends\" of that period according to Adetunji, the writer argued that Bieber should be considered a serious creative artist. Adetunji compared the album to Madonna's Ray of Light (1998), Alanis Morissette's Jagged Little Pill (1995) and Justin Timberlake's FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006).[307] In an article about Bieber, Hugh McIntyre of Forbes stated, \"You may love him, you may hate him, but no matter how you feel about him, nobody can argue that Justin Bieber hasn't conquered the pop world ... The Grammy winner can turn essentially any track into a smash, and nobody can sell a single like he can these days.\"[308] Also calling Bieber \"an unstoppable force in music\", McIntyre lauded Bieber for achieving success in various genres, including R&B, electronic dance, hip hop and Latin.[308]\n\nBieber and his work have influenced various recording artists including Shawn Mendes,[309] Why Don't We,[310] Johnny Orlando,[311] and Niall Horan.[312] Singers Dua Lipa and Charlie Puth have stated that they were influenced by the discovery of Bieber on YouTube which inspired them to achieve the same.[313][314][315]\n\nPublic image\n\nBieber performing in Z\u00fcrich in 2011; he often wore purple clothes at the beginning of his career.\n\nUsher commented that while he and Bieber were both signed at the same age, \"I had the chance to ramp up my success, where this has happened to Bieber abruptly\". As a result, when he was younger, Usher, Braun, Bieber's bodyguard, and other adults surrounding Bieber constantly coached him on handling fame and his public image.[18] After signing Bieber, Usher appointed one of his former assistants, Ryan Good, to be Bieber's road manager and stylist. Good, once nicknamed Bieber's \"swagger coach\", created a \"streetwise look\" for the singer which consisted of baseball caps, hoodies, dog chains, and flashy sneakers. Amy Kaufman of The Los Angeles Times comments, \"Though a product of a middle-class suburban upbringing in Stratford, Ontario, Bieber's manner of dress and speech ('Wassup man, how you doin'?' or 'It's like, you know, whateva' ') suggest he's mimicking his favorite rappers.\"[316] In 2013, Bieber said he was \"very influenced by black culture\", but he neither thought \"of it as black or white\" nor tried to \"act or pose in a certain way\". To him, it was \"a lifestyle-like a suaveness or a swag\".[306]\n\nBieber was often featured in teen magazines such as Tiger Beat,[18] and has been labelled a \"teen heartthrob\".[317] In 2010, he was frequently criticized for looking and sounding younger than his age,[318] and the following year for an androgynous appearance, which had been commonly noted in the media, including his appearance on the cover of LOVE magazine's androgyny issue in 2011.[319] His signature wings hairstyle at the time brought much attention in particular.[304] His teen-pop music, image (especially as a heartthrob to girls), and the media attention he receives have additionally been criticized.[318] He has been a target of Internet bloggers and message board posters, especially users of the Internet message board 4chan and of YouTube.[320] Nick Collins of The Daily Telegraph said that \"Bieber's character appears to strike a particularly sour note with his Internet critics\" who have questioned his manner of speech, among other things.[318]\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, Bieber's teen heart-throb and clean-cut image was drastically affected due to his involvement in several controversial events. During this period, he abandoned his pet monkey in Germany, vomited onstage, was videoed while urinating in a bucket, cursed at a photograph of Bill Clinton, wore a gas mask in public, allegedly spat on fans (although this was later debunked),[321] was involved in an explicit image with a stripper, and allegedly assaulted his bodyguard and a limo driver.[322] Bieber's uncle, Brad Bieber, said that his troublesome behaviour was caused by his break-up with Selena Gomez.[322] In its March 2014 edition, Rolling Stone put Bieber on its cover alongside the title \"Bad Boy\".[322] The same year, Bieber adopted the pseudonym \"Bizzle\".[323] During the \"Bizzle\" phase, Bieber donned a quiff and often wore thick gold chains and baseball caps.[322]\n\nIn his early 20s, following the release of Purpose, Bieber's public image changed in a more positive light. He donned bleached blond hair and often wore rock-branded t-shirts\u2014including Marilyn Manson and Kurt Cobain t-shirts[324]\u2014flannel shirts, denim jackets, and ripped jeans.[325] He also wore kilts, a trend of 1990s fashion, on several occasions.[324] Vogue remarked that his fashion during this period was reminiscent of grunge fashion during the 1990s.[324] After his marriage in 2018, Bieber's persona continued to change. As his fan base got older and he got married, he transitioned away from the teenage heart-throb image, taking on a more mature personality and a more soft-spoken style of speech.[326][327] In an interview with Vogue in February 2019, Bieber said that he would \"laugh at his past self\".[328]\n\nWaxwork of Bieber at Madame Tussauds, London\n\nWax statues of Bieber with the hairstyle from his early career are on display at the Madame Tussauds wax museums in New York City, London, and Amsterdam.[329] In 2018, \"Steps to Stardom\", an exhibit on Bieber's early career, opened in his hometown of Stratford, Ontario at the Stratford Perth Museum, offering a collection of mementos from his formative years and rise to international stardom.[330] The items on display include a professional drum kit he owned as a younger child, his Grammy Award, microphones, his Stratford Warriors hockey jacket, and personal letters, including one from Michelle Obama.[330] Bieber made a number of visits to the museum.[331][332] \"Steps to Stardom\" was originally scheduled to close in October 2018 but the board of the museum extended its stay for at least another year after the exhibit broke attendance records set by its Anne Frank House exhibit in 2015.[333]\n\nAt age 17, and within just two years of his professional music career, Bieber was named amongst the Time 100 world's most influential people list[334] and was ranked number 2 on the Forbes Highest-Paid Celebrities Under 30 list.[335] He went on to be included on the Forbes annual list five more times; in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017.[335] He was also included on Forbes' list of the top ten most powerful celebrities in 2011, 2012, and 2013.[13]\n\n\"Beliebers\" gathering around the hotel where Bieber is supposed to be inside in Oslo, Norway in May 2012\n\nBieber's early fanbase developed on YouTube and predated the release of his debut album My World.[336] According to Jan Hoffman of The New York Times, part of Bieber's appeal stems from his YouTube channel. The Chicago Tribune noted that Bieber's fanbase, \"Beliebers\", was among the top words of 2010.[337] Long before the release of My World in November 2009, his YouTube videos attracted millions of views.[18] Braun recognized the appeal. Before flying him to Atlanta, Braun wanted to \"build him up more on YouTube first\" and had Bieber record more home videos for the channel. \"I said: 'Justin, sing like there's no one in the room. But let's not use expensive cameras.' We'll give it to kids, let them do the work, so that they feel like it's theirs\", recalled Braun.[18] Bieber continues to upload videos to the same channel and has opened a Twitter account, from which he interacts with fans regularly.[31] In January 2013, Bieber surpassed Lady Gaga as the most-followed person on Twitter for the first time and held the record for 11 months.[338]\n\nAs of 2024, Bieber is the fourth-most-followed user on Twitter and the most-followed musician on the platform, with over 110.3 million followers. His YouTube channel is currently the most viewed music channel for an individual on the platform, having attracted over 32 billion views. With over 73 million subscribers, he remains the most subscribed solo artist on YouTube and held the overall record for six years. 11 music videos by Bieber have surpassed over 1 billion views on YouTube (second most of all-time),[339] his most recent being \"Beauty and a Beat\".[340] The music video for Bieber's song \"Baby\" is among the most liked videos on YouTube, having received over 24 million likes since its upload in 2010.[341] Bieber was frequently a trending topic on Twitter when the feature first launched, as his fans frequently discussed him on the network, and was named the top-trending star on Twitter in 2010.[343][344]\n\nBusiness interests\n\nIn 2010, Bieber signed a deal with Proactiv.[345] In the same year, Bieber partnered with Nicole by OPI to launch a nail polish line \"The One Less Lonely Girl Collection\", which sold exclusively in Walmart.[346] Bieber's nail polish line sold one million bottles less than two months after its release.[347] Bieber endorsed Adidas, beside Derrick Rose and Venus Williams, in 2012.[348] He became the new \"face\" and \"body\" of Calvin Klein in early 2015.[349] Entertainment Tonight reported that Bieber had used MYO-X, a dietary supplement, in preparation for the photo shoot.[350] In June 2015, Bieber teamed up with StarShop, a new shopping app launched by Kevin Harrington.[351] Bieber has been credited with boosting the careers of other singers such as Carly Rae Jepsen and Madison Beer when he tweeted about them.[352][353]\n\nBieber has released four fragrances.[354] He launched his debut fragrance, Someday, in 2011;[354] it grossed more than three million US dollars in sales, at Macy's, in just under three weeks, which industry experts regard as a successful celebrity-led launch.[355][356] On the heels of that 2011 best-seller, he launched his second fragrance, Girlfriend, in June 2012.[357] His third fragrance, The Key, was launched in July 2013,[358] and his latest fragrance, Justin Bieber Collector's Edition, launched in 2014.[355]\n\nIn January 2019, Bieber launched his own clothing line called \"Drew House\", consisting of a wide range of products. Most products feature the brand's defining symbol of a simple yellow smiley-face logo with the text \"drew\" written across the front. Bieber trademarked the name for his company in February 2018.[359] In September 2019, after a year-long collaboration with Schmidt's Naturals CEO, Michael Cammarata, Bieber released his deodorant line, \"Here + Now\", designed for sensitive skin.[360][361][362] In October 2020, Bieber collaborated with Crocs on a limited edition of the brand's renowned clogs called \"Crocs x Justin Bieber\". The design draws on Crocs' classic clog range with inputs of purple and yellow, inspired by Bieber's personal clothing brand, Drew House. The limited edition clogs sold at select Crocs and partner e-commerce channels, Drew House's website, and Crocs retail stores in China and South Korea.[363]\n\nIn fall 2021, Bieber collaborated with Tim Hortons to launch a specialty version of Timbits known as \"timbiebs\". CNN credited the promotion's role in contributing to an increase in Tim Hortons' sales by 10.3% in the fourth quarter of 2021.[364] On February 7, 2022, Bieber starred in Balenciaga's first 2022 campaign alongside Kim Kardashian and Isabelle Huppert.[365][366] In April 2022, Italian brand Vespa revealed its collaboration with a new limited edition of its famed scooter curated by Bieber. The \"JUSTIN BIEBER X VESPA\" is modelled on a Piaggio Sprint base \u2013 available in 50, 100 and 100cc guise.[367] In May 2022, Bieber and Tim Hortons partnered once again in a new collaboration called the \"Biebs Brew\", a French vanilla cold brew, which was available in North American stores beginning June 6, 2022.[368]\n\nIn December 2022, Bieber launched a clean water technology company called \"Generosity\" that aims to provide sustainable drinking water by reducing the usage of single-serve plastic. Alongside Micah Cravalho, he showcased 150 water fountains at the 2022 FIFA World Cup held in Qatar. Generosity fountains dispense refillable alkaline water after connecting to a water source, and are expected to be commercially available at major venues and homes in 2023.[369]\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 2020, it was reported Bieber owned a $26 million home in Beverly Hills, California, as well as a lakeside home in Ontario.[370][371] As Bieber resides in the United States, he is reported to possess a non-immigrant O-1 visa for working status based on \"extraordinary ability or achievement\" in an artistic field.[372] Bieber has said he is not interested in obtaining U.S. citizenship, and has praised Canada as being \"the best country in the world\", citing its mostly government-funded health care system as a model example.[373] However, in September 2018, TMZ reported that Bieber had begun the process of becoming a United States citizen, following his marriage to Hailey Baldwin.[374]\n\nHealth\n\nBieber has struggled with mental health issues,[375] particularly depression and anxiety,[376][377] at various points during his career.[378] He has generally been open about these issues.[379][380] In his American YouTube docu-series Seasons (2020), the singer opened up about his struggles with addiction, with frequent consumption of the recreational drug lean, pills such as MDMA, and hallucinogenic mushrooms in the early stages of his career.[381]\n\nIn January 2020, Bieber announced on his Instagram that he had been diagnosed with Lyme disease. He also revealed that he had infectious mononucleosis, which affected his neurological and overall health.[382]\n\nIn February 2022, it was reported that Bieber had tested positive for COVID-19, two days after embarking on his fourth concert tour, the Justice World Tour.[383] In June of the same year, Bieber announced that he had been diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2 and that half of his face was paralyzed.[384] He cancelled and postponed concerts and appearances due to the condition, but returned to live performances in late July.[385][386] In September, two days after the first concert in Latin America as part of the Rock in Rio festival, it was announced that all remaining dates of the tour would be suspended due to Bieber prioritizing his health. In a statement shared on social media, the singer said that \"After getting off stage, the exhaustion overtook me and I realized that I need to make my health the priority right now. So I'm going to take a break from touring for the time being. I'm going to be OK, but I need time to rest and get better.\"[387]\n\nRelationships\n\nBieber's father, Jeremy, is a former carpenter and pro-am mixed martial artist.[388] In March 2014, Rolling Stone characterized Jeremy as having \"split with Justin's mom when Justin was a toddler, and wasn't always around afterward. But he has, as of late, accepted a place of honor in his superstar son's entourage\".[389]\n\nFrom 2008 to 2009, Bieber was in a relationship with Caitlin Beadles; the two remained friends, and Beadles attended Bieber's wedding.[390] From December 2010 to March 2018, Bieber was in an on-again, off-again relationship with singer and actress Selena Gomez.[391][392][393][394] In an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, Bieber stated that some of his songs including \"Sorry\", \"Mark My Words\", and \"What Do You Mean?\" are about his relationship with Gomez.[395] From August to December 2016, he was linked to model Sofia Richie.[396][397]\n\nBieber became engaged to model and longtime friend Hailey Baldwin on July 7, 2018.[398] They had briefly dated from December 2015 to January 2016, before reconciling in June 2018.[399] Bieber and Baldwin reportedly obtained a marriage license in September 2018, leading to reports that they had a civil marriage.[400][401] On September 14, 2018, Baldwin said on Twitter that she and Bieber had not yet married, but deleted the tweet afterward.[401] On November 23, 2018, Bieber stated he was married to Baldwin.[402] Bieber and Baldwin had an official ceremony in Bluffton, South Carolina, on September 30, 2019.[403] On May 9, 2024, Bieber announced through an Instagram post that he and Baldwin were expecting their first child.[404] On August 23, 2024, they welcomed a boy, Jack Blues Bieber.[405][406]\n\nReligious beliefs\n\nBieber has described himself as a faithful Christian, said he communicates with God via prayer, and that \"He's the reason I'm here\".[407] He reflected his faith in a music video with Brandon Burke, titled \"#iPledge\", in which he talks about God's forgiveness.[408] Bieber was baptized on January 9, 2014, by Pentecostal pastor Carl Lentz of Hillsong Church, New York, after a born again experience. He has described Lentz as a good friend.[409][410] In 2021, he announced that he had become a member of Churchome, an evangelical church.[411] On July 24, 2021, Bieber led worship with Gospel singers Kari Jobe and Cody Carnes during the \"Freedom Experience\" at SoFi Stadium.[412] The trio sang \"The Blessing\".[413]\n\nWhen asked how he wants to raise his children, Bieber replied, \"I'm a Jesus follower. When you accept Jesus, you walk with the Holy Spirit. I just want to be led by the Holy Spirit.\"[414][415] Many of Bieber's tattoos have religious significance including the medium-sized cross on his chest and a tiny cross under his eye. Bieber also covered up the \"Son of God\" text tattooed on his abdomen with a large design that features two angels, gothic arches, a skeleton, and a serpent.[416]\n\nOpinions\n\nRegarding sexual abstinence, Bieber told music magazine Rolling Stone in 2011, \"I don't think you should have sex with anyone unless you love them.\" He added that he does not \"believe in abortion\", and that it is \"like killing a baby\". When asked about the case of abortion with regard to rape, he said, \"I guess I haven't been in that position, so I wouldn't be able to judge that.\"[373][417] In 2022, amidst Roe v. Wade being overturned, both Bieber and his wife expressed disapproval, with Bieber posting on his Instagram story stating \"For what it's worth, I think women should have the choice what to do with their own bodies.\"[418] His view on sexual orientation is quoted as \"everyone's own decision\",[419] and he has contributed to the It Gets Better Project,[420] a non-profit group aiming to prevent suicide among LGBT youth.[421] Bieber also opposed the Trump administration family separation policy, calling for Donald Trump to \"also let those kids out of cages\" in 2019.[422]\n\nIn 2011, Bieber was among the list of content creators opposing Bill S.978, also known as the Commercial Felony Streaming Act,[423] which would have made unauthorized streaming a felony instead of a misdemeanor.[424] He stated that the bill's sponsor, U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, \"needs to be locked up, put away in cuffs!\"[423] While the bill did not ultimately pass,[425] it was later reintroduced by Senator Thom Tillis as the Protecting Lawful Streaming Act,[426] and was signed into law by then-President Donald Trump in December 2020 as part of the omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021.[427]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nBieber supports Pencils of Promise,[428] a charity founded by Adam Braun, the younger brother of Bieber's manager.[429] The organization builds schools in developing countries, and Bieber became manager for the organization's campaign in Guatemala. He serves as a celebrity spokesman for the organization[430] by running ads for the charity and its campaign \"Schools4All\".[431][432] He promises to visit schools that donate the most funds to the organization.[433] He takes part in the charity's fund-raising galas and donates parts of the proceeds from his concerts and Someday line of fragrances,[434] and various merchandising to the charity. In 2010, Bieber supported a campaign for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) by urging fans to adopt abandoned pets from shelters.[435] Bieber donated his hair to Ellen DeGeneres during his appearance in her talkshow The Ellen DeGeneres Show in March 2011. His hair sold on eBay for more than $40,000 and the proceeds benefited the animal rescue charity, The Gentle Barn.[436] Following the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March 2011, Bieber donated proceeds from his concerts in Japan to Japanese Red Cross in May 2011.[437] In December 2011, Bieber donated $100,000 to Whitney Elementary School in Las Vegas to provide students from low income families.[438] Bieber supported Charity: Water which is a nonprofit that brings potable drinking water to people in developing countries. On his birthday in 2011 and 2012, he launched his campaign to urge his followers to donate on Twitter.[439] Bieber was named top charitable celeb of 2011 by American news aggregator and blog HuffPost.\n\nIn 2013, Bieber launched his online #GiveBackPhilippines campaign for helping the victims of Typhoon Haiyan and travelled to the Philippines after raising $3 million. His work in the country earned him a star on the Philippine Walk of Fame.[440] He also supports Children's Miracle Network Hospitals and Alzheimer's Association.[441] In September 2017, Bieber donated $25,000 to the American Red Cross to help people in Texas after the severe destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey.[442]\n\nOn February 7, 2020, Bieber donated $100,000 to Julie Coker, a 22-year-old fan who works in mental health awareness.[443] Coker revealed that her own past struggles with mental health motivated her to work for mental health. She praised Bieber by saying, \"[Bieber] has a big following, so if he has a good message about mental health, hopefully everybody else . . . will want to start thinking about mental health in a different way.\"[444]\n\nIn February 2020, Bieber made a donation to Beijing Chunmiao Children Aid Foundation in China to support COVID-19 relief.[445] Bieber and Ariana Grande collaborated on the single \"Stuck With U\", released in May 2020 as the first of series of singles coordinated by Scooter Braun, who is also Bieber's manager, to support the COVID-19 pandemic.[446] All net proceeds from the song went to the First Responders Children's Foundation to fund grants and scholarships for children of first responders and health care workers who worked on the front lines during the pandemic.[447] By August 2021, the single had raised over $3,500,000.[448] In September 2020, Bieber and Chance the Rapper announced that they've partnered with Cash App and will donate $250,000 to fans who are struggling during the pandemic.[449]\n\nIn March 2021, Bieber visited the California State Prison in Los Angeles County along with his wife Hailey and pastor Judah Smith at the invitation of Scott Budnick.[450] Bieber met with inmates involved in The Urban Ministry Institute and expressed support for Budnick's Anti-Recidivism Coalition. During the visit, Bieber committed to provide buses to transport relatives of the inmates who have been unable to see them due to the COVID-19 pandemic in California.[450] Bieber described his visit to the prison as a \"life-changing experience that I will never forget\".[451]\n\nLegal issues and controversies\n\nBieber had several run-ins with the law around the world before his first arrest in 2014,[452] including when he was accused of reckless driving in his neighbourhood in 2012, charged in Brazil with vandalism in 2013,[452][453] and was ordered to appear in Argentina within 60 days by a Buenos Aires court to give testimony on an alleged assault on a photographer on November 9, 2013.[454] In April 2013, Bieber was criticized for writing a message in the guestbook at the Anne Frank House that read, \"Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a great girl. Hopefully she would have been a belieber.\"[455] After the message was posted on the museum's Facebook page, Bieber received widespread criticism on social media for perceived insensitivity and narcissism. The Anne Frank House defended Bieber, stating, \"He's 19. It's a crazy life he's living, he didn't mean bad ... He was very interested in the story of Anne Frank and stayed for over an hour. We hope that his visit will inspire his fans to learn more about her life and hopefully read the diary.\"[456][457]\n\nOn January 23, 2014, Bieber was arrested in Miami Beach, Florida, together with singer Khalil, on suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI), driving with an over-six-month-expired licence, and resisting arrest without violence.[453][458][459] Police said that Bieber told authorities he had consumed alcohol, smoked marijuana, and taken prescription drugs.[452] He was released from these charges on a $2,500 bond.[460] A toxicology report revealed that Bieber had THC (a principal constituent of cannabis) and the anti-anxiety medication Xanax in his system at the time of his arrest.[461][462] In January 2021, he reflected on this event, describing it as \"not [his] finest hour\" and encouraging fans to \"let the forgiveness of Jesus take over and watch your life blossom into all that God has designed you to be.\"[463] On August 13, 2014, the January DUI case was settled with a plea bargain; Bieber pleaded guilty to resisting an officer without violence and a lesser charge of driving without due care and attention. He was fined US$500 and sentenced to attend a 12-hour anger management course and a program that teaches the impact of drunken driving on victims. As part of the plea bargain, he made a US$50,000 contribution to Our Kids, a local children's charity.[464][465]\n\nBieber's mugshots taken on January 23, 2014, after being detained by police in Miami Beach\n\nFollowing Bieber's arrest on the DUI charge, more than 270,000 people petitioned the White House seeking to have him deported from the United States. Although the number of signatures received was sufficient to require a response under published White House guidelines, the Obama administration declined substantive comment on the petition.[466] Immigration Law expert Harlan York noted that the likelihood of Bieber being deported was extremely slim. York stated, \"About a decade ago, the Supreme Court ruled that driving under the influence, typically, is not a basis to deport someone.\"[467]\n\nIn June 2014, a video emerged of a 15-year-old Bieber telling a joke about black people, which used the word \"nigger\" multiple times.[468] In the same month, a second video showed a 15-year-old Bieber giggling as he sings his song \"One Less Lonely Girl\", but parodying the main lyric as \"One less lonely nigger\", and stating that if he were to kill one, he would be \"part of the KKK\".[469][470] He apologized the day the latter was released: \"Facing my mistakes from years ago has been one of the hardest things I've ever dealt with.\"[471]\n\nOne of his neighbours in Calabasas, California, accused Bieber of throwing eggs at his home on January 9, 2014, and causing thousands of dollars of damage.[452][472][473] On July 9, 2014, Bieber was charged with one misdemeanour count of vandalism in California for throwing eggs at his Calabasas neighbour's home in January.[473][474][475] Police earlier claimed that they had video footage of him high-fiving friends after the eggs were thrown.[473][476] He pled no contest to the charge. Since then, he has permanently moved to Beverly Hills, California.[473][474][475] On September 1, 2014, Bieber was arrested and charged with assault and dangerous driving near his hometown of Stratford, Ontario, after a collision between a minivan and Bieber's all-terrain vehicle on August 29. Ontario police said that he then \"engaged in a physical altercation\" with an occupant of the minivan. He was released shortly and his lawyer blamed the incident on \"the unwelcome presence of paparazzi\".[477][478]\n\nI didn't want to come off arrogant or conceited, or basically how I've been acting the past year, year and a half ... although what's happened in the past has happened, I just want to ... be kind and loving and gentle and soft. \u2014Bieber reflects in a video posted in January 2015 [ 479 ]\n\nIn July 2017, the Chinese government banned Bieber from performing in China. A Chinese Bieber fan contacted the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture requesting the reason for the ban. The Bureau released a statement, explaining \"Justin Bieber is a gifted singer, but he is also a controversial young foreign singer\", and \"In order to maintain order in the Chinese market and purify the Chinese performance environment, it is not suitable to bring in badly behaved entertainers.\"[480][481] In 2021, Chinese streaming sites Youku, iQIYI, and Tencent Video removed Bieber's scenes in Friends: The Reunion donning Ross Geller's \"Spudnik\" costume.[482] However, his albums Changes (2020) and Justice (2021) have been officially released in China, with Bieber seen promoting both albums on Chinese music platforms.[483][484]\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nFilmography\n\nTours\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nOfficial website", "images":
