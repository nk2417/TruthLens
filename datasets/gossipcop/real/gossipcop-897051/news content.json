On Wednesday, mere hours after NBC announced that it had fired the Today anchor because of a complaint about alleged sexual misconduct, Variety has dropped a report with hideous allegations about the TV star\u2019s alleged behavior. The claims run the gamut: he made lewd sexual remarks about female colleagues; he once invited a female employee to his secluded office, then showed her his penis; he gave one female colleague a sex toy with \u201can explicit note about how he wanted to use it on her,\u201d Variety writes.\n\nThe allegations don\u2019t stop there. Lauer would also reportedly quiz female producers about their sex lives, and play a crass, office-themed version of the game \u201cfuck, marry, or kill.\u201d He also reportedly had a button on his desk that allowed him to lock the door; two women tell Variety that it enabled him to \u201cwelcome female employees and initiate inappropriate contact while knowing nobody could walk in on him.\u201d One former producer \u201cwho knew firsthand of these encounters\u201d also told Variety that Lauer, who is married, allegedly cheated on his wife.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of consensual relationships, but that\u2019s still a problem because of the power he held,\u201d this person said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t sleep around town with celebrities or on the road with random people, because he\u2019s Matt Lauer and he\u2019s married. So he\u2019d have to do it within his stable, where he exerted power, and he knew people wouldn\u2019t ever complain.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Lauer have not yet responded to Vanity Fair\u2019s request for comment. Variety notes that he could not be reached for comment. The piece is the result of a two-month investigation which stretches back before The New York Times dropped its stunning Harvey Weinstein piece, which kicked off the sexual misconduct reckoning in Hollywood and beyond. Like Weinstein prior to the controversy, Lauer is a powerful figure in the entertainment industry. He\u2019s been the face of the Today show for years, raking in an incredibly lucrative $25-million annual salary, per Variety. That\u2019s why it was a shock for industry insiders to learn that NBC fired him so quickly, before any bombshell investigative report broke the alleged scandal.\n\nShortly after Variety published its report, the Times published one as well, reporting that NBC had received two additional complaints about Lauer. One was from a former employee who says she had sex with Lauer in his office in 2001. She told the Times, she \u201cfelt helpless because she didn\u2019t want to lose her job,\u201d adding that she \u201cdidn\u2019t report the encounter at the time because she felt ashamed.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1f288f6a281c2f0d02b052/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Lauer-Updates.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6904b792447a00332ceb4fd3/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1f288f6a281c2f0d02b052/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Lauer-Updates.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fbde150b3b961d91154947/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1ef34860168f2614491326/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/matt-lauer-hollywood-daily.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691505934f93271855d8a78a/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69177930e84ad375fd84ec60/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69134e1408e5ee77e37d2651/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62fe7af0987db7065a9e93f4/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1ec93793339e4d17d819d5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/matt-lauer-fired.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6919bbed01714426f5a0dc01/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e0661d7f7e7718194d67e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690910a959c3a0008231faac/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1ef6cdfb9c553c41e259e0/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/matt-lauer-fired-sexual-misconduct-allegations-today-show-clip-2012.png", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691755d7cf2db08d53ca35a0/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1f288f6a281c2f0d02b052/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Lauer-Updates.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Yohana Desta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/matt-lauer-sexual-misconduct-allegations", "title": "Graphic, Disturbing Details of Matt Lauer\u2019s Alleged Sexual Misconduct", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Yohana Desta", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "A bombshell Variety report alleges Lauer gave one female colleague a sex toy, and more.", "id": "5a1f1e2525e85845faacf667", "keywords": "matt lauer,today show,sexual misconduct", "news_keywords": "matt lauer,today show,sexual misconduct", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a1f1e2525e85845faacf667", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"A bombshell Variety report alleges Lauer gave one female colleague a sex toy, and more.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1f288f6a281c2f0d02b052/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Lauer-Updates.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1f288f6a281c2f0d02b052/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Lauer-Updates.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "A bombshell Variety report alleges Lauer gave one female colleague a sex toy, and more.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1f288f6a281c2f0d02b052/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Lauer-Updates.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Graphic, Disturbing Details of Matt Lauer\u2019s Alleged Sexual Misconduct", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/matt-lauer-sexual-misconduct-allegations"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-11-29T22:24:00.453Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-29T22:24:00.453Z", "author": "Yohana Desta"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "A bombshell Variety report alleges Lauer gave one female colleague a sex toy, and more.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1f288f6a281c2f0d02b052/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Lauer-Updates.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Graphic, Disturbing Details of Matt Lauer\u2019s Alleged Sexual Misconduct"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1f288f6a281c2f0d02b052/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/Lauer-Updates.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google": "nopagereadaloud", "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511994240.453, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
