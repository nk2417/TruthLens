During Monday night\u2019s The Late Late Show, Corden explored \u201creal people acting out the movie live in front of a movie audience,\u201d enlisting the help from the star-studded cast of A Wrinkle in Time.\n\nWhile moviegoers were watching an advanced screening of the film at The Grove in Los Angeles, Corden\u2019s image appeared onscreen as a surprise. \u201cYou are probably wondering what happened to the movie you\u2019re watching\u2026 but what you don\u2019t know is that tonight you have purchased a ticket to the future,\u201d Corden explained, before later introducing himself \u201clive,\u201d along with the film\u2019s stars Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling, Oprah Winfrey and Storm Reid, all dressed in character.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s weird being in a theater and not giving away cars or anything. I\u2019m not used to that,\u201d Winfrey joked in her backstage interview. Meanwhile, Kaling quipped that their surprise performance was simply a \u201cbad school play but with adults.\u201d\n\nThroughout their performance, Corden acted as the film\u2019s narrator, instructing the actresses to perform various scenes from the film. In one scene, Corden asks the stars to spin as if they are journeying into a wrinkle in time, something Winfrey didn\u2019t find amusing: \u201cYou know what I had to do on Colbert? Nothing. Just sit there, talk about the movie. You know what I had to do here?\u201d\n\nAfter completing the first scene, Corden took the actresses backstage, questioning who among the cast can give an \u201cuplifting, inspiring, motivational speech,\u201d referring to Winfrey\u2019s recent acceptance speech during the Golden Globes. In other comical moments of the performance, Corden dubs Witherspoon as \u201cAmerica\u2019s sweetheart\u201d and instructs the actress to continuously repeat her title in the mirror, until she begins to grow too enthusiastic. \u201cAmerica\u2019s fucking sweetheart,\u201d Witherspoon yelled, then punching Corden in the face.\n\nMeanwhile, when Winfrey finds herself frustrated with the skit, she begins arguing with Corden.\u201cYou told me this was going to be Make a Wish for a sick child,\u201d Winfrey tells Corden, as the late-night host then argues: \u201cWell it is my wish and I have a childlike spirit and I\u2019m feeling a bit under the weather.\u201d\n\nAfter concluding their live performance, Winfrey revealed that the act was her \u201cproudest\u201d moment. \u201cReally?\u201d Corden excitedly asks, only for Winfrey to bluntly respond, \u201cNo.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/112108_0224b_copy_-_h_2018_1.jpg?w=768&h=433&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/112108_0224b_copy_-_h_2018_1.jpg?w=768&h=433&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lexy Perez", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/james-corden-acts-wrinkle-time-reese-witherspoon-oprah-winfrey-mindy-kaling-1094179/", "title": "James Corden Acts Out \u2018A Wrinkle in Time\u2019 With the Cast", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The late-night host enlists the help of Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling and Storm Reid to perform to a live movie audience in Los Angeles.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Lexy Perez", "tags": "A Wrinkle in Time, James Corden, Mindy Kaling, Oprah Winfrey, Reese Witherspoon, The Late Late Show", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "James Corden Acts Out \u2018A Wrinkle in Time\u2019 With the Cast", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/james-corden-acts-wrinkle-time-reese-witherspoon-oprah-winfrey-mindy-kaling-1094179/", "description": "The late-night host enlists the help of Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling and Storm Reid to perform to a live movie audience in Los Angeles.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/112108_0224b_copy_-_h_2018_1.jpg?w=768&h=433&crop=1", "width": 768, "height": 433, "alt": "James Corden Acts Out 'Wrinkle in Time' With Reese Witherspoon, Oprah"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-13T09:32:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-13T12:26:39+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The late-night host enlists the help of Reese Witherspoon, Oprah Winfrey, Mindy Kaling and Storm Reid to perform to a live movie audience in Los Angeles.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "James Corden Acts Out \u2018A Wrinkle in Time\u2019 With the Cast", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/112108_0224b_copy_-_h_2018_1.jpg?w=768&h=433&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520933564.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
