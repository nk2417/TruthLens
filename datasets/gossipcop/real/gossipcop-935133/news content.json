The details remain unclear. But in a series of vague tweets, the actress made several startling claims\u2014including, it seems, that she left the show following \u201cmultiple physical assaults.\u201d\n\nPerrette, who has played fan favorite Abby Sciuto on the CBS procedural since its premiere in 2003, had so far kept silent about her specific reasons for leaving the series this spring. In a statement last year announcing her departure, the actress wrote, \u201cThere have been all kinds of false stories as to why [she was leaving]. (NO I DON\u2019T HAVE A SKIN CARE LINE AND NO MY NETWORK AND SHOW ARE NOT MAD AT ME!) It was a decision made last year.\u201d Over the weekend, Perrette also referenced articles she claims are false, writing, \u201cI refused to go low, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve never told publicly what happened. But there are tabloid articles out there that are telling total lies about me. If you believe them? Please leave me alone. You clearly don\u2019t know me. (Sorry guys, had to be said).\u201d\n\nIn the past, Perrette has identified herself on Twitter as a rape and domestic violence survivor. Last fall, after reports about Harvey Weinstein emerged, she shared her own story, writing that she was raped in high school by a football player: \u201cMy rape led me into a series of abusive relationships, terrible self worth and self blame, dismissing a few groping incidents, allowing myself to be bullied by a powerful man for way too long.\u201d\n\nA day after her initial tweet regarding N.C.I.S. over the weekend, Perrette elaborated with a few more: \u201cMaybe I\u2019m wrong for not \u2018spilling the beans,\u2019\u201d she wrote. \u201cTelling the story, THE TRUTH. I feel I have to protect my crew, jobs and so many people. But at what cost? I don\u2019t know. Just know, I\u2019m trying to do the right thing, but maybe silence isn\u2019t the right thing about crime. I\u2019m... Just... ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a \u2018machine\u2019 keeping me silent, and feeding FALSE stories about me,\u201d Perrette continued. \u201cA very rich, very powerful publicity \u2018machine\u2019. No morals, no obligation to truth, and I\u2019m just left here, reading the lies, trying to protect my crew. Trying to remain calm. He did it.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5afadbc54530126a8038c657/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Pauley-Perrette-Leaves-NCIS.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5afadbc75650d54955bc0627/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/l-Pauley-Perrette-Leaves-NCIS.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/66e3496b1d2e398b5578d9d4/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fbde150b3b961d91154947/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69120b5a02774bc2b727aee8/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5af30fac310ffe7fb0da4c0e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/NCIS-Abby.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e42b058b9f4acdad0c3b4/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6901026c7b6db29214cd9d68/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e0661d7f7e7718194d67e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691755d7cf2db08d53ca35a0/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6914ab554a83822bb12772b6/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59d4ef4023be0019b3d7763e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/108685_0373b.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fb8e54c721f87930d61aba/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690cf5156fd8f93f16471dcd/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690a490b7e88452d77fcf4b2/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5afadbc54530126a8038c657/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-Pauley-Perrette-Leaves-NCIS.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Bradley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/05/pauley-perrette-ncis-exit-multiple-physical-assaults-allegations", "title": "Pauley Perrette Implies She Left N.C.I.S.
