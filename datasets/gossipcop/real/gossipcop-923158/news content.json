{"url": "https://deadline.com/2017/09/roseanne-reboot-emma-kenney-darlene-david-daughter-cast-1202174822/", "text": "Emma Kenney, a series regular on Showtime\u2019s Shameless, has joined the cast of ABC\u2018s reboot of Roseanne. She has been set to play the daughter of Darlene and David Connor in the revival of the series; Sara Gilbert is returning as Darlene and Big Bang Theory\u2018s Johnny Galecki is expected to return as David.\n\nRoseanne Barr, John Goodman, Laurie Metcalf, Michael Fishman, Lecy Goranson and Sarah Chalke also return for the new take on the Connor clan. Production on an eight-episode run is set to begin next month for an early 2018 premiere.\n\nKenney has played Debbie Gallagher for the entire duration of Shameless\u2018 run, so she knows about playing a kid in a dysfunctional family (spoiler alert: no TV family can touch the Gallaghers for dysfunction). That series returns for its eighth season November 5.\n\nBarr is executive producing Roseanne with Gilbert, Tom Werner, Bruce Helford, Whitney Cummings and Tony Hernandez. The series hails from Carsey-Werner Television.", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/emma-kenney.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/emma-kenney.jpg?w=1024"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/emma-kenney.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patrick Hipes", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2017/09/roseanne-reboot-emma-kenney-darlene-david-daughter-cast-1202174822/", "title": "\u2018Roseanne\u2019: \u2018Shameless\u2019 Star Emma Kenney Set As Darlene And David\u2019s Daughter", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Emma Kenney, a series regular on Showtime's Shameless, has joined the cast of ABC's reboot of Roseanne.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Patrick Hipes", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Roseanne\u2019: \u2018Shameless\u2019 Star Emma Kenney Set As Darlene And David\u2019s Daughter", "url": "https://deadline.com/2017/09/roseanne-reboot-emma-kenney-darlene-david-daughter-cast-1202174822/", "description": "Emma Kenney, a series regular on Showtime's Shameless, has joined the cast of ABC's reboot of Roseanne.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/emma-kenney.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 1355, "alt": "Emma Kenney"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-22T00:53:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2024-12-19T00:09:37+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Emma Kenney, a series regular on Showtime's Shameless, has joined the cast of ABC's reboot of Roseanne.", "site": "@Deadline", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Roseanne\u2019: \u2018Shameless\u2019 Star Emma Kenney Set As Darlene And David\u2019s Daughter", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/emma-kenney.jpg?w=774"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506041631.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
