A somber Leto shared personal memories of both, beginning with Cornell, and how Bennington (a friend of the late Soundgarden/Audioslave singer) actually sang Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah\u201d at his funeral.\n\nOn the Linkin Park vocalist (who committed suicide July 20), Leto remarked, \u201cWhen I think about Chester, I see his face, which was always smiling. I think about his heart, which he wore on his sleeve. I think about how kindly he treated [Thirty Seconds to Mars]. I think about his wife and how incredibly he treated his six children.\u201d\n\nAfter that, he asked the Los Angeles crowd to get on its feet, and wouldn\u2019t continue until it complied. \u201cReach out, share your thoughts, do not give up,\u201d he implored those suffering like Cornell and Bennington. \u201cThere is always a way forward. The biggest breakthroughs in life lie just beyond the darkest days.\u201d\n\nTo cap off the poignant moment, the VMAs\u2019 big screen played a snippet of Linkin Park\u2019s performance from the 2010 edition of the award show, their single \u201cThe Catalyst,\u201d rocked out at Los Angeles\u2019 Griffith Observatory.\n\nWatch a snippet of the tribute below.", "images": ["http://static.billboard.com/files/media/BB-Recircle-vmas.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/jared-leto-2017-vmas-show-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/jared-leto-2017-vmas-show-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Payne", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/jared-leto-tribute-chris-cornell-chester-bennington-2017-mtv-vmas-7942174/", "title": "Jared Leto Pays Tribute to Chris Cornell & Linkin Park\u2019s Chester Bennington at 2017 MTV VMAs", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Thirty Seconds to Mars arrived at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards ready to play their new single, but first, frontman Jared Leto used the stage to shout out a couple of rock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fallen greats.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Chris Payne", "tags": "vma", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jared Leto Pays Tribute to Chris Cornell & Linkin Park\u2019s Chester Bennington at 2017 MTV VMAs", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/jared-leto-tribute-chris-cornell-chester-bennington-2017-mtv-vmas-7942174/", "description": "Thirty Seconds to Mars arrived at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards ready to play their new single, but first, frontman Jared Leto used the stage to shout out a couple of rock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fallen greats.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/jared-leto-2017-vmas-show-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Jared Leto, 2017 MTV VMAs"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-28T02:23:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-28T07:28:29+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Thirty Seconds to Mars arrived at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards ready to play their new single, but first, frontman Jared Leto used the stage to shout out a couple of rock\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fallen greats.", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jared Leto Pays Tribute to Chris Cornell & Linkin Park\u2019s Chester Bennington at 2017 MTV VMAs", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/jared-leto-2017-vmas-show-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503886995.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
