News, two suspects entered the grounds of their Bel Air mansion early on Friday, with the LA Police Department confirming an attempted motor vehicle theft was made around 5am.\n\nThe LAPD has confirmed that a witness saw one suspect enter and exit a vehicle before fleeing while a second suspect, who was hiding in some bushes, also fled; the LAPD also stated some personal items were taken from the car.\n\nA source has claimed the suspect attempted to flee with a cell phone, but was caught by the property's security team.\n\n\"Nothing of Kim or Kanye's was taken. Their armed security handled it. The guy didn't even make it past the driveway. He was startled by their security, and dropped the phone he was trying to take,\" they explained.\n\nIt's also reported members of the security team drew their guns on the suspect as soon as he entered the bottom of the driveway, meaning the intruder never actually made it to the property, with the burgled car being parked at the bottom of the driveway near the street.\n\n\n\nTMZ reports that the thief then entered the property of comedian Kathy Griffin, who lives next door, where he allegedly broke into a car and stole a purse, which was later ditched.\n\nThe incident comes just over a year after Kardashian was held at gunpoint during a Paris robbery, which led the family to increase security measures, as revealed by Kris Jenner.\n\nFollow Independent Culture on Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and more.", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/21/09/kim-kanye.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/21/09/kim-kanye.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/21/09/kim-kanye.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-attempted-burglary-la-home-cars-stolen-paris-robbery-a8012406.html", "title": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West hit by attempted burglary at LA home", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/music/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "The LAPD\u00a0has confirmed an attempted motor vehicle theft was made on the property early Friday morning", "og": {"updated_time": "2017-10-23T10:53:54.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West hit by attempted burglary", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/news/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-attempted-burglary-la-home-cars-stolen-paris-robbery-a8012406.html", "type": "article", "description": "The LAPD\u00a0has confirmed an attempted motor vehicle theft was made on the property early Friday morning", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/21/09/kim-kanye.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/21/09/kim-kanye.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-23T10:53:54.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-23T10:53:54.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Music", "author_name": "Clarisse Loughrey", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 454, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 2, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 2, "external_link_count": 4}, "date": "2017-10-23T10:53:54.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176832122"}, "twitter": {"title": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West hit by attempted burglary", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The LAPD\u00a0has confirmed an attempted motor vehicle theft was made on the property early Friday morning", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/21/09/kim-kanye.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Kim Kardashian\",\"Kanye West\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508756034.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
