Diddy\u2019s iconic hip-hop label Bad Boy Records, died on Monday. He was 47.\n\nAccording to the New York Daily News, the rapper died of heart failure at his Walterboro, South Carolina home. His death was confirmed by Mack\u2019s former producer Alvin Toney.\n\n\u201cCraig Mack, you were the first artist to release music on Bad Boy and gave us our first hit,\u201d Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs tells Rolling Stone in a statement. \u201cYou always followed your heart and you had an energy that was out of this world. You believed in me and you believed in Bad Boy. I will never forget what you did for hip-hop. You inspired me, and I will continue to try to keep inspiring others. We will always love you.\u201d\n\nMack is best known for the indelible classic \u201cFlava in Ya Ear,\u201d \u2013 a Top 10 hit in 1994 that sold over a million copies \u2013 and its subsequent remix featuring Notorious B.I.G, LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes and Rampage. The original would eventually reach No. 1 on the Billboard rap songs chart and No. 9 on the Hot 100 and earn a Best Rap Solo Performance Grammy nomination. \u201cCraig is hip-hop\u2019s George Clinton, because his stuff is really off the wall,\u201d Diddy once told The New York Times. \u201cHe does what\u2019s from his heart, which is where it starts for him. But his energy comes from somewhere else.\u201d\n\nMack, born in the Bronx in 1970, helped make Bad Boy Records synonymous with New York hip-hop, kickstarting the label that would eventually make stars of Notorious B.I.G., Mase, 112 and more. In a 1995 profile in The New York Times, Mack said he was hooked on rap by his cousins at age nine and began to write his own lyrics at age 12. \u201cI knew I wanted to be like LL Cool J and Run-D.M.C.,\u201d Mack recalled.\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nHe became friendly with members of another famous New York rap group, EPMD, and accompanied them on tour. He did odd jobs for the group and did not perform, but Mack still remembered the experience as a valuable one. \u201cAll the time I was getting an education learning about the studio and the road,\u201d he explained.\n\nMack first started rhyming in the late 1980s. Under the name MC EZ, listed alongside DJ Troup, he released a single 12-inch on Fresh Records in 1988: \u201cJust Rhymin'\u201d b/w \u201cGet Retarded.\u201d The nimble B-side would become a fave among rap fans and was interpolated by Dr. Dre and LL Cool J for the single \u201cZoom.\u201d Mack eventually met Diddy \u2013 who was at that time looking to set up Bad Boy after being fired from Uptown Records \u2013 outside the club Mecca in Manhattan. Mack freestyled for Diddy and earned a record contract.\n\nAfter breaking through with \u201cFlava in Ya Ear\u201d and its accompanying gold-certified album Project: Funk Da World, Mack struggled to replicate his initial success. He left Bad Boy Records and released Operation: Get Down in 1997 but did not score a hit from the album. Mack later appeared in the video for Diddy\u2019s hit \u201cI Need a Girl Part 1,\u201d but his solo career never regained momentum.\n\nMack eventually became a minister in South Carolina and appeared to renounce his former life as a rapper in a 2012 video. The video, taken at the Overcomer Ministry commune in Walterboro, S.C., shows the group\u2019s pastor Ralph Gordon Stair talking to Mack. \u201cCraig Mack is dead,\u201d Stair tells the congregation. \u201cWe have somebody that used to be Craig Mack.\u201d\n\nIn Can\u2019t Stop, Won\u2019t Stop: The Bad Boy Story, the 2017 documentary chronicling the rise of Combs\u2019 revered label and reunion tour, Mack can be heard discussing the possibility of returning to the stage, but declined because of his religious beliefs.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anybody was disappointed,\u201d Combs told Billboard last year. \u201cWe kind of respected his wishes. In this game, man, people don\u2019t realize the music industry only has a one percent rate ratio, so sometimes it\u2019s very stressful and it brings you only to places that you can go to and should go to, which is God. We can respect that because if any of us is still here, we\u2019d have to go to him, too. Sometimes, people can\u2019t walk back and forth in both worlds.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Erick Sermon recruited Mack alongside Method Man and Mr. Cheeks for \u201cCome Thru,\u201d the first single off Sermon\u2019s upcoming album. \u201cI\u2019m devastated over the news of Craig Mack,\u201d Sermon tweeted. \u201cWe just finishing up his new album.\u201d\n\nTrending Stories \u2018Faith Is Under Attack': Nicki Minaj Spreads Misleading Information at the United Nations 2025 CMA Awards: The Complete Winners List Neighbor Indicted in Murder of \u2018King of the Hill\u2019 Star Jonathan Joss Is This Mysterious U.K. Rapper Actually Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet?\n\n\u201cIt was a pleasure to know you & rock with you,\u201d LL Cool J added. \u201cYou $tepped away from the game & did it your way.. I always respected that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am grateful to have worked with him,\u201d Missy Elliott tweeted. \u201cHe was so kind, funny & talented.\u201d\n\nToney, who helped produce Project: Funk Da World, told the NY Daily News he was working on a documentary about Mack. \u201cNobody got to understand his story,\u201d Toney said. \u201cI wanted the world to know the talent he had. It was something I wanted people to enjoy, but it was cut short because he was very religious and wanted to go to church.\u201d\n\nCraig Mack \u2013 \u201cFlava in Ya Ear\u201d\n\n\n\nCraig Mack \u2013 \u201cJockin My Style\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/craig-mack-dead-rapper-founder-bad-boy-records-f209f1f1-97b6-475f-bf48-f57baedd1753.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/craig-mack-dead-rapper-founder-bad-boy-records-f209f1f1-97b6-475f-bf48-f57baedd1753.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elias Leight", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/craig-mack-flava-in-ya-ear-rapper-dead-at-47-127656/", "title": "Craig Mack, \u2018Flava in Ya Ear\u2019 Rapper, Dead at 47", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Craig Mack, the former Bad Boy rapper who found success with \"Flava in Ya Ear,\" has died at the age of 46", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Elias Leight", "tags": "Obituary", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Craig Mack, 'Flava in Ya Ear' Rapper, Dead at 47", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/craig-mack-flava-in-ya-ear-rapper-dead-at-47-127656/", "description": "Craig Mack, the former Bad Boy rapper who found success with \"Flava in Ya Ear,\" has died at the age of 46", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/craig-mack-dead-rapper-founder-bad-boy-records-f209f1f1-97b6-475f-bf48-f57baedd1753.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "width": 1600, "height": 900, "alt": "Craig Mack, 'Flava in Ya Ear' Rapper, Dead at 46"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-13T13:07:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T15:52:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Craig Mack, the former Bad Boy rapper who found success with \"Flava in Ya Ear,\" has died at the age of 46", "site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Craig Mack, \u2018Flava in Ya Ear\u2019 Rapper, Dead at 47", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/craig-mack-dead-rapper-founder-bad-boy-records-f209f1f1-97b6-475f-bf48-f57baedd1753.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/PMbELEUfmIA", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/nk9RaIel9kc", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/dR1IEw-a7Qw", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/GNFqMx0gY7I", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpY_SSrVNzU"], "publish_date": 1520946420.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
