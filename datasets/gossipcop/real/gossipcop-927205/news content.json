We're told she was there to finalize her application for a UK visa.\n\nThe whole thing only took about 10 minutes, and the entire office was cleared for her. We're told she was friendly with the staff. As for her disguise -- shades and a White Sox cap to blend in with locals.\n\nMeghan forked over about $1,500, maybe a little more, for premium processing -- so she should get her visa within a few days ... according to our sources.\n\nBased on the visa application criteria, she most likely submitted for a family visa, and applied as a partner or spouse. That visa requires her to confirm all previous marriages, and her plans to marry or become a civil partner within 6 months of arriving in the UK.\n\nWe can hear her now ... \"Maybe you've heard of my fiance.\"", "images": ["https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/thirtymilezone.svg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/80/16by9/2018/04/12/802b72ec8ac45b04886fc74e09328381_xl.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/78/o/2018/04/12/78d7119ce0ed58c5b4882350df7f15e8_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e3/16by9/2025/11/20/e3028a12684b463faee721ff211e9954_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/0f/16by9/2025/11/20/0fe06478a3e241edaa03423e7f006606_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/de/4by3/2025/11/19/def9d7aac6b04006a89c0cf3fb46eb21_xxs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/f8/16by9/2018/03/08/f8cb7f0935115b979e02d8cf8bbddbd3_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/71/o/2018/04/12/717c016cbe0b5d8aa1abbe0c167313d4_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/b4/16by9/2025/11/20/b4fbe4e8e5654748a5497e1a52b939b1_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e4/16by9/2025/11/20/e4ccda421f7140fb91551c634a62d9dc_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/10/16by9/2018/04/09/1013179571135896bd34b7f27cd39e7a_xs.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/article/google-preferred-source.png", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/72/16by9/2025/11/20/726f88d680674fccaa77ad055cd10d2e_xs.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/80/16by9/2018/04/12/802b72ec8ac45b04886fc74e09328381_xl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2018/04/12/meghan-markle-uk-visa-application/", "title": "Meghan Markle Flies In to Chicago to Complete UK Visa Application", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=0.25,maximum-scale=10", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "google-site-verification": "UUmtbUBf3djgPpCeLefe_PbFsOc6JGxfXmHzpjFLAEQ", "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "p": {"domain_verify": "933e74ace98032aadbc3328616280038"}, "robots": "index,follow,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Meghan Markle was in Chicago Thursday to complete her UK visa application in person.", "fb": {"app_id": 310610065699820}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tmz"}, "og": {"site_name": "TMZ", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.tmz.com/2018/04/12/meghan-markle-uk-visa-application/", "title": "Meghan Markle Flies In to Chicago to Complete UK Visa Application", "description": "Meghan Markle was in Chicago Thursday to complete her UK visa application in person.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/80/16by9/2018/04/12/802b72ec8ac45b04886fc74e09328381_xl.jpg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TMZ", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Meghan Markle Flies In to Chicago to Complete UK Visa Application", "description": "Meghan Markle was in Chicago Thursday to complete her UK visa application in person.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/80/16by9/2018/04/12/802b72ec8ac45b04886fc74e09328381_xl.jpg"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=299948601, app-argument=https://www.tmz.com/2018/04/12/meghan-markle-uk-visa-application/?tmz#article", "application-name": "TMZ.COM", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TMZ.COM", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/msapplication-tile-image-270x270-v1.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.tmz.com/?adid=IE9pin", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#000000", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-tooltip": "TMZ | Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Photos;action-uri=https://www.tmz.com/photos/;icon-uri=https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/favicon-32x32-v1.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523505600.0, "source": "https://www.tmz.com", "summary": ""}
