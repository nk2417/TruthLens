'Brangelina' soon won a legion of fans who heralded their \u201ctrue love\u201d often because they spoke about each other openly, fondly and lovingly.\n\nBelow are some of their most memorable quotes:\n\nAngelina Jolie:\n\n\u201cI think it's a reality of marriage that you go through hard times and that you have to embrace those hard times and challenges and know that it's a part of your marriage and it\u2019s the pulling through together that actually makes the bond.\u201d BBC News, 2015.\n\n\u201c[Brad] has expanded my life in ways I never imagined. We built a family. He is not just the love my life, he is my family. I hold that very dear.\u201d Marie Claire, 2012\n\n'I don't have a lot of friends I talk to. He is really the only person I talk to.\u2019 Marie Claire\n\n\u201cYou get together and you're two individuals and you feel inspired by each other, you challenge each other, you complement each other, drive each other beautifully crazy.\u201d Elle, 2014\n\nBrad Pitt:\n\n\u201cThere's a more profound feeling when I look back at all the things my wife and I have gone through; all the successes and failures and great passions and great fights and that we have that together is something I can\u2019t quite get my arms around but, to me, it\u2019s much more enticing than the newness of relationships.\u201d BBC News, 2015\n\n\u2018We know each other so well, just one gaze from her and I know, I f***d up this scene.\u201d Glamour Germany\n\n\u2018There are no secrets at our house. We tell the kids, 'Mom and Dad are going off to kiss.' They go, 'Eww, gross!' But we demand it.\u201d USA Weekend, 2011\n\n\u201cOne of the greatest, smartest things I ever did was give my kids Angie as their mom.\u201d Parade, 2011\n\n\u201cI get up some mornings and gasp,\u201d E!
