Cozy greens, velvets, and plaids), but we\u2019re here to read into Kate\u2019s body language. Because apparently there are things! to! analyze!\n\nAccording to body language expert Judi James, the Princess of Wales\u2014who completed chemotherapy back in September\u2014was \u201cupbeat\u201d and \u201cconfident.\u201d\n\nMark Cuthbert // Getty Images\n\n\u201cKate\u2019s outfit looked significant in terms of her recovery, not because of the earthy country-green shade, which toned with the other top-tier royals, creating a message of unity and team bonding, but because of her hat, which was a small green beret/fascinator,\u201d Judi explained. \u201cKate arrived at church walking crowd-side and had she worn a wide-brimmed hat as she has in the past, there would have been an option of partly hiding her face if she felt vulnerable. A smaller hat like hers tends to signal strength and a more confident, upbeat approach, and that was reflected in her beaming smile as she passed the fans.\u201d\n\nSamir Hussein // Getty Images\n\nJudi also noticed a sweet moment between Kate and William, remarking that the \u201cdimpling\u201d in Kate\u2019s smile \u201csuggests authentic joy and good humor and as William looked across and saw it, his own smile seemed to widen, to match those of their very Christmas Day\u2013excited children.\u201d\n\n\n\nI mean, cute.
