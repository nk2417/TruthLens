David,\u201d in their roles as David Healy and Darlene Conner. The revival season has already established that they have two kids, Harris and Mark, but have split since. Darlene returned home to raise her kids with the help of Roseanne and Dan at the start of the new season.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\nIn a sneak peek of the episode, Darlene says, \u201cI\u2019ve heard it before, David. You miss me, you want to get back together, then as soon as things get real you run back to Deadbeats Without Borders.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot this time,\u201d David says \u2014 and he means it, telling Darlene that he had just signed a lease in Lanford.\n\nBut Darlene\u2019s happiness lasted all of about five seconds.\n\n\u201cI realized it\u2019s not too late to fix things,\u201d David says before dropping another bomb: \u201cI met someone.\u201d\n\nHe goes on to reveal that his new love interest\u2019s name is Blue and that he\u2019s \u201clearned so much from her.\u201d\n\nA perturbed Darlene interrupts his speech and blasts him, \u201cWait, so we\u2019re just gonna blow right past the whole Blue thing?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was hoping to,\u201d David says before the clip ends.\n\nIn a different trailer for Thursday\u2019s episode, we see David peek his head through Darlene\u2019s window before having a face-to-face with John Goodman\u2019s Dan.\n\nThe synopsis for the episode reads, \u201cDavid unexpectedly shows up for Harris\u2019 birthday after being absent for years, forcing Darlene to re-examine their relationship and the rest of the family. Meanwhile, Roseanne and Jackie\u2019s mother, Bev, temporarily moves into the Conner home after an incident at the nursing home prevents her from returning.\u201d\n\nDavid has been noticeably absent from the show ever since its return, despite being married to Darlene at the end of the show\u2019s original run in 1997 (ignoring the show\u2019s series finale).\n\nSo far through the first four episodes, there\u2019s been plenty of drama involving Harris and Mark. It was revealed early on in the show that Mark is gender fluid, as he enjoys occasionally wearing makeup and girl\u2019s clothes.\n\nMeanwhile Harris was caught during a recent episode selling stolen items on Etsy in an attempt to move back to Chicago. While Darlene is sympathetic over her daughter\u2019s unhappiness, she still punishes her by demanding the passwords to all of her social media accounts and grounding her.\n\nFans shouldn\u2019t get too comfortable with David; \u201cDarlene v. David\u201d is the only episode on the revival season where Galecki\u2019s character will appear, as his Big Bang Theory schedule conflicts with the filming of Roseanne.", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/zach-bryan.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": [".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/tv-shows/news/johnny-galecki-returns-roseanne-david-healy-potential-bad-news/", "title": "\u2018Roseanne\u2019: Johnny Galecki Returns With Big News", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Roseanne': Johnny Galecki Returns With Big News", "description": "In one of the moments Roseanne fans have been waiting for, Johnny Galecki is returning to the Conner household as David Healy \u2014 but he might be the bearer of bad news.
