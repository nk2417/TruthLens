That\u2019s something that\u2019s also not discussed, necessarily \u2014 that our getting equal pay is going to require people to selflessly say, \u2018That\u2019s what\u2019s fair.\u2019 If my male co-star, who has a higher quote than me but believes we are equal, takes a pay cut so that I can match him, that changes my quote in the future and changes my life.\u201d\n\nRiseborough and Stone star in the upcoming film \u201cBattle of the Sexes,\u201d based on the legendary 1973 tennis match between King and Bobby Riggs (played by Steve Carell). King has been a supporter of women\u2019s equality throughout her career, earning her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In the interview, the three women also discussed how the themes of the film are still relevant today \u2014 including the current administration.\n\n\u201cThe parallels in this movie are pretty fascinating,\u201d added Stone. \u201cWe began shooting in the spring of 2016, when there was still a lot of hope in the air, and it was very interesting to see this guy\u2013this narcissistic, self-focused, constantly-stirring-the-pot kind of guy\u2013against this incredible, qualified woman, and at the same time me playing Billie Jean, with Steve [Carell] playing Bobby Riggs. Obviously the way this has all panned out has been fascinating and horrifying, and it still feels like we\u2019re in a bad dream, but those parallels make sense to me\u2013the equal-pay issue makes a lot of sense to me. At our best right right now we\u2019re making 80 cents to the dollar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhite women,\u201d King chimed in. \u201cIf you\u2019re African American or Hispanic it goes down, and then Asian Americans make 90 cents to the dollar.\u201d\n\nStone added, \u201cIt\u2019s not about, \u2018Women are this and men are that.\u2019 It is, \u2018We are all the same, we are all equal, we all deserve the same respect and the same rights.\u2019 And that\u2019s really what I\u2019ve been so grateful for with male co-stars\u2013when I\u2019ve been in a similar-size role in films, and it\u2019s been multiple people who have been really incredible and said, \u2018That\u2019s what I want to do. That\u2019s what\u2019s fair and what\u2019s right.\u2019\u201d\n\nRisenborough revealed that she asked for a raise \u201csix weeks ago, to no avail,\u201d adding that the pay disparity is the worst in the United States. And she explained that her entire life has been watching men stick up for each other while women haven\u2019t been \u201csocialized\u201d in the same way, but rather, are sexualized.\n\n\u201cWomen are seriously, highly sexualized. Just look at the \u2018Baywatch\u2019 posters,\u201d Risenborough said. \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting and degrading, and it\u2019s pulling female emancipation kicking and screaming back 500 years. It is so important to think about what happened before, and there was a lot of strength before. Cleopatra was quite a long time ago, but Hillary didn\u2019t get in. There\u2019s a journey here, and it\u2019s about, as Billie says, uniting.\u201d\n\nRead the entire Out Magazine article here. \u201cBattle of the Sexes\u201d opens Sept. 22.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/emma-stone-aloha-miscast-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?resize=150%2C150&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/5x4_082025_COVER_B.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?fit=53%2C58&quality=80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/emma-stone-aloha-miscast-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Film Editor", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/emma-stone-says-male-co-stars-took-pay-cuts-because-we-are-all-equal/", "title": "Emma Stone Says Her Male Co-Stars Have Taken Pay Cuts Because \u2018We Are All Equal\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Emma Stone Says Her Male Co-Stars Have Taken Pay Cuts Because 'We Are All Equal'", "description": "\"That's something they do for me because they feel it's what's right and fair,\" actress says", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/emma-stone-says-male-co-stars-took-pay-cuts-because-we-are-all-equal/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/emma-stone-aloha-miscast-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2017-07-07T14:54:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-07T17:59:02+00:00"}, "author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "andrea_riseborough, battle-of-the-sexes, billie-jean, billie-jean-king, bobby-riggs, emma_stone, steve_carell", "article-section": "news", "article-categories": "movies, news", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499439284.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
