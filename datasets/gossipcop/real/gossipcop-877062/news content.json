Eagle-eyed fans spotted all sorts of butterfly references in the 11-minute long announcement video, and it all seemed very plausible.\n\n\n\nYouTube/ELLE There were all sorts of butterflies featured in the video\n\nExcept, the theory was actually pretty flawed. Because Kylie Jenner hates butterflies, it turns out. And fans who watched Life of Kylie might remember the episode that proves it.\n\nWhen Kylie, Victoria and Jordyn took a trip to the London Zoo, they stopped off for a visit at the butterfly exhibit. But it quickly became clear that Kylie was scared shitless of butterflies.\n\n\"It's kind of ironic because I'm terrified...terrified of butterflies,\" she told the camera later. \"This is how I think of them: cut the wings off and if you just look at their bodies, it's not that pretty.\"\n\nYeah, so that Butterfly/Mariposa name theory wasn't quite as on the mark as we first thought. But we've got Stormi instead, and that's pretty damn cute.\n\nFollow Cat on Instagram.", "images":
