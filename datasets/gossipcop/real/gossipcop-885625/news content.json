We will never forget. #vegasstrong\"\n\nThe wife of the country star, who is pregnant with the couple's first child, opened up last week about the terrifying incident and the moment the gunman opened fire during Aldean's performance at the Route 91 Harvest Country Music Festival.\n\n\"When the gunfire started, I was not with Jason, but with some friends in a tent close to Mandalay,\" she wrote on Instagram. \"As you can imagine my first instinct was to run to him and his was the same. As we laid behind equipment onstage with some of our road family, bullets flying past... all I could think was 'I never even got to hold my baby.'\"\n\n\"We all made sure the others knew we loved them and then ran for cover where we stayed for the next couple hours. (Not knowing if there were multiple shooters, where the bullets were coming from... NOTHING),\" Brittany continued. \"We were the lucky ones. I can't put into words the pain and heartache we feel for the ones who are no longer with us.\"\n\nAldean has canceled multiple shows following the tragedy in Las Vegas, but did open this week's Saturday Night Live with a surprise performance of the late Tom Petty's \"I Won't Back Down,\" in a tribute to both the musical icon, who died on Monday at the age of 66, and the victims in Las Vegas.\n\n\"So many people are hurting... Children, brothers, sisters, parents -- they're all part of our family,\" Aldean said before the performance. \"We're gonna work through these tough times together, all the way.\"\n\nFor more on his appearance, watch the video below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-10/brittany_jason_aldean_gettyimages-838060460.jpg?h=d29a8858&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/jason_aldean_shooting_gettyimages_856483180.jpg?h=c146e78c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-10/jason_aldean_shooting_gettyimages_856483180.jpg?h=c146e78c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-10/jason_aldean_katy_perry_keith_urban_getty_0.jpg?h=ddd0da6f&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2023-12/MK-Lala-Anthony-1920-x-800-GALLERY-HERO.jpg?h=243f4c1e&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/jason_aldean_shooting_gettyimages_856483180.jpg?h=c146e78c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/jason-aldean-and-wife-brittany-return-las-vegas-visit-shooting-victims-we-will-never-forget-88814", "title": "Jason Aldean and Wife Brittany Return to Las Vegas to Visit Shooting Victims: 'We Will Never Forget'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/jason_aldean_shooting_gettyimages_856483180.jpg?h=c146e78c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The country singer and his wife returned to the city one week after the horrific shooting that occurred while he was on stage.", "title": "Jason Aldean and Wife Brittany Return to Las Vegas to Visit Shooting Victims: 'We Will Never Forget'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jason-aldean-and-wife-brittany-return-las-vegas-visit-shooting-victims-we-will-never-forget-88814", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The country singer and his wife returned to the city one week after the horrific shooting that occurred while he was on stage.", "twitter": {"description": "The country singer and his wife returned to the city one week after the horrific shooting that occurred while he was on stage.", "title": "Jason Aldean and Wife Brittany Return to Las Vegas to Visit Shooting Victims: 'We Will Never Forget'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jason-aldean-and-wife-brittany-return-las-vegas-visit-shooting-victims-we-will-never-forget-88814", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/jason_aldean_shooting_gettyimages_856483180.jpg?h=c146e78c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Jason Aldean and Wife Brittany Return to Las Vegas to Visit Shooting Victims: 'We Will Never Forget' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Jason Aldean", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
