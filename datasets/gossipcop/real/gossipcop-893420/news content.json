I was a teenager and reckless in my behavior. I know Daniel to be a trustworthy and honest person, and to find out through social media that I was not the friend I thought I was to him made me so sad.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI am so mortified by this behavior and have contacted Daniel and apologized to him privately. I am not and never have been homophobic. I have nothing but love for the LGBTQ community and Daniel.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Franzese took to Facebook to share his experience with on-set homophobia and abusive behavior in light of Ellen Page coming forward to tell her experience with Brett Ratner on the set of the \u201cX-Men\u201d movies.\n\n\u201cOn my first film BULLY I was harassed by Bijou Phillips the entire shoot,\u201d he wrote. \u201cShe body shamed me and ridiculed me about my sexuality\u202c and physically assaulted me.\u201d\n\nFranzese said that the actress would loudly say, \u201cAre you gay?\u201d although he was still closeted at the time. The actor added that when he told her he was bi, she would say, \u201cOh look! The Bi guy is here!\u201d\n\n\u201cLater on in the production I had a scene where my character had to take his shirt off,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was an extremely vulnerable moment for me because I was not at all the type of guy comfortable with taking my clothes off in front of anyone at that point in my life. I was the chubby kid who wore his shirt in the pool. So I take my shirt off in the scene and she breaks character and she pointed at my body and at the top of her lungs yelled \u2018Ewwww gross!!!\u2019 She laughed and pointed at me and continued to berate me. they call cut and I had to walk off set to collect myself.\u201d\n\nOn another occasion, Franzese said Phillips \u201cgrabbed my nipple and twisted it hard through my shirt and laughed and walked away.\u201d She also once wiped her dirty feet on Franzese\u2019s neck, he wrote.\n\n\u201cIt was such a blessing to get a foot into Hollywood\u2019s door but I was greeted at that door with homophobia, body shaming and abuse,\u201d he concluded. \u201cThe way I was treated in that hostile work environment gave me a PTSD that had me stay closeted for a long time.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Franzese has not yet responded to TheWrap\u2019s request for comment, although he tweeted that he forgave Phillips and accepted her apology.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been hurt and we\u2019ve all hurt someone,\u201d he wrote to Phillips. \u201cI accept your apology on the grace you can afford the same mercy to someone else one day.\n\nThread: I forgive @BijouPhillips because I don\u2019t know her private story either. I shared this story only to bring light to a dark memory. \u2014 Daniel Franzese (@WhatsupDanny) November 13, 2017\n\nIt was 18years ago. She has sent me an apology I accept. It would be nice to see her make a donation to @TrevorProject or something. \u2014 Daniel Franzese (@WhatsupDanny) November 13, 2017\n\nWe\u2019ve all been hurt and we\u2019ve all hurt someone. I\ufe0f accept your apology on the grace you can afford the same mercy to someone else one day. \u2014 Daniel Franzese (@WhatsupDanny) November 13, 2017\n\nRead Franzese\u2019s Facebook post below.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325_COVER-_IR_5x4.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?resize=150%2C150&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DanielBijou.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?fit=53%2C58&quality=80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DanielBijou.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Film Editor", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/bijou-phillips-apologizes-for-gay-shaming-mean-girls-actor-daniel-franzese/", "title": "Bijou Phillips Apologizes for Gay-Shaming \u2018Mean Girls\u2019 Actor Daniel Franzese", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bijou Phillips Apologizes for Gay-Shaming 'Mean Girls' Actor Daniel Franzese", "description": "\"I am not and never have been homophobic,\" actress says. \"I have nothing but love for the LGBTQ community and Daniel\"", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/bijou-phillips-apologizes-for-gay-shaming-mean-girls-actor-daniel-franzese/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DanielBijou.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2017-11-13T15:42:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-13T17:43:16+00:00"}, "author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "bijou-phillips, brett_ratner, daniel-franzese, ellen_page, nick-stahl", "article-section": "movies", "article-categories": "movies", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510587775.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
