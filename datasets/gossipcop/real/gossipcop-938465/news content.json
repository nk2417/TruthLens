But Munn now says Rodgers had already gone eight months without speaking to his parents or one of his brothers by the time she started dating him.\n\n\u201cI remember my last day on \u2018The Newsroom\u2019 \u2026 I spent the day in my trailer just encouraging him to have an honest conversation with (his) parents, and we just kind of (did) bullet point stuff,\u201d Munn said Wednesday on Andy Cohen\u2019s SiriusXM radio show.\n\nOlivia Munn says she attempted to help her ex-boyfriend Aaron Rodgers get back on good terms with his parents.\n\n\u201cThey had a really nice conversation, and then they started coming out my first year when I was in Green Bay in 2014, and then it just (went downhill),\u201d she said.\n\nMunn, 37, says she only saw Rodgers\u2019 parents a few times during their three-year relationship, which ended last year. She says she also met his brother Jordan, who competed on \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d in 2016 and revealed on the show that his brother wasn\u2019t on good terms with their family.\n\nRodgers\u2019 father Ed later confirmed in early 2017 that he wasn\u2019t on speaking terms with the two-time NFL MVP.\n\n\u201cFame can change things,\u201d Ed told The New York Times.\n\nMunn is \u201cnot really\u201d on speaking terms with Rodgers anymore.\n\nHis father\u2019s comments garnered considerable attention, but Rodgers, 34, and Munn remained mostly tight-lipped on the matter. A source told Us Weekly at the time that Rodgers\u2019 family \u201cdidn\u2019t trust\u201d Munn. She and Rodgers broke up several months later.\n\nMunn said Wednesday she believes fame can lead to challenges for families, especially in situations like Rodgers\u2019 where several of his family members are also attempting to have professional success in the sports world. Rodgers\u2019 father is a sports chiropractor, while Jordan played college football and is currently an analyst for ESPN\u2019s SEC Network.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day there is a lot of complications,\u201d Munn said. \u201cI don\u2019t think either side of the road is clean, but I do think it\u2019s not OK when you try to stand on someone\u2019s shoulders and then throw dirt in their face, which is what I think they did with him.\u201d\n\nMunn said she\u2019s \u201cnot really\u201d on speaking terms with Rodgers, who has since begun a relationship with Danica Patrick.", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/05/23/CBH7SE7WLZF664N274EUWUPWOA.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/05/23/CBH7SE7WLZF664N274EUWUPWOA.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Sblendorio"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/05/23/olivia-munn-says-aaron-rodgers-was-estranged-from-family-before-they-started-dating/", "title": "Olivia Munn says Aaron Rodgers was estranged from family before they started dating", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Peter Sblendorio", "canonical": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/05/23/olivia-munn-says-aaron-rodgers-was-estranged-from-family-before-they-started-dating/"}, "description": "The actress finally shed some light on her ex-boyfriend's strained relationship with his family.", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Olivia Munn says Aaron Rodgers was estranged from family before they started dating", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/05/23/olivia-munn-says-aaron-rodgers-was-estranged-from-family-before-they-started-dating/", "description": "Olivia Munn finally shed some light on her ex-boyfriend Aaron Rodgers\u2019 strained relationship with his family.
