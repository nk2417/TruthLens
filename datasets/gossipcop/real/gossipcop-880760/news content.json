Like a mob of Black Friday shoppers, zombies from the movie \u201cWorld War Z\u201d and a mass of crabs scrambling around on a beach.\n\nMcKinnon\u2019s Ingraham also paused frequently to thank her few remaining sponsors, which included a sister product of My Pillow called \u201cMy Hemorrhoids Donut.\u201d\n\nOne of the best gags was probably Thompson as Clarke playing up conspiracy theories about voter fraud by declaring: \u201cIf these immigrants walk at a normal pace of 300 miles a day, they could be here in time to vote on election day!\u201d\n\nMcKinnon\u2019s Ingraham also provided a few tips for those who are going out to vote in the midterm elections next week, such as never vote on Tuesdays\u201d and \u201cyou already voted.\u201d\n\nAnd as for Baldwin, the sketch ended with a jab at \u201cdisgraced former actor Alec Baldwin, seen here molesting a young Boy Ccout.\u201d At which point \u201cSNL\u201d displayed an image of a shirtless Baldwin with Adam Sandler dressed in a Boy Scout costume from an old sketch.\n\nYou can watch the sketch in the video embedded at the top of this post.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5x4_082025_COVER.jpg?fit=240%2C300&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/snl-saturday-night-live-kate-mckinnon-laura-ingraham-midterms-migrant-caravan-fearmongering.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/snl-saturday-night-live-kate-mckinnon-laura-ingraham-midterms-migrant-caravan-fearmongering.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Phil Owen", "Phil.Owen Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/snl-kate-mckinnons-laura-ingraham-reminds-you-not-to-vote-mocks-alec-baldwin/", "title": "\u2018SNL\u2019: Kate McKinnon\u2019s Laura Ingraham Reminds You Not to Vote, Mocks Alec Baldwin (Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'SNL': Kate McKinnon's Laura Ingraham Reminds You Not to Vote, Mocks Alec Baldwin (Video)", "description": "McKinnon's Ingraham and guests Judge Jeanine and David Clarke also try to terrify you with fake footage of the immigrant caravan", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/snl-kate-mckinnons-laura-ingraham-reminds-you-not-to-vote-mocks-alec-baldwin/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/snl-saturday-night-live-kate-mckinnon-laura-ingraham-midterms-migrant-caravan-fearmongering.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2018-11-04T04:00:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-04T07:07:45+00:00"}, "author": "Phil Owen", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Phil Owen", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "alec_baldwin, cecily_strong, david-clarke, donald-trump, judge-jeanine, kate_mckinnon, kenan_thompson, laura_ingraham, saturday-night-live, snl", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "culture, media, news, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1541304027.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
