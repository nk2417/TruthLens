I think that I am still actually processing,' she explained.\n\nStephane Cardinale - Corbis // Getty Images\n\n'I feel like I got gangbanged by the f*cking planet. There was not one person in the world that is not capable of seeing these intimate photos of me.'\n\n'You could just be at a barbecue and someone could just pull it up on their phone.'\n\nThe Hunger Games star revealed that several women had contacted her about bringing a lawsuit against technology company Apple which later revealed hackers hadn't penetrated its systems, as was widely believed, rather targeted 'names, passwords and security questions'.\n\nI think that I am still actually processing\n\nDespite the leak, the star decided not to sue the tech giant.\n\n'None of that was going to bring me peace and none of that was going to bring my nude body back to me and Nick [Holt], the person they were intended for,' she explained. The Oscar winner is believed to have since married art gallery director Cooke Maroney, on October 19, 2019, at a Rhode Island venue.\n\nGetty Images Jennifer Lawrence and then-boyfriend Nicholas Holt | ELLE UK\n\nDuring the interview, Lawrence recalled a time when someone came up to her following the incident and described her as a role model for young women, forcing her to run to the toilets and burst into tears.\n\n'I feel like I got gangbanged by the f*cking planet\n\n'I felt like an impostor or I felt like I can't believe someone still feels that way,' she admitted.\n\nTouching on the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault and harassment scandal which came to light a month prior, the star described the film producer as a 'paternal' figure in her career.\n\nGetty Images\n\n'Then with Harvey Weinstein, it was bizarre. I heard that he was a dog but he was always almost paternal to me,' she shared.\n\n'He was never inappropriate with me. I thought we had a nice relationship where when he acted like an asshole, I called him an asshole. I actually think the word I used was a sadistic monster, but it was just never of that nature so that was really shocking.'\n\nWhen he acted like an asshole, I called him an asshole\n\nWhile several A-listers including the likes of Rose McGowan, Gwyneth Paltrow, Natalie Portman and Angelina Jolie have spoken up about the sexual misconduct they've endured during their careers, the Californian star admitted: 'I have never had a man use his power to sexually abuse me.'\n\nFeeling sexually violated\n\nIn an interview with Oprah Winfrey for The Hollywood Reporter in December 2017, the star said that the hack made her \u2018afraid\u2019 of going nude in a film.\n\n\u2018I just thought, \u201cI'll never do that again. I'll never share that part of myself ever since it got shared against my will\u201d,\u2019 she told the presenter.\n\nThe Passengers actress added that she would rather have been burgled than having photos of her nude body shared online.\n\nJamie McCarthy // Getty Images\n\n\u2018I would much prefer my whole house to have been invaded,\u2019 she admitted.\n\n\u2018That's what's so scary about electronic (things). I have such fear with my phone and my computer and electronics.\n\nI would much prefer my whole house to have been invaded\n\n\u2018It's taking somebody's intellectual property but also my body.\n\n\u2018It was violating on a sexual level.\u2019\n\nGoing nude on camera for the first time\n\nIn March 2018, the actress defended her decision to do a nude scene in her spy film, Red Sparrow, in which she plays a Russian ballerina-turned assassin. The film marked the first time the star went nude for a role and was admittedly something she says \u2018scared the hell\u2019 out of her.\n\n\u2018I tried to do the movie without nudity but realised it just wouldn\u2019t be right to put the character through something that I, myself, am not willing to go through,\u2019 Lawrence told Vanity Fair.\n\n'My biggest fear was that people would say, \u201cOh, how can you complain about the hack if you\u2019re going to get nude anyway?\u201d\u2019 Lawrence added.\n\nThe 30-year-old explained that it was her decision to go nude \u2013 no one else\u2019s. \u2018I got something back that was taken from me, and it also felt normal,\u2019 she explained.\n\nLawrence continued, stating that working with the film\u2019s director Francis Lawrence, with whom she filmed the Hunger Games franchise, helped her feel at ease on set during some of the more uncomfortable moments while nude on the set of the spy film.\n\n\u2018He looked me right in the eyes like I had clothes on and then all of a sudden I was like, \u201cOh, okay it\u2019s just like I have clothes on\u201d,\u2019 she told the magazine. \u2018Everybody here is professional. You\u2019re still at work. One look just made me comfortable. It didn\u2019t make me feel naked.\u2019\n\nThe same month, Lawrence told Ellen DeGeneres, on her talk show in 2018, of her decision to go nude in the film: \u2018I just didn\u2019t want to miss out on it because of my weird insecurities.'\n\nAt the New York premiere of the film in February 2018, the actress told Variety: \u2018The insecurity and fear of being judged for getting nude, what I went through, should that dictate decisions I make for the rest of my life?\n\n\u2018This movie changed that and I didn\u2019t even realise how important changing that mentality was until it was done.\u2019\n\nSeven years later, Lawrence is still traumatised\n\nIn her first major interview in years, after taking a step back from public life to cultivate a more private existence with husband Cooke Maroney, Jennifer Lawrence gives her first major interview to Vanity Fair, in November 2021.\n\nIn the sit down chat, the actor addresses the nude photo hacking scandal once again and it seems, though she's made peace with herself after the incident, she feels that the trauma will last a lifetime.\n\n'Anybody can go look at my naked body without my consent, any time of the day,' she says. 'Somebody in France just published them. My trauma will exist forever.'", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/grace-gibbons-wild-cherry-cast-69173263a1ac7.jpeg?crop=0.564xw:1.00xh;0.220xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/47/1511258692-gettyimages-161028827.jpg?resize=980:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/blackdoves-episodicimagery-image-12-67535b1b2941f.jpg?crop=0.563xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/watson-tv-series-69170c765425a.png?crop=0.559xw:1.00xh;0.280xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1176776217.jpg?resize=980:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1153106672.jpg?resize=980:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wild-cherry-bbc-6917257d38869.jpg?crop=0.5625xw:1xh;center,top&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/573af0d3-3300-404a-99cb-6bb732fa222c_1723539142.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/16/24/1600x800/landscape-1465854559-jenifer-lawrence-wedding.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1153778824.jpg?crop=0.900xw:0.676xh;0.100xw,0.112xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/claire-danes-the-beast-inme-69171e784b6b9.jpeg?crop=0.643xw:0.964xh;0.0641xw,0.0361xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/logo.2856426.svg?primary=navLogoColor", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/2023-elle-nepo-babies-thumb-1-649c435073378.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/malice-tv-show-691c5e27ca583.png?crop=0.557315233785822xw:1xh;center,top&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-beast-in-me-claire-danes-cast-68f64ce283d4a.jpeg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-beast-in-me-claire-danes-matthew-rhys-68f639e0c564e.jpeg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.236xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1132279454.jpg?resize=980:*", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/x.3361b6d.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/olivia-coleman-the-night-manager-6914beee6686f.jpeg?crop=0.630xw:0.950xh;0.370xw,0.0337xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1153778824.jpg?crop=0.827xw:0.893xh;0.168xw,0.0816xh&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/47/1511258616-gettyimages-145285736.jpg?resize=980:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-bay-mystery-thriller-69174ef17e908.png?crop=0.998xw:1.00xh;0.00160xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-beast-in-me-claire-danes-matthew-rhys-68f639e0c564e.jpeg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/en-gb/static/images/logos/network-logo.eae65ae.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/images/logos/ipso-regulated.4f346f9.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-513018622-1569320312.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.718xh;0,0.0229xh&resize=300:*", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/close.38e3324.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fool-me-once-thriller-min-6914a47a6a568.jpg?crop=0.6653439153439153xw:1xh;center,top&resize=360:*", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/search.f1c199c.svg"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1153778824.jpg?crop=0.900xw:0.676xh;0.100xw,0.112xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a40104/jennifer-lawrence-why-she-didnt-sue-nude-photo-leak-scandal/", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence -
