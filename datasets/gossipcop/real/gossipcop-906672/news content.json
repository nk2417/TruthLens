Fuji. Paul took down the clip a day later, after it had already garnered at least 6 million views. He issued an apology, followed by a second apology, in the aftermath.\n\nPaul added to the TMZ cameraman he\u2019s learned \u201ceverything, so many things\u201d from the fallout.\n\nAdding to the public skewering he received, YouTube told TheWrap last week Paul would be pulled from starring on the platform\u2019s original series \u201cFoursome.\u201d Upcoming YouTube projects have been put on hold, and Paul was stripped of his Google Preferred status, which helps advertisers identify top content and purchase easy-to-buy ad packages.\n\nPaul didn\u2019t have much to say about YouTube to TMZ. He nodded when asked if he\u2019d been treated fairly by the video giant and the public, and said he has a message \u201ccoming\u201d regarding YouTube\u2019s decision.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sean-Burch.png?resize=150%2C150&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325_COVER-_IR_5x4.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Sean-Burch.png?fit=53%2C58&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/logan-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/logan-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sean Burch", "Sean Is A Business Reporter Who Covers Tech", "Media For Thewrap Based In New York City.
