Their shows attracted a huge following in Hollywood, with stars like Britney Spears, Pink and Brittany Murphy joining them on stage.\n\nIn 2003, Antin decided to reinvent the troupe as a pop group, and held open auditions to find new singers and dancers.\n\nKaya Jones joined the band at this point, but had left by the time they released their debut single, Don't Cha, in 2005 and does not appear on any of their recorded output.\n\nThe Pussycat Dolls in 2008 (L-R): Melody Thornton, Kimberley Wyatt, Nicole Scherzinger, Ashley Roberts and Jessica Sutta\n\nSpeaking to The Blast on Monday, Antin called Jones's accusations \"disgusting, ridiculous lies\" and claimed the singer was \"clearly looking for her 15 minutes\".\n\nJones responded by warning the media not to \"discredit the victim\" by reporting Antin's denials, describing her as a \"predator\".\n\n\"You don't have to believe me,\" she added. \"I lived it.\n\n\"It's now about helping other people in the world scared to stand up to their abusers.\"", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/13FE0/production/_86288818_bbcmusic_logo_use.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F5A7/production/_98378826_55bbb0b3-c322-44aa-82d3-d494b87b4972.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/CE97/production/_98378825_55bbb0b3-c322-44aa-82d3-d494b87b4972.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3257/production/_98378821_6fdffac8-5c2c-42b8-9525-29e6840714e0.jpg.webp", "https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8077/production/_98378823_e9aad4cd-10ae-4217-8b10-59540d0b76ad.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/17BE/production/_92787060_line2.gif.webp"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F5A7/production/_98378826_55bbb0b3-c322-44aa-82d3-d494b87b4972.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41678697", "title": "Pussycat Dolls deny prostitution claims", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "page.section": "Culture", "page.subsection": "Entertainment_and_arts", "og": {"title": "Pussycat Dolls deny prostitution claims", "description": "The pop band respond to former member Kaya Jones, who claims the group was a \"prostitution ring\".", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F5A7/production/_98378826_55bbb0b3-c322-44aa-82d3-d494b87b4972.jpg", "alt": "The Pussycat Dolls"}}, "twitter": {"title": "Pussycat Dolls deny prostitution claims", "description": "The pop band respond to former member Kaya Jones, who claims the group was a \"prostitution ring\".", "image": {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F5A7/production/_98378826_55bbb0b3-c322-44aa-82d3-d494b87b4972.jpg", "alt": "The Pussycat Dolls"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The pop band respond to former member Kaya Jones, who claims the group was a \"prostitution ring\".", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364147881, app-argument=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41678697", "version": "web-2.33.2-3", "al": {"ios": {"url": "bbcx://news/entertainment-arts-41678697", "app_store_id": 364147881, "app_name": "BBC: World News & Stories"}, "android": {"url": "bbcx://news/entertainment-arts-41678697", "app_name": "BBC: World News & Stories", "package": "bbc.mobile.news.ww"}, "web": {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41678697"}}, "cXenseParse": {"pageclass": "article", "publishtime": "2017-10-19T11:13:59.000Z", "author": "Mark Savage"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2017-10-19T11:13:59.000Z"}, "next-head-count": 42}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.bbc.com", "summary": ""}
