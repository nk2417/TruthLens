Backstage at the 2018 Grammys, he elaborated on his decision.\n\n\u201cI stand by that. I\u2019m really appreciative of this. I\u2019m making another project right now,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I like endings, I think they\u2019re important to progress.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI think if a lot of things had death clauses in them, we wouldn\u2019t have a lot of problems in the world, to be honest. I think ending are good because they force things to get better.\u201d\n\nGlover scored one win at the Grammys for best traditional R&B performance for \u201cRedbone.\u201d His album, \u201cAwaken, My Love,\u201d was nominated for both album and urban contemporary album of the year, while \u201cRedbone\u201d was nominated for record of the year and best R&B song.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nHe performed \u201cTerrified,\u201d along with 9-year-old J.D. McCrary during the 60th annual show. The two are starring alongside each other in the live-action remake of \u201cThe Lion King,\u201d where Glover is set to portray Simba and McCrary as young Simba.\n\nIn September, Glover took home an Emmy for acting and directing for his acclaimed FX show \u201cAtlanta.\u201d", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/childish-gambino.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://source.unsplash.com/random/595x333", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/childish-gambino.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Rubin", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/donald-glover-retiring-childish-gambino-grammys-1202679904/", "title": "Donald Glover Confirms He\u2019s Definitely Retiring Childish Gambino", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "At the Grammys, Donald Glover confirmed he's retiring Childish Gambino.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Rebecca Rubin", "tags": "Childish Gambino, Donald Glover, Grammy Awards", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Donald Glover Confirms He\u2019s Definitely Retiring Childish Gambino", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/donald-glover-retiring-childish-gambino-grammys-1202679904/", "description": "At the Grammys, Donald Glover confirmed he's retiring Childish Gambino.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/childish-gambino.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Grammys: Donald Glover Confirms He's Retiring Childish Gambino"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-29T05:24:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-29T07:41:14+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "At the Grammys, Donald Glover confirmed he's retiring Childish Gambino.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@rebeccaarubin", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Donald Glover Confirms He\u2019s Definitely Retiring Childish Gambino", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/childish-gambino.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517203485.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
