Gomez, who, along with her mom, pushed for the series to be made, served as an executive producer on the show.\n\n\u201cI would do anything to be able to have a good influence on this generation, but I definitely relate to everything that was going on,\u201d said the 24-year-old during a Netflix press event in February. \u201cI was there for the last episode, and I was a mess just seeing it all come to life, because I\u2019ve experienced that.\u201d\n\nNow, the story is getting even more personal for Gomez. Along with two of the show\u2019s breakout stars, Tommy Dorfman (who plays Ryan Shaver) and Alisha Boe (Jessica Davis), the pop star got a semicolon tattoo over the weekend to represent Project Semicolon, a suicide prevention and mental health awareness organization. The symbolic punctuation represents the idea that when one thought ends, a new one begins \u2014 that \u201cthis is not the end but a new beginning.\u201d\n\nThe trio showed off the matching ink on Instagram. \u201cProject Semicolon is a movement dedicated to presenting hope for those suffering from depression, thoughts of suicide, addiction, and self-injury,\u201d captioned Boe on her Instagram.\n\nDorfman also describes his own personal struggles with mental health in his past. \u201cI struggled with addiction and depression issues through high school and early college,\u201d he wrote alongside a photo of the gang\u2019s matching tattoos. \u201cI reached out and asked for help. At the time, I thought my life was over, I thought I\u2019d never live past the age of 21. Today I\u2019m grateful to be alive, in this new chapter of life in recovery, standing with my colleagues and friends, making art that helps other people.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gettyimages-624757174-h2016.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gettyimages-624757174-h2016.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Reed", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/selena-gomez-tattoo-matching-semicolons-13-reasons-why-cast-992400/", "title": "Selena Gomez and \u201913 Reasons Why\u2019 Castmates Got Matching Tattoos", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "For a good cause.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Sam Reed", "tags": "Style News", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Selena Gomez and \u201913 Reasons Why\u2019 Castmates Got Matching Tattoos", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/selena-gomez-tattoo-matching-semicolons-13-reasons-why-cast-992400/", "description": "For a good cause.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gettyimages-624757174-h2016.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Selena Gomez Tattoo: Matching Semicolons for 13 Reasons Why Cast"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-04-10T10:01:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-04-11T09:23:47+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "For a good cause.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Selena Gomez and \u201913 Reasons Why\u2019 Castmates Got Matching Tattoos", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gettyimages-624757174-h2016.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491818484.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
