Gender is not fluid; it\u2019s ordained by God.\u201d\n\nThe initial backlash didn\u2019t stop Dillard, who doubled down last week.\n\n\u201cI pity Jazz, 4 those who take advantage of him in order 2 promote their agenda, including the parents who allow these kinds of decisions 2 be made by a child,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nDerek Dillard has been cut from TLC after transphobic comments about Jazz Jennings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sad that ppl would use a juvenile this way. Again, nothing against him, just unfortunate what\u2019s on tv these days.\n\n\u201cI Am Jazz\u201d follows now-17-year-old Jennings, who was born male and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria at 4 years old.\n\nAt 5 years old, Jennings began transitioning to female.\n\nThe TLC show, which recently completed its third season, follows her and her family \u201cdealing with typical teen drama through the lens of a transgender youth.\u201d\n\n\u201cDerick I understand that you may think your way is the highway, but I\u2019ll go ahead and say it outright: you are a hateful person. I mean it from the bottom of my heart,\u201d one person responded to Dillard. \u201cYou have absolutely no respect for anyone that is not just like you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t pity Jazz. I pity you for being a hypocrite,\u201d wrote another. \u201cYou claim to love everyone, yet you can\u2019t call a transgender female by her correct pronouns.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, TLC said Dillard would no longer appear on its shows.\n\n\u201cWe want to let our viewers know that Derick Dillard has not participated in \u2018Counting On\u2019 for months and the network has no plans to feature him in the future. We want to reiterate that Derick\u2019s personal statements do not reflect the views of the network,\u201d the network said.\n\n\u201cTLC is proud to share the story of Jazz Jennings and her family and will continue to do so.\u201d", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/11/12/EG6RI2NFYQACGUM7SD7WWQVF3I.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/11/12/EG6RI2NFYQACGUM7SD7WWQVF3I.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Feldman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/11/12/tlc-cut-ties-with-derick-dillard-jill-duggars-husband-over-transphobic-comments-about-jazz-jennings/", "title": "TLC cut ties with Derick Dillard, Jill Duggar\u2019s husband, over transphobic comments about Jazz Jennings", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Kate Feldman", "canonical": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/11/12/tlc-cut-ties-with-derick-dillard-jill-duggars-husband-over-transphobic-comments-about-jazz-jennings/"}, "description": "TLC finally revealed that Derick Dillard hasn\u2019t been part of \u201cCounting On\u201d for months after a second set of transphobic comments.", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "TLC cut ties with Derick Dillard, Jill Duggar\u2019s husband, over transphobic comments about Jazz Jennings", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/11/12/tlc-cut-ties-with-derick-dillard-jill-duggars-husband-over-transphobic-comments-about-jazz-jennings/", "description": "TLC finally revealed that Derick Dillard hasn\u2019t been part of \u201cCounting On\u201d for months after a second set of transphobic comments.
