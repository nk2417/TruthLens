Wanna break the Internet tomorrow? \u2014 Brie Larson (@brielarson) September 5, 2018\n\nEntertainment Weekly has since responded to Larson\u2019s tweet, hinting that the surprise will be happening at 12 p.m. ET.\n\nYes! Meet us here at noon ET. We\u2019ve got something Marvel-ous in mind. \ud83d\ude09 \u2014 Entertainment Weekly (@EW) September 5, 2018\n\nIt\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to exactly what reveal will be breaking the internet, whether its a few official promo photos \u2014 similarly to how the magazine has covered upcoming releases Aquaman and Shazam! \u2014 or something else entirely. But with rumors swirling around that the film\u2019s first trailer could arrive sometime this month, fans will surely be excited to see the promotional campaign officially beginning.\n\nCaptain Marvel will see Larson\u2019s Carol Danvers making her highly-anticipated big screen debut, as she becomes a superhero in the 1990s amid the Kree-Skrull War. The film is co-directed by Mississippi Grind and It\u2019s Kind of a Funny Story\u2018s Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, and will also star Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Jude Law, and Lashana Lynch.\n\n\u201cWe really were bringing so much of what was already in the comics onto the screen, it felt like, in terms of the amazing character who\u2019s so funny and sassy and talks back, and she\u2019s fearless,\u201d screenwriter Geneva Robertson-Dworet said in a previous interview. \u201cI love that Carol Danvers is so funny. She has a blast when she kicks ass. Those comics are amazing! It\u2019s an amazing world and sandbox to play in. You\u2019re working with incredible creative people, every day. I had a total dream experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the way the film opens is much different than an origin movie, and because she is a heroine that you haven\u2019t seen before, we\u2019re able to tell this story structurally in a way that will feel unexpected and hopefully will keep audiences off balance,\u201d producer Nate Moore said of the 1990s-set adventure. \u201cStill balanced enough that they can enjoy the film, but even just making it a period film is sort of interesting in that it\u2019s not just a function of the world as we know it in the MCU today.\u201d\n\nAre you excited by Larson\u2019s Captain Marvel tease? What do you think the surprise could be? Let us know what you think in the comments below.\n\nAvengers: Infinity War is now available on digital platforms, DVD, and Blu-ray. Ant-Man and the Wasp is in theaters now.
