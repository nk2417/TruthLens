Her style is classic yet still very modern\u2014hello, she loves the cold-shoulder look as much as we do. The duchess also loves to mix up her beauty look\u2014ICYMI, she apparently changes her hair for each pregnancy\u2014but we dare you to name a time you've seen Kate wearing red nail polish or coral on her fingers. Coming up blank? It turns out there's a very specific reason.\n\n*Marie Claire* U.K. reported recently that only natural-looking nails are permitted at official royal events, which tend to be where and when photos of her get taken. That kind of explains why Queen Elizabeth II has been wearing the same shade of polish, Essie's Ballet Slippers, since 1989. According to Essie, it's \"the only color Her Majesty would wear.\" It is a cult classic, after all. And hey, if you know what you like\u2026\n\nKate wore a similar, sheer pink shade on her wedding day. Her manicurist, Marina Sandoval, told the Daily Mail in 2011 that she mixed Bourjois Rose Lounge and Essie Allure to create the custom shade.\n\nPrince Harry's girlfriend and most-likely-soon-to-be-official fianc\u00e9e, Meghan Markle, has also been spotted wearing natural nail shades when she's out with Harry. At the Invictus Games she had her nails painted with a sheer pinkish-white shade.\n\nSo why the no-bold-nail-polish rule in 2017? We love those shades, personally. But royals are expected to dress and behave according to strict, traditional codes\u2014they can't sign autographs, for example. And if it that's the royal rule, we'll respect it. The diamonds in Princess Diana's tiara that Kate's been known to wear make quite the statement anyway.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n-Kate Middleton Just Debuted a Gorgeous New Bob-Kate Middleton's Two Favorite Fashion Brands Are Collaborating-Prince William and Kate Middleton Tried to Get 'Game of Thrones' Spoilers Out of One of the Show's Actors", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/6908e5edc221e874a37c43e4/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6910d1f2d486cb4be30d2542/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68fb91f48e7a821cd05daecf/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6902283d601dff04f14d5bc6/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/69174c099747b5d130b803e2/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690a2debe28cbde87dacf946/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68ff927c228cfc84b2391663/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6904e66b71ae894e89117f3b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/69012339a18581c0faf5cbd3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59eb837f017a263f7ded2f3c/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/kate-middleton-nail-polish-lede.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_640%2Cq_80%2Cw_640/v1501612506/glamour_blake-lively-mad-lib-makeover-tutorial.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68fe47b1d896c6cbe8f46045/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/glamour-banner-v2.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/logo-oneNav.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691388f0185ff327272e0075/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59eb837f53deb33d150cacb9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kate-middleton-nails-social.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59eb837f53deb33d150cacb9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kate-middleton-nails-social.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Reimel"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/kate-middleton-no-red-nail-polish", "title": "There's a Reason You'll Never See Kate Middleton Wearing Red Nail Polish", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Erin Reimel", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Kate Middleton has been known to stick with sheer, neutral shades\u2014and there's a reason she doesn't go with bolder colors.", "id": "59eb56517f7b2b4f4cae462a", "keywords": "kate middleton,nail polish,dress code", "news_keywords": "kate middleton,nail polish,dress code", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59eb56517f7b2b4f4cae462a", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Kate Middleton has been known to stick with sheer, neutral shades\u2014and there's a reason she doesn't go with bolder colors.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59eb830a7f7b2b4f4cae462c/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/kate-middleton-nail-polish.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59eb830a7f7b2b4f4cae462c/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/kate-middleton-nail-polish.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Sheers and neutrals it is. \ud83d\udc85", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59eb837f53deb33d150cacb9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kate-middleton-nails-social.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Here's Why You'll Never See Kate Middleton Wearing Red Nail Polish", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/kate-middleton-no-red-nail-polish"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-10-21T17:37:55.214Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-21T17:37:55.214Z", "author": "Erin Reimel"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "Sheers and neutrals it is. \ud83d\udc85", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59eb837f53deb33d150cacb9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kate-middleton-nails-social.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Here's Why You'll Never See Kate Middleton Wearing Red Nail Polish"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59eb837f53deb33d150cacb9/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/kate-middleton-nails-social.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508607475.214, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
