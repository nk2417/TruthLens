She told Nylon Magazine in a recent interview, \"I love food, so having a lot of food allergies now and just having a really sensitive body, it forces me to be very mindful and conscious and eat when I\u2019m hungry, not just when I\u2019m bored and just really slow down. Everything in moderation.\"\n\nMore entertainment news", "images": ["https://www.northjersey.com/gcdn/-mm-/ff5238309c282df4dcef901f7d025f52751931e0/c=0-60-600-660/local/-/media/2017/10/11/Bergen/NorthJersey/636433333661917744-HeadShot-AdamsStiansenLaura-002.jpg?width=48&height=48&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.northjersey.com/gciaf/prod/p?a=pageview&p=PNJM-TEALIUM-TANGENT&m=web&k=f14ebdd6-0569-4c64-af73-99937bc06379&s=noscript", "https://www.northjersey.com/gcdn/-mm-/332724df79ead1434e2864c356f21eab95d49596/c=92-186-1156-787/local/-/media/2018/01/27/Bergen/NorthJersey/636526442422936083-SUB-SZA-Gap-2.jpg?width=1064&height=601&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.northjersey.com/gcdn/-mm-/332724df79ead1434e2864c356f21eab95d49596/c=92-186-1156-787/local/-/media/2018/01/27/Bergen/NorthJersey/636526442422936083-SUB-SZA-Gap-2.jpg?width=1064&height=601&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.northjersey.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/01/28/6-things-know-sza-grammy-nominated-r-b-singer-songwriter-maplewood/1071820001/", "title": "SZA: 6 things to know about the Grammy nominated singer from Maplewood", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "SZA: 6 things to know about the Grammy nominated singer from Maplewood", "description": "With the Grammy Awards airing 7:30 p.m. tonight on CBS, it's a good time to get to know nominee SZA, a Maplewood native", "url": "https://www.northjersey.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/01/28/6-things-know-sza-grammy-nominated-r-b-singer-songwriter-maplewood/1071820001/", "site_name": "North Jersey Media Group", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.northjersey.com/gcdn/-mm-/332724df79ead1434e2864c356f21eab95d49596/c=92-186-1156-787/local/-/media/2018/01/27/Bergen/NorthJersey/636526442422936083-SUB-SZA-Gap-2.jpg?width=1064&height=601&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1064, "height": 601}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Laura Adams Stiansen", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "With the Grammy Awards airing 7:30 p.m. tonight on CBS, it's a good time to get to know nominee SZA, a Maplewood native", "fb": {"pages": 117907407522, "app_id": 130358300392751}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.northjersey.com/gcdn/-mm-/332724df79ead1434e2864c356f21eab95d49596/c=92-186-1156-787/local/-/media/2018/01/27/Bergen/NorthJersey/636526442422936083-SUB-SZA-Gap-2.jpg?width=1064&height=532&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@northjersey", "creator": "@northjersey", "title": "SZA: 6 things to know about the Grammy nominated singer from Maplewood", "description": "With the Grammy Awards airing 7:30 p.m. tonight on CBS, it's a good time to get to know nominee SZA, a Maplewood native"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517115600.0, "source": "https://www.northjersey.com", "summary": ""}
