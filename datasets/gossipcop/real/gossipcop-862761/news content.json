It has been super important to me and also HUMBLING. All the support that I've been getting from all my IG friends helped me when it was tough so THANK YOU for all the love and support.\u201d\n\nThe image shows a heart drawn in red chalk, with the words \u201cRehab\u201d and \u201c36/36\u201d scrawled inside.\n\nBack in February, Harper, 51, was working out at a gym with a few friends when he suddenly dropped to his knees, fell to the floor and stopped breathing.\n\n\u201cI was in full cardiac arrest,\u201d the fitness trainer told Savannah Guthrie in an interview with TODAY in April. \u201cMy heart stopped. Not to be dramatic, but I was dead. I was on that ground dead.\u201d\n\nLuckily for Harper, two doctors who were in the gym at the time were able to perform CPR and administer a defibrillator before paramedics arrived to take him to the hospital.\n\n\u201cIt was super scary for me because I woke up and I was so confused,\u201d he said. \u201cI was like Dory from 'Finding Nemo' because I had this short-term memory, so I was reliving the heart attack over and over again.\u201d\n\nHarper later discovered that he had suffered from the sudden cardiac arrest because he had high levels of a particle in his blood known as lipoprotein(a), a condition that is hereditary. (Harper\u2019s mother died of a heart attack.)\n\nHe told Savannah that it was \"hugely shocking\" to him that he'd suffered a heart attack.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about myself,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about the fact that genetics played a part in this. It is so important to know your health.\u201d\n\nHarper was in a medically induced coma for two days after being admitted to the hospital, and had two stents placed to keep his coronary arteries open and to reduce the risk of a future heart attack.\n\nIn the weeks and months following, Harper documented his progress on social media as he slowly worked his way back to wellness.\n\n\"It's been hard,\u201d he told Savannah. \"I'm going through some depression. You really face your mortality. And I'm really understanding what's important in life.\"", "images":
