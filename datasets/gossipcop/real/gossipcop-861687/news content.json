And when Dodd, now 72, confirmed that she was \u201cdrunk as a skunk\u201d in the picture, Johansson knew she had to meet her and \u201csee your drunk face.\u201d\n\nThursday night, she finally got to see it.\n\n\u201cSo she came last night to the \u2018Rough Night\u2019 premiere, and we did get kind of trashed,\u201d Johansson said.\n\nThe actress doesn\u2019t plan on making it a one-night stand with her lookalike, gushing to Colbert about how nice she was \u2014 and calling her a \u201clush\u201d in an endearing way. She said she\u2019d like to visit Dodd\u2019s home as well.\n\n\u201cI will eventually make my to Arkansas and continue this lovely family reunion,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s just awesome.\u201d\n\nWatch the video above.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/johansson.jpg?fit=617%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5x4_082025_COVER.jpg?fit=240%2C300&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/johansson.jpg?fit=617%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matt Pressberg", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid", "Border-Radius Box-Shadow Rgba", "Rgba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/scarlett-johansson-drinks-with-grandma-doppelganger-rough-night-video/", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Finally Got \u2018Trashed\u2019 With Grandma Doppelganger (Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Finally Got 'Trashed' With Grandma Doppelganger (Video)", "description": "Scarjo partied with a Reddit user's grandmother Thursday at 'Rough Night' premiere", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/scarlett-johansson-drinks-with-grandma-doppelganger-rough-night-video/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/johansson.jpg?fit=617%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 617, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-17T21:54:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-17T22:06:45+00:00"}, "author": "Matt Pressberg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Matt Pressberg", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "late_show, rough-night, scarlett_johansson, stephen-colbert", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "movies, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497736457.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
