conditions and their families \u2014 Kate Middleton expressed the importance of such an organization.\n\n\u201cThis Children's Hospice Week, as Patron of East Anglia's Children's Hospices, I am celebrating the remarkable and life-changing support provided by children's hospices and palliative care charities across the U.K.,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThey offer a lifeline to children and families facing the unimaginable.\u201d\n\nThe theme of this year\u2019s Children\u2019s Hospice Week is \u201cLife\u2019s Short,\u201d a declaration that clearly means a lot to the

spread joy and positivity across the U.K., encouraging everyone to make the most of moments that matter,\u201d she wrote. \u201cSpending quality time together is such an important aspect of family life and for me, as a mother, it is the simple family moments like playing outside together that I cherish.\u201d\n\nThe 36-year-old concluded her letter, which the organization said they were \"delighted to share,\" by urging everyone to \u201cchampion the vital role that children's hospices play in helping seriously ill children and families to have more precious moments.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Kate made her first appearance since giving birth in April by attending the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.\n\nFor the big event, Kate re-wore one of her favorite outfits, while her daughter, Princess Charlotte, stole the show with her signature wave.\n\nHere\u2019s a look back at some of the best moments from the royal wedding:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images":
