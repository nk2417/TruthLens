Your baby girl is so beautiful! You are so strong, you made that look so easy!\" Kim wrote on Twitter, tagging Khloe. \"I'm so happy I was able to return the favor of holding your leg while you pushed LOL.\"\n\n\u2014Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) April 13, 2018\n\nKim, a recent mother of three herself, also expressed excitement that her daughters North and Chicago will be able to grow up alongside Khloe's newborn daughter \"as best friends the way we are.\"\n\nHappy Saturday loves! A post shared by Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) on Dec 16, 2017 at 10:52am PST Dec 16, 2017 at 10:52am PST\n\nIn a separate tweet posted shortly after, Kim seemed to gush about her new niece being \"gorgeous.\"\n\n\u2014Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) April 13, 2018\n\nBut while many fans appreciated the heartwarming display of sisterly love that the Kardashian-Jenners have come to be known for, others were focused on the man in Khloe's life.\n\nThe father of Khloe's daughter and her boyfriend of over a year, Tristan Thompson, was reportedly present in the delivery room as well \u2014 despite allegations that he cheated on Khloe throughout her pregnancy with multiple women. No one in the family has yet commented on the rumors, and people responded to Kim's tweets with fervent disapproval of his alleged behavior and demands to know whether he has been by Khloe's side.\n\nAustralian writer and radio producer Carly Heading wrote that she hopes Khloe \"kicked a certain someone\" with the leg that Kim wasn't holding.\n\nOther Twitter users responded to Kim's message in similar ways.\n\nOthers seemed less concerned about Thompson's presence in the delivery room and more interested in finding out whether the cheating rumors are true.\n\nWhile fans are clearly angry about Thompson's alleged infidelity \u2014 and desperate for more information \u2014 People has reported that Khloe has \"basically already forgiven him.\"\n\n\"She's so incredibly happy that her baby is here, that she is big and strong and healthy and beautiful, and so right now Khloe truly has no other cares in the world. She isn't even mad at Tristan right now,\" an unnamed Kardashian family source told the outlet. \"She is in a bubble of love and peace and happiness right now.\"\n\nIt's safe to say that fans are very invested in the new mom's relationship status \u2014 but what's most important is that her baby is healthy and that Khloe is recovering smoothly post-birth.\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.", "images": ["https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5ad0d0ad7708e90cd36e0043?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5ad0d0ad7708e90cd36e0044?width=700", "https://i.insider.com/651f2ddf6561dd877e7242d0?width=168&format=jpeg&auto=webp&crop=1:1,smart", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5ad0d0ad7708e90cd36e0043?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Callie Ahlgrim", "Enter Your Email", "Follow Authors", "Never Miss A Story"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-kardashian-holds-khloe-leg-birth-delivery-room-tristan-thompson-2018-4", "title": "Kim Kardashian reveals she held sister Khloe's leg while she gave birth \u2014 but fans only want to know if Tristan Thompson held the other", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Kim Kardashian reveals she held sister Khloe's leg while she gave birth \u2014 but fans only want to know if Tristan Thompson held the other", "datePublished": "2018-04-13T15:43:00.000Z", "dateModified": "2018-04-13T15:43:57.000Z", "news_keywords": "News, Khloe Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Family, Celebrity", "description": "Kim Kardashian West revealed that she was by her sister's side in the delivery room, but fan reactions focused on Khloe's boyfriend and the cheating rumors.", "author": "Callie Ahlgrim", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "tbi-vertical": "News", "og": {"title": "Kim Kardashian reveals she held sister Khloe's leg while she gave birth \u2014 but fans only want to know if Tristan Thompson held the other", "description": "Kim Kardashian West revealed that she was by her sister's side in the delivery room, but fan reactions focused on Khloe's boyfriend and the cheating rumors.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-kardashian-holds-khloe-leg-birth-delivery-room-tristan-thompson-2018-4", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/5ad0d0ad7708e90cd36e0043?width=1200&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@businessinsider"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"psvp": "c"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "5ad0d0ad7708e90cd36e0045", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"sections": "News", "tags": "Page Type:story"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2025-05", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
