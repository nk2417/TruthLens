They hopped in a truck and took the long drive to see the house, and Cutler promised they could have a herd of goats if it would seal the deal.\n\n\u201cWhat if there are goats there already? Are we in? Because I need to make a call then. Release the goats, please.\u201d\n\nWith the sports schedule entering the annual summer drought, Very Cavallari is one of the best viewing options on Sunday night.\n\n[jwplayer RWtYnVFO-t2dCqACG]\n\nMore Very Cavallari!\n\nKristin Cavallari loves that fans see 'the real side' of Jay Cutler\n\nKristin Cavallari tells Jay Cutler: 'I'm with you because I love you not because I need you.'\n\n'Very Cavallari' is returning for a second season", "images": ["https://ftw.usatoday.com/gciaf/prod/p?a=pageview&p=SFTW-TEALIUM-TANGENT&m=web&k=f14ebdd6-0569-4c64-af73-99937bc06379&s=noscript", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/images/smg/2025/03/06/SFTW/81734835007-90-769471.jpeg?crop=999,562,x0,y0&width=999&height=562&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://ftw.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/images/smg/2025/03/06/SFTW/81734835007-90-769471.jpeg?width=660&height=423&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/images/smg/2025/03/06/SFTW/81734835007-90-769471.jpeg?crop=999,562,x0,y0&width=999&height=562&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2018/07/18/kristin-cavallari-very-cavallari-jay-cutler-new-house-goats/81734846007/", "title": "Watch Jay Cutler and Kristin Cavallari argue over house hunting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#EA2224", "og": {"title": "Watch Jay Cutler and Kristin Cavallari argue over house hunting", "description": "Jay Cutler wants to buy a new house in Nashville, and he's willing to share his home with a bunch of goats if it means he can move.
