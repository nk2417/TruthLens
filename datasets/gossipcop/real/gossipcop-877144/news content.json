It also stated Nance had a history of opiate abuse and anxiety. His death has been ruled an accident.\n\nNance \u2014 who competed on Emily Maynard\u2018s season 8 of The Bachelorette in 2012 \u2014 was found unresponsive in Austin, Texas, on May 28. He was rushed to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. Officials at the time said they did not expect foul play. He was 31.\n\nThe report revealed that the man was found with lacerations on his right forearm and neck.\n\nNance appeared on the ABC reality series when he was 26, working as a rehab counselor, and revealed in his Bachelorette introduction package that he had previously struggled with prescription painkillers abuse.\n\n\u201cI was addicted to prescription pain medicine. It all starts out fun and then somewhere along the road, it just turned into something else. It\u2019s a vicious cycle and it ate away at me for a long time,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI\u2019m almost two years sober, now, and it\u2019s not that easy \u2014 you have to completely change your way of living.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of his death, many franchise alums shared kind words about the man, with Sean Lowe calling him \u201ca sweet man with a kind soul,\u201d and Chris Bukowski commemorating him as \u201ca gentle man with a huge heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cSuch a kind heart with so much talent,\u201d Maynard tweeted at the time. \u201cSending prayers and love to his family and friends.\u201d\n\nAlthough he didn\u2019t win Maynard\u2019s heart, Nance returned to Austin, where he went on to make music for several years.\n\nOf the troubled reality star, a Bachelorette source previously told PEOPLE that the spotlight of the show had weighed heavily on Nance.\n\n\u201cHe was the type of guy who felt things very deeply,\u201d the source said. \u201cSuch a sensitive guy. You\u2019ve got to remember that I met him when he was in his mid 20s, so he was pretty directionless. I don\u2019t know that being on TV gave him any further direction. But he had such a good aura.\u201d", "images":
