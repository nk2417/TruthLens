Donovan,\u201d but Xavier Dolan says the decision \u201chas nothing to do with\u201d her performance. Rather, there\u2019s simply too much going on in the movie and the original cut was already more than four hours long. He announced the news on Instagram, where he shared effusive praise for his would-be leading lady.\n\n\u201cWhat you need to hear from me is that Jessica Chastain\u2019s character, after what was a long period of reflection, had to be cut from the film,\u201d Dolan writes on Instagram. \u201cIt was an extremely difficult decision to make. I feel, toward Jessica, a very sincere love, and a great admiration. The decision was editorial and narrative, in that it has nothing to do with a performance, and everything to do with a character, and the compatibility of its storyline.\u201d\n\nDolan goes on to explain that \u201cthis \u2018villain\u2019 subplot, albeit funny and entertaining, didn\u2019t feel like it belonged to the rest of the story, which ended up not being on heroes or their nemesis, bur [sic] rather on childhood, and its dreams.\u201d\n\n\u201cJessica has, since the very beginning, defended this project, and defended me on so many occasions,\u201d he continues. \u201cShe is a terrific actress, a politically engaged artist, what is more, who relentlessly champions the causes she believes in. She is respected by her peers, and beloved by her public.\u201d\n\nRead the rest of his lengthy, comma-happy statement below, and take solace in the fact that Kit Harington, Ben Schnetzer, Natalie Portman, Bella Thorne, Susan Sarandon, Jared Keeso, Kathy Bates, Thandie Newton, Michael Gambon, and Sarah Gadon are all still in the film.", "images": ["https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2246465707.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2243714058.jpg?w=3000&h=2800&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TNB_05859_R-H-2024-1.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7135.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_5669082ia.jpg?w=780&h=520&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_5669082ia.jpg?w=650", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/anaconda.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tainy-karol-unica.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/kelly-dodd-heather-dubrow-2.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thoughts-and-prayers-hbo.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple_TV_Your_Friends_and_Neighbors_key_art_graphic_header_16_9_show_home.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-01-at-8.32.46\u202fPM.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2243843179.jpg?w=3000&h=2425&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HZBN_S2_FG_208_00353223_Still731_3000.jpg?w=3000&h=1688&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2243810544.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/dish-vs-espn-sling-passes.png?resize=232,175", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Robert-Gene-Pietranton-1.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/shutterstock_5669082ia.jpg?w=650", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Nordine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/the-death-and-life-of-john-f-donovan-jessica-chastain-xavier-dolan-1201924983/", "title": "\u2018The Death and Life of John F.
