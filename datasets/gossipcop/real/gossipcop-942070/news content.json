Swift not only co-wrote the song, but the \u201cMad Men\u201d-inspired video, based in the early 1960s and featuring sumptuous period detail, was based on her concept, the group\u2019s Jennifer Nettles said.\n\n\u201cShe actually reached out to us and said, \u2018I\u2019ve got a great idea for the video,\u2019 and she wrote the treatment,\u201d Nettles, told People last week.\n\nActor Brandon Roth plays the man, and Nettles turns in a memorable performance as the martini-swilling but vengeful wife.\n\n\u201cShe loves this song,\u201d said Nettles. \u201cShe loves our recording of it. She\u2019s been such a champion of ours, not only for many, many years, but also where this project is concerned. She\u2019s just super excited that we\u2019re doing it.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nLike the song, the clip is a step away from Swift\u2019s own, higher-concept videos from her recent album \u201cReputation.\u201d She is currently on the European leg of the tour behind the album, which launched in Arizona on May 9. The tour resumes Stateside on June 30 and carries through until early October, when it moves to Australia and Japan.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/taylor-swift-sugarland-babe.jpg?w=1000&h=495&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/taylor-swift-sugarland-babe.jpg?w=1000&h=495&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Variety Staff", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/taylor-swift-plays-a-homewrecking-redhead-in-sugarlands-mad-men-inspired-babe-video-1202840350/", "title": "Taylor Swift Plays a Homewrecking Redhead in Sugarland\u2019s \u2018Mad Men\u2019-Inspired \u2018Babe\u2019 Video", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Taylor Swift takes another shot at her wholesome image in the new video Sugarland\u2019s single \u201cBabe,\u201d playing a red-headed secretary who is having an affair with her married boss.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Variety Staff", "tags": "Sugarland, Taylor Swift", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Taylor Swift Plays a Homewrecking Redhead in Sugarland\u2019s \u2018Mad Men\u2019-Inspired \u2018Babe\u2019 Video", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/taylor-swift-plays-a-homewrecking-redhead-in-sugarlands-mad-men-inspired-babe-video-1202840350/", "description": "Taylor Swift takes another shot at her wholesome image in the new video Sugarland\u2019s single \u201cBabe,\u201d playing a red-headed secretary who is having an affair with her married boss.
