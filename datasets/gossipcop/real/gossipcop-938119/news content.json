They all have lives. They've all moved on.\"\n\n\"We're just human beings; we're going to be here for a very short time,\" Jenner added. \"We come and we go and at the end, when it's all said and done, hopefully your family is going to be there.\"\n\nCaitlyn shares son Burt Jenner, 39, and daughter Cassandra Marino, 37, with first wife Chrystie Crownoves. She also shares sons Brandon and Brody Jenner with second wife Linda Thompson ... and, most famously, daughters Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner with most recent ex-wife Kris Jenner.\n\nJenner also played an important role in raising Kris' four children with the late Robert Kardashian -- Kourtney Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, and Rob Kardashian -- which was chronicled on the family's E! reality show.\n\nShe spent a lot of 2017 in a war of words with Kris and the Kardashian children -- who believed Jenner's memoir \"The Secrets of My Life\" was filled with lies -- and the trans community, who took issue with her initial support of Donald Trump. \"I got the trans community out there bashing on me, I got the Kardashians out there bashing on me,\" she also told the publication, which noted the interview was done back in October. \"All I do is sit here in the house and try to stay out of trouble.\"\n\n\"I hope when I get up there to the pearly gates, God looks down and says, 'You did a good damn job,\" the famous Olympian added. \"'You won the Games, raised wonderful children, and you know, you made a difference in the world. Yeah, come on in,' That's the way I want to go.\" She also told the reporter that before she transitioned, she wanted to put a stipulation in her will that she be buried in women's clothes. \"I thought about that a lot over the years,\" she said. \"And it would shock everybody. Screw 'em.\u201d\n\nIn a more recent interview Jenner did with Piers Morgan, she said she doesn't \"talk to the Kardashians anymore.\"\n\n\"The only ones I am concerned about are Kendall and Kylie,\" she added. \"They are my biological kids. I spent 23 years carting them around.\"", "images": ["https://images.toofab.com/image/ec/2by3/2025/11/20/ec4a53345526471d9d10847ba27ea323_xs.jpg",
