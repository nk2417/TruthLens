My house is now being evacuated to get all of my pets out of there safely,\" Hilton wrote to her twitter followers. \"Thank you to all the firefighters who are risking their lives to save ours. You are true heroes!\"\n\nShe included with her post a widely shared video of flames burning early Wednesday morning just alongside the 405 freeway in Los Angeles.\n\nA fire broke out in the Sepulveda Pass of the 405 freeway in Los Angeles. Many drivers and passengers captured incredible footage of the blaze during their morning commute.\n\nDo-Gooder Gallery\n\nLea Michele also chose not to take any chances and packed her bags early Wednesday morning. \"Praying for everyone in LA...grabbed what I loved most this morning and so grateful to my friends for taking us in..\" she wrote on social media.\n\nThe \"Mayor\" star, who attended The Hollywood Reporter's Power 100 Women in Entertainment Breakfast after evacuating, is staying with close friends, including celebrity stylist Brad Goreski.\n\nThe flames reached the Bel Air estate and winery owned by media mogul Rupert Murdoch.\n\nRoxanne Langer at Moraga Vineyards in Bel Air says a temperature-controlled wine storage shed burned after the fire erupted before dawn Wednesday, but it's unclear how much wine was lost.\n\nShe says firefighters stepped in to douse the flames with the aid of helicopters and that other storage sheds, the winery itself and the estate's unoccupied house are not damaged.\n\nThe winery has been evacuated.\n\nMurdoch bought the property for about $30 million in 2013.\n\nLanger says it appears the 7 acres of vines suffered only slight damage and the grapes already had been harvested.\n\nIn a Facebook statement, Murdoch says some neighbors suffered heavy losses and his thoughts and prayers are with them.\n\nOther celebs, too, posted to social media about evacuations, including Lionel Richie, who said on Twitter that \"due to the devastating wildfires, and helping family evacuate to a safer place,\" he had to cancel his concert scheduled for Wednesday night.\n\nWe are scared and devastated for all those who have lost their homes or who are evacuating like us.
