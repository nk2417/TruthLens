Jackson and Judge Judy stepped out for dinner in Los Angeles over the weekend, reminding us just how much we love this friendship. The \u201dCaptain Marvel\u201d star shared a candid photo with his pal \u2014 aka Judith Sheindlin \u2014 on Instagram.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany users commented about the seemingly unlikely friendship, dying to know what the actor and daytime TV boss could be talking about. Well, these two actually go way back. \u201cThe Kong: Skull Island\u201d star was asked about the origin of their bond last year on \u201cWatch What Happens Live.\u201d\n\nJackson, 69, and Sheindlin, 75, had mutual friends, meeting through the actor\u2019s agent, Toni Howard. The pair also know each other through Jackson\u2019s lawyer \u2014 \u201cmy lawyer\u2019s husband is the guy who makes her deals,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Jackson recalled, they met at Howard\u2019s house, and they used to smoke cigarettes together. \u201cSo we would sit in Toni\u2019s backyard and smoke, and when Judy stopped smoking, she made me stop smoking. She sent me to her doctor in White Plains, who actually treats you with sodium pentothal, and I quit smoking. But Judy used to get up in the middle of the night to smoke. She\u2019s like, \u2018I used to wake up to smoke.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWWHL\u201d host Andy Cohen asked Jackson if Judge Judy was intimidating, to which he replied, \u201cNo! Judy\u2019s awesome. She\u2019s great. \u2026 I\u2019ve had tea with Judy at the Dorchester in London, and hang out and fly back and forth cross-country with her on planes. Judy\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nJudge Judy and Samuel L. Jackson sharing a laugh.

Her CBS show has been on the air since 1996, and she\u2019s estimated to be worth around $300 million.\n\nIn 2017, \u201cJudge Judy\u201d wrapped its fourth consecutive year as the most-watched syndicated TV show, and it continues to break records left and right. She counts her pal as one of her regular viewers.\n\nJackson revealed on the \u201cToday\u201d show that he includes in his contracts that his trailer on set must have a satellite television so \u201cI can watch judge shows all day when I\u2019m at work \u2026 all of them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, \u201cJudge Judy\u201d would be one of those \u201cjudge shows,\u201d in case you were wondering. He also praised his BFF on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d saying he loves watching \u201cJudge Judy\u201d \u201call the time,\u201d adding they get together \u201cat least four or five times a year.\u201d\n\nHey, by Hollywood standards, that\u2019s a lot.\n\nStories That Inspire You Your Support Fuels Our Mission Your Support Fuels Our Mission Become a Member Today As the year ends, our reporting does not slow down.
