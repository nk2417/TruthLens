The tweet\u2019s text reads, \u201cWe\u2019re going to need a bigger mug.\u201d\n\nRipa appears to be ready to announce her co-host, ending a drama-filled year of going solo after former NFL star Michael Strahan left to join Good Morning America. New York\u2019s WABC later confirmed that an announcement will be made on tomorrow\u2019s 9 a.m. show.\n\nVarious names have popped up as potential successors to Strahan. Last December, Ripa said there had been an \u201coutpouring of interest\u201d from candidates, but emphasized there was no timetable to fill the seat. In the interim, guest hosts have included Megyn Kelly, Fred Savage, Jerry O\u2019Connell and Anderson Cooper and the show\u2019s ratings have remained fairly steady.\n\nEven though it was a move within the same Disney-ABC family, Strahan\u2019s departure for GMA surprised fans and viewers \u2013 as well as Ripa herself. Saying she had been blindsided, she took several unplanned days off from the show, returning after her fans rallied to show support.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe final show for Strahan fell on Friday the 13th, last May, and Ripa wore a black dress for the occasion. The tenor of that last episode was markedly more tense than during the duo\u2019s four-year run, when they injected the show with new energy and relevance after the retirement of Regis Philbin.", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ripa.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ripa.jpg?w=971"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ripa.jpg?w=971", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dade Hayes", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2017/04/ripa-teases-new-live-co-host-1202079857/", "title": "Kelly Ripa Teases Monday Announcement Of New \u2018Live\u2019 Co-Host", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "In a Twitter video, Kelly Ripa told viewers to \"tune in tomorrow,\" presumably for the announcement of her new co-host.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Dade Hayes", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kelly Ripa Teases Monday Announcement Of New \u2018Live\u2019 Co-Host", "url": "https://deadline.com/2017/04/ripa-teases-new-live-co-host-1202079857/", "description": "In a Twitter video, Kelly Ripa told viewers to \"tune in tomorrow,\" presumably for the announcement of her new co-host.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ripa.jpg?w=971", "width": 971, "height": 800, "alt": "Kelly Ripa Teases Announcement Of New 'Live' Co-host"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-04-30T22:17:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2024-12-18T23:31:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "In a Twitter video, Kelly Ripa told viewers to \"tune in tomorrow,\" presumably for the announcement of her new co-host.", "site": "@Deadline", "creator": "@dadehayes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kelly Ripa Teases Monday Announcement Of New \u2018Live\u2019 Co-Host", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ripa.jpg?w=971"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493590655.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
