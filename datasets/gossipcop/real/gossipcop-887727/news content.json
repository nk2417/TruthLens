{"url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/dynasty-cw-fashion-interview-cast-wardrobe-stylist", "text": "Dynasty is indeed a series about the upper crust of the one percent, but the revamp has come a long way from some of the sexist and homophobic undertones present in the '80s run. The 2017 version boasts a diverse, inclusive, and gorgeous cast, including Steven Carrington, who is openly gay and environmentally conscious; Cristal and Sammy Jo, both Venezuelan and proud of their heritage; and the Colbys, who are now played by black actors. And though there is a catfight \u2014 bringing back one of the most infamous moments from the original show \u2014 this time, the squabble is happening because both Fallon Carrington and Cristal are vying for a leadership position at Carrington Atlantic.\n\nThe show is steeped in female empowerment and gives us a taste of how powerful women are dressing in the office in 2017. \u201cWe wanted to show her femininity, but also show that she\u2019s COO of a company,\u201d Markworth-Pollack said of Cristal\u2019s wardrobe. \u201cShe can still be bold and rock the structured looks, but she doesn\u2019t have to be the woman who comes in wearing the black suit. She doesn\u2019t have to be tough because she can still be feminine and be the boss.\u201d\n\nAnother thing that\u2019s important for Markworth-Pollack and the cast is to celebrate designers of color and emerging brands. \u201cI started out in New York and my BFF and roommate for years was a fashion designer,\u201d the costume designer revealed. \u201cI saw the struggle of it all firsthand and how much it takes, so I love supporting up-and-coming designers. I love the Marc Jacobs and Tom Fords, but I also love newer names. Nathalie also wanted to support Latino designers, as she\u2019s Peruvian and her character Cristal is Venezuelan. Johanna Ortiz and Juan Carlos Obando are in our lineup constantly, as are a couple of Mexican designers whose pieces we\u2019ll be using soon. Nathalie believes that Cristal would be the kind of person who would do that and I agree. She has money now and wants to give back and show that support.\u201d", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6915ab5cf123d4b2f5690bc6/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6915ac4aa508105d994cba65/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/691453d81b0ea780793c5e49/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6855545f9550c207fb02e715/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6912660944b56dadab2b775f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59fc8c9070ae4e37c2ec6434/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/TCDDYNA_EC022.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6914b427f8870d9db8e2a873/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/69134446ee73fee8325f4ebc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6899d36c642fddd1a5723fff/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59fc85e152e9dc2ff73f6eca/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/TCDDYNA_EC025.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6912653d5d66753a47afa79e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6883311cdf45c0ce457bebda/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59fc8d1e545af946d5bbde0d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dynasty-fb.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6915aa984b9564be3d746c01/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/690892896c20c256ee25ca0c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59fc8d1e545af946d5bbde0d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dynasty-fb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Faith Cummings"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/dynasty-cw-fashion-interview-cast-wardrobe-stylist", "title": "Dynasty Fashion: An Interview With the Cast and Wardrobe Stylist", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Faith Cummings", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "In an exclusive interview with the cast and wardrobe stylists, Teen Vogue explores how the new CW show Dynasty is promoting diversity through fashion.", "id": "59f4ab4b2713a8783ea56707", "keywords": "dynasty,meredith markworth-pollack,the cw,elizabeth gillies,rafael de la fuente,nathalie kelly,sam adegoke", "news_keywords": "dynasty,meredith markworth-pollack,the cw,elizabeth gillies,rafael de la fuente,nathalie kelly,sam adegoke", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59f4ab4b2713a8783ea56707", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In an exclusive interview with the cast and wardrobe stylists, Teen Vogue explores how the new CW show Dynasty is promoting diversity through fashion.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59f4ac662713a8783ea56709/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/DYN101b_0175b.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59f4ac662713a8783ea56709/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/DYN101b_0175b.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "'Dynasty' is celebrating diversity through fashion.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59fc8d1e545af946d5bbde0d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dynasty-fb.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "The '80s Version of 'Gossip Girl' Is Back, and Making an Effort to Promote Designers of Color", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/dynasty-cw-fashion-interview-cast-wardrobe-stylist"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-11-03T15:40:34.663Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-03T15:40:34.663Z", "author": "Faith Cummings"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "'Dynasty' is celebrating diversity through fashion.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59fc8d1e545af946d5bbde0d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dynasty-fb.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "The '80s Version of 'Gossip Girl' Is Back, and Making an Effort to Promote Designers of Color"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59fc8d1e545af946d5bbde0d/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/dynasty-fb.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509723634.663, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
