But other than a text here and there, not a lot. If I were to see him at an event like this or wherever, I don\u2019t think it would be weird. I would love to say hello and congratulate him because he\u2019s doing so many great things and kind of catch up. I think what we have going is working, and I think we both wish each other the best.\u201d\n\nBushnell and Higgins got engaged on season 20 of The Bachelor. After the reality dating show was over, Bushnell moved to Denver in April 2016 to be with her fianc\u00e9, and the two starred in a single season of their own own reality network series: Ben and Lauren: Happily Ever After?\n\nThe pair announced their split in May 2017, and Bushnell said it\u2019s been \u201cincredibly bizarre\u201d seeing how much her life has changed just one year later.\n\n\u201cJust looking back at the last few years, it is kind of overwhelming to sit down and think about it, because so much has changed and I\u2019ve been through so much,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had so many highs and so many lows, too. I think that\u2019s what makes life so cool and beautiful, and I\u2019m sure everyone can relate, but it\u2019s interesting to think that it\u2019s already been almost a year. Only like a year ago I was living in Denver, and now I\u2019m back in Los Angeles, which is where I was living, and I feel like finally things have settled for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel far less anxious and more settled and grounded and I feel like I\u2019ve kind of got a little bit more of a hold on my life,\u201d she continued. \u201cFor a while there it felt a little overwhelming so I\u2019m happy and everything\u2019s good.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot going on in her dating life, too. Bushnell has been dating her current boyfriend Devin Antin, a real-estate investor, since at least July 2017. The couple met prior to her stint on The Bachelor and remained friends before turning their relationship romantic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for a while, and obviously things are not perfect all the time, but I think what makes it work is we both are just very similar,\u201d she said. \u201cOur personalities are similar, our senses of humor are similar, and we both have an entrepreneurial mind. He makes me laugh, and we have fun together. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s this perfect recipe for success, but I think if anything, the thing I appreciate most about him is that he is super supportive and he\u2019s always pushing me to do things that maybe I wouldn\u2019t have done, and again, he\u2019s very much always in my corner supporting me.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: Instagram / Lauren Bushnell", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/zach-bryan.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Rumer", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/news/lauren-bushnell-says-theres-no-bad-blood-with-ex-ben-higgins/", "title": "Lauren Bushnell Says There\u2019s \u2018No Bad Blood\u2019 With Ex Ben Higgins One Year After Breakup", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lauren Bushnell Says There's 'No Bad Blood' With Ex Ben Higgins One Year After Breakup", "description": "Lauren Bushnell might not hold any grudges against ex-fianc\u00e9 Ben Higgins, but she says they don\u2019t keep in touch. \u201cI feel like we\u2019re in the same circle ,so obviously I\u2019m sure we both see what the other is doing and are aware of that,\u201d Bushnell, 28, told PEOPLE. \u201cI mean, there\u2019s no bad blood, but [\u2026]", "url": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/news/lauren-bushnell-says-theres-no-bad-blood-with-ex-ben-higgins/", "site_name": "PopCulture.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "width": 640, "height": 320, "type": "image/png"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-15T22:25:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2024-10-07T22:06:56+00:00"}, "author": "Anna Rumer", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Anna Rumer", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/cropped-PopCulture-icon_a9e4e3.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526356800.0, "source": "https://popculture.com", "summary": ""}
