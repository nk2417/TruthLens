This is what you\u2019ve got,\u2019\u201d she said at the conference, according to Billboard. \u201cWe just talk about it. I know it\u2019s really young, but I really believe that if you start this early, there\u2019s no shame.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to tell him, \u2018Keep your private parts,\u2019 and this and that,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful thing. You have it and mine is different and it\u2019s cool, man. We have to respect ourselves and respect each other. So I believe it starts really young.\u201d\n\nBiel\u2019s comments come just after the actress starred in a sex education PSA alongside comedian Chelsea Handler.\n\nThe PSA \u2014 titled \u201cJessica Biel and Chelsea Handler Take a Little Look-See\u201d \u2014 stresses how important it is for women to give themselves regular self-examinations.\n\n\u201cYou have to check in with your vagina! How else do you know what\u2019s going on down there?\u201d Handler instructs in the short clip.\n\n\u201cYou know, sometimes I look at my vagina, and I go, \u2018Wow, that looks like a young, smug Burt Reynolds \u2014 with the mustache,'\u201d Biel says.\n\nThe video was produced by Biel and WomanCare Global for The Tryst Network, a new organization working to \u201cimprove the sexual health IQ of women and their partners through fun, reliable and empowering online content.\u201d\n\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/musk-kelly-kirk-posobiec-split-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/Donald-Trump-3-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/colbert-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/butler-pa-trump-getty-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/54179437886_ca1926f26f_o-e1752809509884-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/AP24149558634342-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/Trump-Eric-Trump-golf-cart-200x150.jpeg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/sept2023-file-Rep-Marjorie-Taylor-Greene-R-GA-MTG-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/trump-pointing-briefing-room-white-house-flickr-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/Bauer-Talks-Lindsey-Graham-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/717-Thumbnail-2-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/trump-in-yet-another-win-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/GettyImages-1248222910-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/GettyImages-902340118-1024x682.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/july11-25-donald-trump-yell-gettyimages-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/Katherine-Maher-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/07/717-Thumbnail-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/10/AP23032794911763-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/06/Child-with-Transgender-Flags-200x150.jpeg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/05/GettyImages-2206442949_-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/02/GettyImages-1253282286-200x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Nussbaum"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/02/08/jessica-biel-starting-sex-ed-lessons-2-year-old-son/", "title": "Jessica Biel Starting Sex Education Lessons with 2-Year-Old Son", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "theme-color": "#FF5500", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The actress says she has already begun teaching her son with singer Justin Timberlake about how to be comfortable with his body.", "title": "Jessica Biel Starting Sex Education Lessons with 2-Year-Old Son", "site": "@BreitbartNews", "image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd.jpg", "creator": "@BreitbartNews"}, "description": "The actress says she has already begun teaching her son with singer Justin Timberlake about how to be comfortable with his body.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jessica Biel Starting Sex Education Lessons with 2-Year-Old Son", "description": "The actress says she has already begun teaching her son with singer Justin Timberlake about how to be comfortable with his body.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/02/08/jessica-biel-starting-sex-ed-lessons-2-year-old-son/", "site_name": "Breitbart", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd.jpg", "width": 447, "height": 335, "alt": "BEVERLY HILLS, CA - JANUARY 07: Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel attend The 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 7, 2018 in Beverly Hills, California.
