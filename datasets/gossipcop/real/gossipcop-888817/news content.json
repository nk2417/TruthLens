They should have ended it this season when they had the chance\u2026 \u2014 Jon Z (@JonZarlengz) May 29, 2018\n\nAndrew Lincoln leaving TWD would be disastrous. Tbf I\u2019d stop watching the show altogether as I can\u2019t see the show going anywhere without him. #thewalkingdead #andrewlincoln \u2014 CRAIG (@Craig14_MUFC) June 1, 2018\n\nSo since Andrew Lincoln is leaving TWD and Rick\u2019s being done dirty, I will give the show a rest and stop watching after S9 \u2014 Zac Annarumma (@_zac15) June 1, 2018\n\n@CoCoMathew, @sunnyclouds_, @AnthonyQuarton\n\nI\u2019m actually glad #AndrewLincoln is evidently leaving #TWD now I can stop watching it!!! ??? \u2014 CoCo?

Killing Carl was bad enough, but now Rick? \u2014 dustin (@Dust103194) May 29, 2018\n\nI know Rick Grimes and everyone on this show has to die \u201ceventually\u201d but we are going on S9, and when basically the main character is done with the show, I think they need to wrap it up and end it how they planned to end it. \u2014 The Walking Dead (@TWDFamilyy) May 29, 2018\n\n@AthosVartis, @_frankiemarrone, @fartoonsprod\n\nAndrew Lincoln leaving The Walking Dead!?I was going to stick with the show, but I\u2019m done. Rick is the absolute center. They would have a very hard time doing it well without him. Season 9 should be the end. It doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re going to end it, but they should. \u2014 Athos Vartis (@AthosVartis) May 29, 2018\n\nThe walking dead is DONE now that Andrew Lincoln is leaving. Ive never been more upset and frustrated \u2014 Frankie (@_frankiemarrone) May 29, 2018\n\nI said from the beginning if Rick Grimes is killed off in The Walking Dead I will quit watching. It appears as though that time has come. It is like losing a best friend. ? But I have to thank Andrew Lincoln for eight glorious seasons. #TWD \u2014 FARToons (Ryan) (@fartoonsprod) May 31, 2018\n\n@Sciles__, @MrsBettieBinx, @infiniteh0rror, @elvenora\n\nWTF Andrew Lincoln is leaving walking dead after season 9 wow well this show is done . It won\u2019t survive without him #TheWalkingDead \u2014 K (@Sciles__) May 29, 2018\n\nIf Andrew Lincoln leaves The Walking Dead, I\u2019m done watching. I\u2019m about done work Fear the Walking Dead too. \u2014 xu\u0131q\u2728\u01dd\u0131\u0287\u0287\u01ddq (@MrsBettieBinx) May 30, 2018\n\nThe Walking Dead needs to quit it with all this moneygrab and next season spoiler bullshit. I get that they know they went far past the point of no return with the show, but this is just excsssive. I hope it ends next season, they\u2019ve just fucked it up too much. \u2014 Meghann \u2728 (@infiniteh0rror) June 1, 2018\n\nThe fact that Andrew Lincoln will quit The Walking Dead, is like the last drop. I really don\u2019t want to watch it anymore. \u2014 Musashi ? (@elvenora) May 30, 2018\n\n@smvkeandmirrors, @MikeDoNot, @EmilyStewart6, @sam_3246\n\nandrew lincoln/rick grimes is the most important person on the walking dead.. idc what you say, there\u2019s no show without him. \u2014 ana (@smvkeandmirrors) May 29, 2018\n\nHonestly, they killed off Carl and Andrew Lincoln is leaving the show. Is there really a point to watching The Walking Dead now? \u2014 Mike Don\u2019t (@MikeDoNot) June 1, 2018\n\nAndrew Lincoln is leaving The Walking Dead so I think I can safely say that I\u2019m done with the show now \u2014 Emily Stewart (@EmilyStewart6) May 29, 2018\n\nWell I think that\u2019s The Walking Dead done with and if not I\u2019m done with it \u2014 Sam (@sam_3246) May 29, 2018\n\nSo #TheWalkingDead killed off Carl, sent Morgan to its spin-off show, wouldn\u2019t pay Lauren Cohan what she deserved, and now reportedly Andrew Lincoln (aka Rick) is leaving after next season. Has AMC royally screwed up or what? \u2014 Bradly Alan (@HereLiesBradly) May 29, 2018\n\n@TWDFamilyy, @DaleDownton, @joesiano24, @lovinglaggie\n\nI love this show SO much. But Andrew Lincoln is THE show. We have been following him since the very first episode. I can\u2019t imagine the show without Rick Grimes. \u2014 The Walking Dead (@TWDFamilyy) May 29, 2018\n\nReportedly, Andrew Lincoln is leaving The Walking Dead after the ninth season. The show is dead. It\u2019s done. It needs to look at the flowers and have a bullet put into its head. \u2014 Kendrick D. Downton (@DaleDownton) May 29, 2018\n\nI think I\u2019m going to give up on the Walking Dead now that Rick Grimes is leaving the show. What\u2019s the point of the show without him? \u2014 J (@joesiano24) June 1, 2018\n\nThe walking dead without them is a show not worth watching. They\u2019re so important. pic.twitter.com/bF0H31WAGZ \u2014 el (@lovinglaggie) May 29, 2018\n\n@sonnaluv76, @ZigZagSwag, @MariamHosny1997, @TheKidT_Webb, @KwikWarren\n\nThe show is nothing without Andrew Lincoln. Not worth watching if Rick Grimes is gone!! He is The STORY of The Walking Dead!!#AndrewLincoln \u2014 SonnaRodrigueZ (@sonnaluv76) May 31, 2018\n\nIf Rick leaves walking dead I\u2019m not watching the show no more \u2014 ZIG (@ZigZagSwag) May 30, 2018\n\nThe Walking Dead without Andy is equal to not having a show. I am not watching TWD after Rick leaves. Bravo. It\u2019s ruined. \u2014 Mariam (@MariamHosny1997) June 1, 2018\n\nThis man Rick Grimes is leaving The Walking Dead. I\u2019m not watching it once he leaves \u2014 Thomas Webb (@TheKidT_Webb) June 1, 2018\n\nIf Andrew Lincoln is leaving The Walking Dead after next season, then next season needs to be the last season of The Walking Dead. End of discussion. That show w/o Rick Grimes is like Batman w/o Bruce Wayne. \u2014 Kenny BooYah! (@KwikWarren) May 29, 2018\n\nSlide 10\n\nif andrew lincoln is really leaving after season nine, then the walking dead should end with season nine. you CAN\u2019T do the walking dead without rick grimes. \u2014 edy (@edylue) May 29, 2018\n\n#TheWalkingDead won\u2019t be the same without Andrew Lincoln/Rick Grimes, I don\u2019t even want to watch the show without him in it. So many of the main cast members are already gone and now Rick! They might as well end the show now. \u2014 Azad (@Azadkhan95) May 29, 2018\n\nAndrew Lincoln (rick) is leaving the walking dead omg,, they might as well end the show because now they don\u2019t even have the Carl story line to follow BECAUSE THEY KILLED HIM \u2014 georgia | 71 (@bearshowell) May 29, 2018\n\nIf Rick leaves #TheWalkingDead. I\u2019m going to stop watching it. Andrew Lincoln IS The Walking Dead!!!! without him the show is nothing! Killing off Carl was one of the worst decisions Scott Gimple ever made.. that\u2019s why Lincoln is leaving. Gimple should be fired! @WalkingDead_AMC \u2014 Rachel Keane (@rachelkeane99) May 30, 2018\n\nCancel walking dead if Andrew lincoln isn\u2019t part of the cast. \u2014 Noah Pascarella (@Noah_bulls1) May 30, 2018\n\nSo yeah. I\u2019m officially finished with The Walking Dead after season 9 (and that\u2019s if I even watch that because there\u2019s a million reasons not to). I love Daryl Dixon as much as the next guy but without Rick and Maggie, it just won\u2019t work for me. They should cancel the show. \u2014 Matt? (@MrWhelan101) May 29, 2018\n\nI kind of lost interest in walking dead during this Negan storyline but Andrew Lincoln leaving in Season 9 does not entice me to start watching again.\n\n\n\nThey pretty much killed off most of the characters I liked anyway or butchered the ones who are still alive into something dumb pic.twitter.com/CavkOGVK3m \u2014 Tommy (@sirtommyguns) May 29, 2018\n\nThe Walking Dead returns this October on AMC.", "images": ["https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/Blooming-Love-Shonen-Jump.jpg?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-KpNhwJ0RxTQPU.gif", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/10/ComicBook-logo_40a31d.png", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/more-recent-sci-fi-movies.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/lego-black-friday.jpeg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/Netflix-Logo-N.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/Dexter-Resurrection-Suit.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/Cartoon-Network-Studios-Logo.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/zodiac-streaming-netflix.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/Ubisoft-Logo.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/themes/comicbook-2024/assets/images/comicbook-logo-white.png", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/eb9b8d3d-fe15-45d5-ab1e-bc17074dabe4.png?w=1200"], "top_img": "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/eb9b8d3d-fe15-45d5-ab1e-bc17074dabe4.png?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cameron Bonomolo", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://comicbook.com/the-walking-dead/news/the-walking-dead-andrew-lincoln-leaving-fans-threaten-stop-watching/", "title": "\u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 Fans Threaten To Stop Watching After Andrew Lincoln Exit", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 Fans Threaten To Stop Watching After Andrew Lincoln Exit", "description": "A subset of Walking Dead fans are taking to social media with threats to stop watching after the looming exit of leading man Andrew Lincoln, who will be departing the zombie drama after eight years as series protagonist Rick Grimes.
