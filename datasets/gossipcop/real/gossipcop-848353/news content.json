Senior royal officer Lord Chamberlain and private secretary Sir Christopher Geidt are expected to address staff, but the subject of that meeting is currently unknown.\n\n\"Although meetings involving the entire royal household are occasionally called, the way this has been done at the eleventh hour is highly unusual and suggests that there is something major to be disseminated,\" a source told the Daily Mail. \"But at the moment, only those closest to her genuinely know what on earth this is all about.\"\n\nThe Queen, who turned 91 last month, was recently in the public eye when she met with British prime minister Theresa May to mark the dissolution of Parliament due to the general election. She and Prince Philip, who will turn 96 in June, just returned to the palace after celebrating a long Easter holiday.", "images": ["https://www.12news.com/assets/shared-images/icons/close-menu.svg", "https://www.12news.com/assets/shared-images/logos/amp/KPNX.png", "https://media.12news.com/assets/KPNX/images/f7f7aae1-2c39-451d-a7b5-58dde0796a0a/20251120T154051/f7f7aae1-2c39-451d-a7b5-58dde0796a0a_360x203.jpg", "https://media.12news.com/assets/KPNX/images/a48c8f76-2d24-47c3-8583-000836a5829e/20251120T114103/a48c8f76-2d24-47c3-8583-000836a5829e_360x203.jpg", "https://media.12news.com/assets/KPNX/images/ce259503-a385-47d5-a5e4-253bd68c8b61/20250114T201216/ce259503-a385-47d5-a5e4-253bd68c8b61_360x203.jpg", "https://www.12news.com/assets/shared-images/weather-icons/partly-cloudy-night_210x210.png", "https://media.12news.com/assets/WXIA/images/436632562/436632562_1x1.jpg", "https://www.12news.com/assets/shared-images/icons/badge-google-play.svg", "https://media.12news.com/assets/KPNX/images/ae75175e-8f92-419f-8c93-f875d69ceaa5/20251008T153814/ae75175e-8f92-419f-8c93-f875d69ceaa5_360x203.jpg", "https://media.12news.com/assets/WXIA/images/436632562/436632562_750x422.jpg", "https://media.12news.com/assets/KPNX/images/dacd9043-272d-4d42-995a-2ea5e8e11c50/20251121T003746/dacd9043-272d-4d42-995a-2ea5e8e11c50_1920x1080.jpg", "http://www.11alive.com/img/resize/content.11alive.com/photo/2017/05/04/GettyImages-653741242_1493871594402_9369894_ver1.0.jpg", "https://media.12news.com/assets/KPNX/images/f12d56a9-39bc-4ab7-aed0-77821276e87f/20250819T024108/f12d56a9-39bc-4ab7-aed0-77821276e87f_360x203.jpg", "https://www.12news.com/assets/shared-images/logos/native/kpnx.svg", "https://www.12news.com/assets/shared-images/icons/facebook.svg", "https://media.12news.com/assets/KPNX/images/ce945339-4b3a-4401-af03-fc72aa5eab1c/20250519T233536/ce945339-4b3a-4401-af03-fc72aa5eab1c_360x203.jpg", "https://media.12news.com/assets/WXIA/images/436632562/436632562_1140x641.jpg", "https://www.12news.com/assets/shared-images/icons/badge-app-store.svg", "https://www.12news.com/assets/shared-images/logos/kpnx.png"], "top_img": "https://media.12news.com/assets/WXIA/images/436632562/436632562_1140x641.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.12news.com/article/news/reports-royal-staff-called-for-emergency-meeting-at-buckingham-palace/85-436630269", "title": "Reports: Royal staff called for emergency meeting at Buckingham palace", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#045ea8", "category": "news", "og": {"url": "https://www.12news.com/article/news/reports-royal-staff-called-for-emergency-meeting-at-buckingham-palace/85-436630269", "title": "Reports: Royal staff called for emergency meeting at Buckingham palace", "description": "The way the emergency meeting was called is said to be \"highly unusual:\"", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.12news.com/assets/WXIA/images/436632562/436632562_1140x641.jpg", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "5/4/2017 6:37:51 AM"}, "site_name": "12news.com", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "section": "12news,news"}, "twitter": {"title": "Reports: Royal staff called for emergency meeting at Buckingham palace", "image": "https://media.12news.com/assets/WXIA/images/436632562/436632562_1140x641.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "12News", "description": "The way the emergency meeting was called is said to be \"highly unusual:\"", "domain": "www.12news.com/"}, "viewport": "width=1170", "site": "12news.com", "description": "<p>The way the emergency meeting was called is said to be \"highly unusual:\"</p>", "fb": {"app_id": 139810620033253}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493894271.0, "source": "https://www.12news.com", "summary": ""}
