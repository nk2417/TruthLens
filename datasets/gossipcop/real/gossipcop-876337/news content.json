The 41-year-old actress and co-founder of The Honest Company is known for her flawless, dewy complexion, but she actually has her share of skin concerns, just like the rest of us.\n\n\u201cOne of them is my dry, flaky skin. I can get quite rashy and I have pretty sensitive skin. So I try to avoid anything that will give me that eczema-type rash. And then the other thing is congestion\u2014having underground clogged pores and blackheads.\u201d1\n\nDealing with these challenges over the years was why she turned to clean beauty. \u201cAll of the skincare products that I use are clean, and why I\u2019m so passionate about it is because I\u2019ve had such reactive skin literally since I was born. I thought I had chronic cystic acne when I was in my twenties, but what I realized is I\u2019m just allergic to a lot of petroleum-based ingredients, and I\u2019m also allergic to synthetic fragrances.\u201d2,3\n\nNow, Jessica\u2019s skincare routine is mostly her own Honest products. (\u201cIt\u2019s the only way that I can ensure that I\u2019m not going to have some kind of reaction.\u201d4) She also uses an array of skin gadgets and face masks, and has regular treatments with her esthetician (and BFF) Shani Darden.\n\nReady to see which treatments keep her complexion calm, clear, and glowing? Read on.\n\nJessica Alba at the 2021 Baby2Baby Gala. Xavier Collin/Image Press Agency/ImageCollect\n\nHer Morning Skincare Routine\n\n1. Face Mask\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Prime + Perfect Mask: \u201cEvery morning, I use our Prime + Perfect Mask. I just wake up and throw it on my face! It\u2019s like a smoothie but for your skin, and it\u2019s packed with antioxidants. I love this mask because it makes my skin just look tighter and brighter. I feel like my pores look smaller, and it smells so good\u2014mmm, like berries. And it has shea butter in it, so it\u2019s really moisturizing and soft.\u201d\n\n2. Eye and Lip Balm\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Magic Beauty Balm: \u201cThen I use Magic Balm. It can go everywhere, but I put it on my lips, my eyelids and under my eyes. Now I let it sit for 10 minutes.\u201d\n\n3. Konjac Sponge\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Gentle Konjac Sponge: \u201cI love to take [the face mask] off with a sponge. I feel like the sponge also gives me a little bit of exfoliation.\u201d\n\n4. Serums\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Calm & POREfect Serum: \u201cI\u2019ll use a warm washcloth to take the mask off, and then, I follow it up with our Calm & POREfect Serum.\u201d\n\niS Clinical\n\niS Clinical Active Serum: \u201cI have a brilliant facialist called Shani Darden, who looks after my skin. She recommended iS Clinical Active Serum and said it would stop me from getting wrinkles and breakouts. And she was right\u2014I haven\u2019t broken out during this pregnancy and I\u2019ve noticed the fine lines starting to go away.\u201d\n\n5. Moisturizers\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Hydrogel Cream: \u201cThen, I use the Hydrogel Cream during the day. I love this because this is over 70% water. It instantly hydrates your face and your face looks like it just took a big drink of water. It absorbs quickly.\u201d\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Deep Hydration Face Cream: \u201cSo I\u2019ll usually use the Deep Hydration Face Cream, and do a squirt of that.\u201d\n\n6. Balm/Face Oil\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Calm & Heal Melting Balm: \u201cAnd a nice scoop of the new Calm & Heal Melting Balm. I love rubbing it into my hands, and then, once it melts and transforms, I press it into my face and my neck. There\u2019s this face cream, the fanciest I\u2019ve ever used, that\u2019s popular in Hollywood, but it\u2019s so expensive. Anytime I got the opportunity to use the cream, I loved the immediate effects of it, but then I would break out because it would clog my pores. I asked my chemist in-house, \u2018Can we make something that has similar skincare benefits and texture, but without the 2,500 ingredients that we\u2019re not using in our products?\u2019\u201d\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Organic Beauty Facial Oil: \u201c[In colder weather,] I\u2019ll add the Organic Facial Oil for my daytime routine as well, not just at night. I love the texture of this oil because it\u2019s not heavy. It actually just melts and blends right into your skin\u2026 you can wear it over makeup or under makeup. You can even mix it with your makeup if you want that barely there bare skin look.\u201d\n\n7. Eye Cream\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Honestly Bright Eyes Tinted Eye Cream: \u201cNext, I\u2019ll apply the Honestly Bright Eyes Tinted Eye Cream\u2014it has this great hydrogel base with pigment, and it just counters the blue from my dark circles.\u201d\n\n8. Sunscreen\n\nHonest\n\nHonest CCC Clean Corrective with Vitamin C Tinted Moisturizer SPF 30: \u201cThen I go in with the CCC; it\u2019s like an SPF, like a tinted moisturizer. It\u2019s like makeup with skincare benefits. It can replace foundation and it helps block out blue light and UV rays, especially with all the exposure to our screens. Ours is great for indoors or outdoors. It\u2019s a nice, light coverage that you can layer.\u201d\n\n9. Lip Balms\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Magic Beauty Balm: \u201cThis is such a great product because you can put it on your lips, at the top of your cheekbones, and I like to put it down the bridge of my nose. And I\u2019ll even do a quick glossy lid with it.\u201d\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Gloss-C Lip Gloss: \u201cAnd then, I use our Gloss-C Lip Gloss\u2014it\u2019s like a gloss and lip treatment in one.\u201d\n\n10. Face Mist\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Elevated Hydration Mist: \u201cI always finish everything off with the Elevated Hydration Mist. It\u2019s like an instant spa treatment all the time.\u201d\n\nHer Evening Skincare Routine\n\n1. Headband\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Fuzzy Headband: \u201cFirst, a headband. It\u2019s cute. I always pull my hair back because, you know, I would say that I\u2019m kinda messy when it comes to my skincare.\u201d\n\n2. Konjac Sponge\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Gentle Konjac Sponge: \u201cI like to do just a good wipe down of the face, sort of like wiping away the day.\u201d\n\n3. Cleansers\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Magic Gel-To-Milk Makeup Melting Cleanser: \u201cI do like to double cleanse when I\u2019m wearing more of a glam face. So the first one is a gel-to-milk, and what\u2019s nice is it just sort of breaks down all of the makeup. But because it\u2019s made with more natural ingredients, it doesn\u2019t sting my eyes. There\u2019s no perfume, no fragrance. It sort of transforms when you add water and you can see it gets sort of milky.\u201d\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Calm On Foaming Cream Cleanser: \u201cNext\u2026 I\u2019m gonna use Calm On Foaming Cleanser by Honest Beauty, and you could really just use this. I usually just use this one every single day and it does break down makeup. But like I said, for those heavier makeup days, I do like to double cleanse.\u201d\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Gentle Gel Cleanser: \u201cI\u2019ll double cleanse using the Gentle Gel Cleanser because I like my skin to feel squeaky clean. [This] doesn\u2019t overly dry the skin. It\u2019s great for everyone\u2014[my daughter] Honor uses it, I use it, [my husband] Cash uses it. [My daughter] Haven even uses it.\u201d\n\n4. Serums\n\nShani Darden\n\nShani Darden Retinol Reform: \u201cI started using [retinol] after I had my first daughter\u2014I don\u2019t use it when I\u2019m pregnant. It takes away fine lines, it takes away spots and makes the texture of my skin better. Finding a formula that isn\u2019t too drying is the key. Mine is a lotion called Retinol Reform\u2014my facialist makes it and she ships it all over the world. It\u2019s the best because it doesn\u2019t overly dry your skin, which is usually the case with retinol. As I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve found that I don\u2019t have as many fine lines and wrinkles as someone my age might, and I definitely credit this to my consistent use of retinol over time.\u201d\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Vitamin C Radiance Serum: \u201cNow that my face is dry and cleansed, I\u2019m going to go in with vitamin C. What I love about this vitamin C is that it actually has two hyaluronic acids with it. So it brightens your skin without drying your skin out.\u201d\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Beauty Sleep Resurfacing Serum: \u201cI apply Beauty Sleep Resurfacing Serum about three times a week. It works overnight to dissolve away dead skin cells, leaving me with refreshed, glowy skin. Literally I feel like in one night you can see such a difference. So I don\u2019t know if you all have like blackheads on your nose or congestion, but in seven days of using this every night, it\u2019s a dramatic difference. It\u2019s recommended that you can use it once a week after that, or you could use it every day. It\u2019s really whatever is your jam.\u201d\n\n5. Moisturizer\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Hydrogel Cream: \u201cThe Hydrogel is amazing. It\u2019s life-changing. Anyone that tries it is like, \u2018Oh my God!\u2019 because you don\u2019t rub it all the way, and you leave that little bit of a layer. It has this time-release moisturizer kind of vibe. And if you want to rub it in right away and get it into your skin, it\u2019s very watery, and it feels very refreshing. It\u2019s like your face instantly drinks up that hydration. It\u2019s not greasy. It\u2019s not oily. It\u2019s not super heavy. Letting it sit on the face for like 10 minutes makes a world of difference.\u201d\n\n6. Face Oil/Balm\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Organic Beauty Facial Oil: \u201cAt night, I like to combine the Organic Facial Oil and the Hydrogel Cream. This is great for all skin types. It smells really nice.\u201d\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Calm & Heal Melting Balm: \u201cAt night, I\u2019ll use the Calm & Heal Melting Balm.\u201d\n\n7. Eye Cream\n\nHonest\n\nHonest Calm & Renew Melting Eye Balm: \u201cAnd then I\u2019ll use the Calm & Renew Eye Balm around my eyes.\u201d\n\n8. Lip Scrub\n\nFresh\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m really trying to do the most for myself, I\u2019ll go in with a lip scrub and really go to town.\u201d\n\n9. Lip Balm\n\nDr. Barbara Sturm\n\nDr. Barbara Sturm Lip Balm: \u201cAnd then a really luxurious lip butter and layer that on. What\u2019s nice is if you put it on right before you sleep, I feel like it just sort of penetrates.\u201d\n\nHer Skincare Treatments\n\nFace Mask\n\nHonest\n\nHonest 3-in-1 Detox Mud Mask: \u201cI do a lot of face masks with my daughters, at least two or three times a week. I like to use the Detox Mask to combat congestion. My daughter Honor, who\u2019s a tween, has more of that hormonal kind of skin right now, so she does really well with the Detox Mask, too. A lot of these activated charcoal masks can be quite drying, and I wanted to create one that just doesn\u2019t really overly dry your skin.\u201d\n\nEye Masks\n\nComfort Zone\n\nComfort Zone Sublime Skin Eye Patch: \u201cThis I actually discovered when I was in Italy. We launched Honest Beauty at Douglas in Italy and when I was there, we went to a bunch of cities and my makeup artist discovered this amazing brand. Literally, my eyes react to so many things and these are the only patches that I can use that I haven\u2019t had a reaction to. I wish they were cheaper!\u201d\n\nJoanna Vargas\n\nJoanna Vargas Bright Eye Firming Mask: \u201cThese are fantastic because they\u2019re so compact, and they\u2019re this jelly texture. They\u2019re very hydrating and they just feel really cooling and good underneath the eyes. You leave it on for 10 minutes and it really kind of penetrates. It takes down the appearance of crow\u2019s feet and just makes me feel more bright and awake. I\u2019ll even put this on when I\u2019m flying on the plane. The person next to me usually thinks I\u2019m crazy.\u201d\n\nLight Therapy\n\nShani Darden by D\u00e9esse PRO\n\nShani Darden by D\u00e9esse PRO LED Light Mask: \u201cMy girlfriend, Shani Darden, she\u2019s a facialist, and she just came out with this LED light mask that has a neck component, and that\u2019s pretty dope. And when you\u2019re my age, you appreciate the neck.\u201d\n\nSculpting Tool\n\nShani Darden\n\nShani Darden Facial Sculpting Wand: \u201cMy friend Shani Darden just came out with this Facial Sculpting Wand that I love.\u201d\n\nFacial Rollers/Massagers\n\nNurse Jamie\n\nNurse Jamie NuVibe RX Amethyst Massaging Beauty Tool: \u201cI like to use this little device. It basically just gets the blood flowing.\u201d\n\nReFa\n\nReFa Carat Ray Face & Body Roller: \u201cIt\u2019s called ReFa. I actually don\u2019t know any of the technical aspects of it. All I know is that my girlfriend, Monika Blunder, who is a makeup artist, she got this for me as a gift, and I don\u2019t know, it just feels fancy. As you can see, I got these rosy cheeks now.\u201d\n\nNurse Jamie\n\nNurse Jamie UpLift Facial Massaging Beauty Roller: \u201cOne last piece of the puzzle to get the circulation going is I like to use this tool. I don\u2019t really know if I\u2019m doing it right, but I feel like I might be. I just feel like it kind of gives you those cheekbones and under here gets rid of that double chin that you don\u2019t want. That\u2019s all that blood circulating.\u201d\n\nNurse Jamie\n\nNurse Jamie Eyeonix Eye Massaging Beauty Tool: \u201cIt\u2019s called Eyeonix, and it just sort of like vibrates\u2026 and it just feels really good on the face, especially after a long day. It feels like you\u2019re really massaging. It\u2019s like, how do I take the best part of a facial and bring it into my daily routine? Yes, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend doing it on a dry face. I think you really need to have product to help move around without pulling your skin under your eyes.\u201d\n\nFacials\n\nShani Darden: \u201cWhen I became a mom, and I stopped acting full time\u2026 they say that your daughters take your beauty away from you. Well, they did! So I cried a lot, and I became best friends with my esthetician, \u2018cause I basically saw her every other day. Anytime I leave, it\u2019s weird, with her I look better. Because you know how sometimes you get facials, you look a little busted after? Go to Shani, you look better. She was the first facialist that actually made me look better right after my appointment. You usually look crazy after a facial, and need three days for your skin to calm down. That doesn\u2019t happen with Shani.\u201d\n\nTraci Martyn: \u201cWhen I\u2019m in New York, I\u2019ll see Tracie Martyn for facials. She uses this zappy electric current thing that makes my skin feel really tight after. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nDermatologist\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have a regular dermatologist. I probably should! I feel like I really should. I am not afraid to use a skin tightening laser. Bring it! I am not afraid to use an IPL. Bring it!\u201d\n\nHer Diet, Exercise & Lifestyle\n\nDiet\n\n\u201cI really think [clear skin] has to do with nutrition. Staying away from refined sugars as much as you can, and carbohydrates\u2014going for more complex carbohydrates. Having a balanced diet, having as much fresh produce as possible. Not as much processed food. And really eliminating fried foods.\u201d\n\nNutritionist\n\nKelly LeVeque: \u201cMy go-to nutritional guru is Kelly LeVeque, so I always turn to her for advice.\u201d\n\nHydration\n\n\u201cI drink coconut water and I drink a ton of water. It\u2019s not just putting hydration on the [outside], it\u2019s also about the health of your skin inside. I think staying hydrated is really important\u2026 for glowing skin and high energy. [Dehydration] shows on the outside. As you get older, you really see it on your face.\u201d\n\nSupplements\n\n\u201cDefinitely consult your doctor, but I do think taking a high-quality DHA is really helpful, and I am an advocate for probiotics and having a good multivitamin on hand. I also love prenatals. They\u2019re packed with all kinds of vitamins to help grow a baby, and any time I\u2019ve taken them, whether I was pregnant or not or trying to get pregnant or not, I\u2019ve found that everything just looks more glowy and vibrant. I also like to put collagen in my coffee in the morning, or I\u2019ll use a protein powder with collagen if I\u2019m making a smoothie. I take a hyaluronic acid supplement as well.\u201d\n\nSleep\n\n\u201cSleeping and eating right is more important than you think. I didn\u2019t sleep at all in my 20s. I worked so much. I [still] don\u2019t sleep as much as I\u2019d like, but I don\u2019t know if anybody does. I really want eight hours of sleep at night, but I just don\u2019t get it.\u201d\n\nExercise\n\n\u201c[After] breakfast\u2026 I do try to do some movement, whether it\u2019s yoga or spinning. We converted our garage to a gym, and there\u2019s a bunch of workout apps.\u201d\n\nMeditation\n\nHeadspace: \u201cI like to listen to meditations. I did TM [transcendental meditation] but I find it\u2019s kind of tough to meditate on your own\u2014for me\u2014so I like Headspace. And you can do five-minute meditations, 10-minute mediations\u2026 and you can go to whatever it is you\u2019re dealing with. It\u2019s pretty dope.\u201d\n\nAttitude\n\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve really grown to love who I\u2019ve become and who I\u2019ve turned into. I don\u2019t have the same fullness in my face that I had when I was younger, but I\u2019m okay with having more angles. I\u2019m okay with waking up and seeing this person that I am today because it represents the comfort and the confidence and the life experience that comes with aging\u2014there\u2019s just an ease now. When I was younger, I was always in my head, and I was so insecure. I was worried about such silly things that, at the end of the day, mean absolutely nothing. I wasn\u2019t living in the moment. I didn\u2019t have the same quality of life when I was younger as I do now. I had more collagen and fluffier cheeks and no pores, and my cellulite wasn\u2019t as dominant\u2026 I didn\u2019t have stretch marks on my boobs, and yet I was still so insecure about every little thing, you know? I never just enjoyed and lived in the moment, and now, it\u2019s just like whatever! Let me live!\u201d\n\nMore Celebrity Skincare\n\nFor more celebrity skincare, check out these celebrity skincare routines and discover the top skincare products that celebrities always
