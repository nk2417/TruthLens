Now, four years after the original was released, a new champion arises to protect and defend Wakanda in the latest installment, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\nEli Ad\u00e9 Danai Gurira and Angela Bassett in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\nWith a cast comprised mainly of people of color, including actors Angela Bassett, Lupita Nyong'o, Letitia Wright, Danai Gurira, Dominique Thorne, Winston Duke, and Michaela Coel, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a celebration of the multi-faceted nature of Black and Brown beauty. Celebrity hairstylist Camille Friend and makeup artist to the stars Joel Harlow helmed the beauty looks seen in the new film, which were largely based on a combination of Mayan and African cultures.\n\nAhead of its highly anticipated release, Friend and Harlow share an inside scoop on how their creative vision for Black Panther: Wakanda Forever came to life, their short list of on-set holy-grail products, and the most challenging part about executing these otherworldly hair and makeup designs.\n\nHow are the hair looks in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever similar or different from the ones seen in the first film?\n\nCamille Friend: The common thread from the first Black Panther to Wakanda Forever is that Black hair is beautiful. In Wakanda Forever the hair designs are establishing the passage of time and the death of T\u2019Challa.\n\nJoel Harlow: The makeup looks in Wakanda Forever are similar in overall approach to the looks seen in the first film. We didn\u2019t want to stray into looks that were too different because the looks we already established resonated so strongly with the fans. However, they do differ from the first film in technical methodology. The looks also differ with character evolvement and change to reflect the current state and age of each character. Additionally, we also got the opportunity to expand our work with the introduction of the new Talokan civilization and the Midnight Angels.\n\nMarvel Studios Angela Bassett as Ramonda in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\nWhat\u2019s a beauty product that was used on set our readers would be surprised to find out about/wouldn\u2019t expect?\n\nCF: Here are some of my favorite beauty products that were used in the movie:\n\nJH: Probably the most unexpected product wasn\u2019t a \u201cproduct\u201d at all. It was more of a tool. The airbrush. The Talokanil appear blue when out of the water. The airbrush was instrumental in translating natural tones of the blue skin into what was essentially beauty makeup for our lead Talokan females. In addition to the blue skin tones, we also created facial jewelry and respirators for them once they are on dry land. All of these began as sculpted augmentations. They were ultimately transformed into silicone prosthetics finessed with dozens of layers of paint to achieve a realistic jade look. Everything was designed to accentuate the beauty and strength of our characters.\n\nMarvel Studios\n\nFor the scenes that incorporate tribal-style hair what were some of your references/inspirations in the creation of these looks?\n\nCF: For the Talokanil tribe, I designed the looks based on Mesoamerica and Mayan culture. We did research and spoke with a Professor of Mayan studies. I took great care in designing the looks for the Mayan culture; I always wanted the movie to be culturally correct. Also, for the Jabari tribe, I was inspired by Senegalese warrior looks.\n\nJH: The inspiration was nothing more or less than the cultural looks of the various tribes of Africa. Taking these looks and exploring what they would evolve into given the introduction of vibranium is what resulted in the looks in the film. The main reference used was the two volume book . Thais and the costumes were a big part of our inspiration.\n\nMarvel Studios\n\nHow important was it to illustrate a wide variety of natural hair looks\u2014from close cuts to braids and locs\u2014on characters throughout the film?\n\nCF: The representation of all hair types and textures is most important in the hairstory of the film. Wakanda Forever showcases \u201cBlack hairstyling\u201d from traditional to modern trends. We have covered all of the culturally \u201cBlack hairstyles\u201d in both movies.\n\nAnnette Brown Michaela Coel as Aneka in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\nEli Ad\u00e9 Dominique Thorne as Riri in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Annette Brown Letitia Wright as Shuri in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\nCould you explain how some of the characters\u2019 hair stylings (bold vs. more natural) translate to their overall personalities or roles in the movie?\n\nCF: When designing the looks for actors, you always want your actor to be confident in the look. When the actor is confident in their look, it is the best feeling. Many actors rely on hair and makeup to transform themselves into their characters. In some cases, it\u2019s the absence of hair that makes a bold statement, for instance the Dora Milaje are fierce warrior women that have no hair.\n\nJH: Natural looks with the characters of Shuri and Riri, reflect their youth. Okoye, Ayo, Aneka, and the Dora Milaje have bold strong looks to reflect their strength and power. M\u2019Baku\u2019s bushy facial hair and tattoos are examples of the Jabari tribe. Namor is a variation of his look in the comic books but incorporates his culture with the addition of his jewelry and costume. Attuma is a warrior, his look personifies this. He is branded on his torso with a representation of shark teeth. His face is also pierced with smaller shark teeth. Namora, she is beautiful and strong, and her makeup reflects this quality.\n\nEli Ad\u00e9 Winston Duke as M\u2019Baku in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\nHow was hair and makeup used to illustrate the evolution of these characters?\n\nCF: In Wakanda Forever, we use hair to show the passage of time. The character evolved from the first movie through a change of style, cutting, color, and texture. For instance, we see Nakia (Lupita Nyong\u2019o) has grown her hair out into locs from the short bantu knots from the first film.\n\nJW: We used makeup to evolve with each character by their current state and development within the film. We start this journey from a place of celebratory mourning for the loss of T\u2019Challa and the makeup choices take this into account. As we continue, and Wakanda is threatened by an outside civilization, we are afforded the chance play with looks that speak to the strength of Wakanda and its people and leaders.\n\nMarvel Studios Lupita Nyong\u2019o as Nakia in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\nWhose look was the most difficult to achieve, and why?\n\nCF: The Talokanil hairstyle isn\u2019t difficult to achieve with a great hair team, but it was challenging to maintain hairstyles underwater. The wigs and hairpieces took a real beating being in the water for 10 hours a day.\n\nJH: All of the Talokanil. Their \u201csurface\u201d makeup application took roughly three hours each. This included full body paint makeup, prosthetic gills and facial and neck prosthetic \u201crebreathers,\" and digitally created ear jewelry painted to appear like blue jade.\n\nEli Ad\u00e9 Tenoch Huerta Mej\u00eda as Namor in Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\n\nBlack Panther: Wakanda Forever opens in theaters on November 11, 2022.\n\n\n\n", "images":
