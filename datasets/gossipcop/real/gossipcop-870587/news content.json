For the eponymous character, see Sheldon Cooper\n\nYoung Sheldon is an American sitcom television series created by Chuck Lorre and Steven Molaro which aired on CBS from September 25, 2017, to May 16, 2024. The series is a spin-off prequel to The Big Bang Theory that takes place during the late 1980s and early-to-mid-1990s, and follows child prodigy Sheldon Cooper as he grows up with his family in East Texas. Iain Armitage stars as Sheldon, alongside Zoe Perry, Lance Barber, Montana Jordan, Raegan Revord, and Annie Potts. Jim Parsons, who portrayed the adult Sheldon Cooper on The Big Bang Theory, narrated the series and served as an executive producer.\n\nDevelopment of the prequel series began in November 2016, from an initial idea that Parsons passed along to The Big Bang Theory producers. The following March, Armitage and Perry were cast, and the series was ordered by CBS. Young Sheldon premiered as a special preview on September 25, 2017, and was picked up for a full season that began airing weekly on November 2, 2017. In November 2023, CBS announced that the series would end after its seventh season.[3] The one-hour series finale aired on May 16, 2024.[4] The series received positive reviews from critics.\n\nIn January 2024, it was announced that a spin-off series focused on Georgie Cooper and Mandy McAllister was in development. In March 2024, CBS greenlit the series, titled Georgie & Mandy's First Marriage. The first episode was broadcast on October 17, 2024.[5]\n\nPlot\n\nSeasons 1\u20133 (1989\u20131991)\n\nThe series opens in fall 1989 with nine-year-old Sheldon Cooper beginning high school at Medford High School in East Texas. As a child prodigy with an exceptional intellect, Sheldon struggles to fit in socially while excelling academically.[6] His family dynamics are central to early storylines: his devoutly religious mother Mary often clashes with his scientific skepticism, while his father George Sr. attempts to understand his son despite their intellectual differences. Sheldon's relationship with his twin sister Missy is characterized by typical sibling rivalry, though they maintain a close bond, while his older brother Georgie often feels overshadowed by the attention Sheldon receives.\n\nThroughout these seasons, Sheldon begins his college education by auditing physics classes taught by Dr. John Sturgis at East Texas Tech.[7] His grandmother Constance (also known as Connie and Meemaw), who calls him \"Moonpie,\" serves as one of his strongest advocates and begins a romantic relationship with Dr. Sturgis. The family faces various challenges, including financial struggles and George Sr.'s demanding coaching schedule. Sheldon's social development is explored through his friendship with Tam Nguyen, a Vietnamese-American classmate who introduces him to comic books and role-playing games.[8] The series also introduces Paige Swanson, another child prodigy who serves as both a friend and academic rival to Sheldon.\n\nSeasons 4\u20135 (1991\u20131993)\n\nAs Sheldon graduates high school at age eleven as valedictorian, he transitions to full-time college attendance at East Texas Tech in fall 1991.[9] The series explores more complex family dynamics and character development during this period. Dr. Sturgis experiences a mental health crisis that strains his relationship with Meemaw and temporarily disrupts Sheldon's academic progress. George Sr. faces increasing pressure as head football coach while dealing with marital tensions with Mary, who becomes attracted to a younger pastor at their church. These developments create emotional turmoil within the Cooper household.\n\nGeorgie begins showing signs of maturity as he enters his late teens, though he continues to struggle academically and eventually drops out of high school at age seventeen to work full-time.[10] His decision creates family conflict but also demonstrates his natural sales abilities. Meanwhile, Missy navigates typical adolescent challenges while maintaining her role as Sheldon's emotional anchor. Sheldon's college experience introduces new challenges as he encounters peers and professors who don't always accommodate his unique personality and needs. During this period, Georgie meets Mandy McAllister, about 12 years older than he is, and their relationship becomes serious despite the significant age difference.[10]\n\nSeasons 6\u20137 (1993\u20131994)\n\nThe final seasons focus on major life transitions and family upheaval as the series approaches its conclusion. Georgie's relationship with Mandy becomes central to the family's story when she becomes pregnant with his child. The couple eventually marries, and Mandy gives birth to their daughter Constance, nicknamed \"CeeCee\" after Meemaw, in early 1993. This development forces both Georgie and the Cooper family to confront adult responsibilities and consequences.[11][12]\n\nGeorge Sr.'s health becomes a growing concern throughout the seventh season. The family deals with various stressors, including the aftermath of a tornado that forces extended family members to temporarily live together. George Sr. receives an offer for a prestigious coaching position at Rice University in Houston, which would require the family to relocate. However, before he can accept the opportunity, George Sr. suffers a fatal heart attack while at work in season seven, episode twelve. The off-screen death occurs as the family waits for him to return home for a planned family photograph, leaving Mary, Meemaw, and the children to cope with the sudden loss.[13]\n\nThe series concludes with Sheldon's academic achievements leading to his acceptance at the California Institute of Technology for graduate studies. At age fourteen, he makes the difficult decision to leave his grieving family in Texas and move to California to pursue his scientific career.[14] The finale depicts adult Sheldon composing his childhood memoir and reflecting on the past, with appearances from his wife Amy and allusions to their children, providing closure to Sheldon's formative years while connecting to his future as established in The Big Bang Theory.\n\nCast and characters\n\nMain\n\nRecurring\n\nGuest\n\nOriginal cast cameos\n\nEpisodes\n\nProduction\n\nDevelopment\n\nIn November 2016, it was reported that CBS was in negotiations to create a spin-off of The Big Bang Theory centered on Sheldon Cooper as a young boy. The prequel series, described as \"a Malcolm in the Middle-esque single-camera family comedy\" would be executive produced by The Big Bang Theory co-creator Chuck Lorre and producer Steven Molaro, with The Big Bang Theory co-creator Bill Prady expected to be involved in some capacity, and intended to air in the 2017\u201318 season alongside The Big Bang Theory.[39][40] The initial idea for the series came from Jim Parsons (who portrays the adult Sheldon on The Big Bang Theory), who passed it along to The Big Bang Theory producers.[19] On March 13, 2017, CBS ordered the spin-off Young Sheldon series, which was created by Lorre and Molaro. Jon Favreau directed and executive produced the pilot. Parsons, Lorre, Molaro and Todd Spiewak also serve as executive producers on the series, for Chuck Lorre Productions and Warner Bros. Television.[15] On September 27, 2017, CBS picked up the series for a full season of 22 episodes.[41] On January 6, 2018, the show was renewed for a second season, which premiered on September 24 of that same year.[42][43]\n\nOn February 22, 2019, CBS renewed the series for both a third and a fourth season.[44] The third season premiered on September 26, 2019.[45] Warner Bros. Television suspended production on March 13, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving the third season with only 21 episodes.[46] Production for the fourth season began on September 22, 2020, and premiered on November 5, 2020.[47] Production for the fourth season concluded on March 15, 2021.[48]\n\nOn March 30, 2021, CBS renewed the series for a fifth, sixth, and seventh season.[49] The fifth season premiered on October 7, 2021.[50] The sixth season premiered on September 29, 2022.[51] The seventh season was on hold due to 2023 Writers Guild of America strike. In October of that year, writing resumed when the strike ended.[52] The seventh and final season premiered on February 15, 2024.[53] On November 14, 2023, CBS announced that the series would end after seven seasons,[3] with the series finale airing on May 16, 2024. The final season consisted of a total of 14 episodes,[55] and it finished filming on April 16, 2024.[56]\n\nCasting\n\nIn early March 2017, Iain Armitage was cast as the younger Sheldon, and Zoe Perry as his mother, Mary Cooper. Perry is the real-life daughter of Laurie Metcalf, who portrays Mary Cooper on The Big Bang Theory.[19] Lance Barber stars as George Cooper Sr., Sheldon's father; he had previously appeared in one episode of The Big Bang Theory.[57] Raegan Revord stars as Missy Cooper, Sheldon's twin sister; Revord only got the part after repeatedly asking her mother to be allowed to read for the role.[58] The show also stars Montana Jordan as George Cooper Jr., Sheldon's older brother. Jim Parsons reprises his role as adult Sheldon Cooper, as narrator for the series. In July 2017, Annie Potts was cast as Meemaw, Sheldon's grandmother.[21] In March 2024, it was announced that Jim Parsons and Mayim Bialik will guest star on the series finale as their original characters from The Big Bang Theory. [59]\n\nOverlap with the parent series\n\nJim Parsons provides voiceover for the series. In the Season 4 episode \"Graduation\", Mayim Bialik (as Amy, the wife of adult Sheldon) has a brief voice-over role while Sheldon describes the graduation party for their son Leonard, whom he reveals was named after Leonard Hofstadter and Leonard Nimoy. Amy and Sheldon make their only on-camera appearances together during the series finale in the office of their Pasadena, California home in an unnamed future year, as neither of their children had been born when The Big Bang Theory ended in 2019. Bob Newhart appears as Professor Proton in both series; with the appearance in this series, the character is made to look younger. Iain Armitage (Sheldon), Lance Barber (George), and Montana Jordan (Georgie) make a guest appearance in the parent series in a scene in which a VHS tape recorded decades earlier is played.[60] There are other actors who appear in both series but as different characters. This includes Barber, who had another guest appearance in the parent series as a different character, and Kaley Cuoco who stars in the parent series and makes an uncredited voice appearance in this series, voicing an inanimate object.[61][30] Elon Musk made cameo appearances as himself in both series, appearing in the sixth episode of the first season of Young Sheldon.[62][63][64]\n\nThe second-season finale episode aired immediately following the one-hour series finale of the parent series. In a tribute to the parent series finale, several references are made to it in the Young Sheldon episode. The references are both general to the entire parent series, as well as to the series finale in particular. In one scene in the Young Sheldon episode, Sheldon promises his father that when he wins the Nobel Prize, Sheldon will mention him in his acceptance speech. In the parent series finale, Sheldon wins the Nobel Prize, and he does mention his father (among others) in the acceptance speech. In another scene in the Young Sheldon episode, Nobel Prize winners are announced over a montage showing the main characters from the parent series Leonard, Penny, Raj, Howard, Bernadette, and Amy as children. Christine Baranski and Carol Ann Susi, who respectively portray Leonard's mother and Howard's mother in the parent series, make a voice appearance in the montage (a posthumous appearance in the case of Susi). Following the montage, adult Sheldon says that he was wrong about feeling at the moment of the Nobel Prize announcement that he would be all alone for the rest of his life.[65]\n\nTitle sequence\n\nThe show's title sequence is played to Steve Burns' \"Mighty Little Man\", the first track from his 2003 album Songs for Dustmites.[66] The background in the first two seasons shows mountains and a desert, whilst the foreground has Sheldon (usually in bow tie, checked shirt, shorts and cowboy boots) walking out, standing triumphantly, noticing a cow, and backing away from it before resuming his triumphant look as the logo appears and tilts to the sky. Occasionally, a tumbleweed appears, instead of the cow. The title sequence was changed from Season 3 onwards to include the entire Cooper family, as well as showing Sheldon in different costumes, such as Albert Einstein, Mr. Spock, The Flash, an astronaut, and a train engineer.[67] Season 5 features a black bull in place of the cow. In Season 7, the title sequence was slightly changed to include Mandy and Constance (CeeCee). The Cooper family doesn't walk away from the bull. Instead, Georgie shoos the bull away.\n\nRelease\n\nBroadcast\n\nYoung Sheldon began airing weekly episodes on CBS on November 2, 2017, after The Big Bang Theory.

The website's consensus reads, \"Young Sheldon's appealing cast and relatable themes bring a fresh\u2014and overall enjoyable\u2014perspective to its central character's familiar story.\"[93] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 63 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[94]\n\nBen Travers of Indiewire characterized the initial season as \u201csurprising for all the right reasons\u201d.[95] Entertainment Weekly stated that the show has \u201cbrilliant casting\u201d and is overall \u201cinoffensive\u201d and \u201ccomforting\u201d and asserted that compared to The Big Bang Theory, \u201cthe companion series don\u2019t share much DNA\u201d.[96] A USA Today review by Kelly Lawler noted that the \u201cchanges in style and format may be jarring to regular Big Bang viewers\u201d but that this choice \u201cdeserves credit for not forcing the Big Bang model onto a series where it wouldn\u2019t fit\u201d. Lawler assessed Armitage\u2019s depiction of Sheldon Cooper as \u201ccute but not cloying, and just blunt and annoying enough to see hints of Parsons\u2019 version of the character nearly three decades older\u201d.[97] Likewise, a review in the Los Angeles Times stated that the first season \u201chas its own gentler, more naturalistic rhythms and pleasures\u201d compared to its predecessor and that Armitage\u2019s portrayal is \u201ccharming and believable and just suggestive enough of Parsons\u201d.[98] The Colorado Springs Gazette opined that the show is a \"smarter, more humorous and heartfelt show\" than The Big Bang Theory.[99]\n\nThe Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, reviewing only the pilot episode, commended Perry\u2019s performance as \u201ca standout\u201d and described the overall episode as \u201cwarm and embraceable but not yet essential viewing\u201d. Vox gave the show two and a half stars, stating, \u201cIt\u2019s less of a blatant cash grab than it seems\u201d, but disapproved of the humour and set design, asserting \u201cit looks a little cheap, relative to the other, glossier single-camera comedies in its rough weight class\u201d.[100][101] Margaret Lyons of The New York Times argued that the show \u201cisn\u2019t funny\u201d and that \u201cits punch lines\u2026 only come from Sheldon\u2019s inappropriate responses\u201d.[102]\n\nNoel Murray reviewed the final season in The Daily Beast, and described the show as \u201ccharmingly unassuming\u201d and that it \u201cworks in softer, mellower tones\u201d. Murray stated that while \u201cthe comedy often relies on characters hitting the same note over and over\u201d and that \u201cthe show isn\u2019t top-shelf, can\u2019t-miss great\u201d, overall, it is a show that \u201cconnects with a large audience yet still has a meaningful point of view\u201d.[103]\n\nRatings\n\nAccolades\n\nThe fourth season was one of 101 out of the 200 most-popular scripted television series that received the ReFrame Stamp for the years 2020 to 2021. The stamp is awarded by the gender equity coalition ReFrame and industry database IMDbPro for film and television projects that are proven to have gender-balanced hiring, with stamps being awarded to projects that hire female-identifying people, especially women of color, in four out of eight key roles for their production.[122]\n\nMusic\n\nThe first and last shots of the series were set to Dire Straits' \"Walk of Life.\" The show features popular Country, Rock, and Pop songs from the 1980s and early 1990s, and occasionally earlier.\n\nSpin-off series\n\nIn January 2024, it was announced that a spin-off series of Young Sheldon, focusing on Georgie Cooper (portrayed by Montana Jordan) and Mandy McAllister (portrayed by Emily Osment), titled Georgie & Mandy's First Marriage, was in development.[139] On March 5, 2024, CBS announced that the series had been ordered.[140] The series premiered on October 17, 2024.[5]\n\nNotes\n\n^ Both seasons premiered on a Monday, with all the other episodes in the respective seasons broadcasting at the designated time slot. ^ [ 108 ] The eleventh episode of the fourth season aired at 8:30 p.m. due to President Biden's address on the one-year anniversary of the COVID-19 shutdown which aired at 8:00 p.m. on March 11, 2021.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/53/Young_Sheldon_cast_at_KCAs_2024.jpg/250px-Young_Sheldon_cast_at_KCAs_2024.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/68/Young_Sheldon_title_card.png/250px-Young_Sheldon_title_card.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Ambox_current_red.svg/60px-Ambox_current_red.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/40px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/20px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/68/Young_Sheldon_title_card.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/68/Young_Sheldon_title_card.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Sheldon", "title": "Young Sheldon", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/68/Young_Sheldon_title_card.png", "width": 1200, "height": 676}, "title": "Young Sheldon - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
