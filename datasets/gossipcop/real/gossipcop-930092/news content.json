(Zolciak-Biermann had called castmate NeNe Leakes\u2018 home a \u201croach nest\u201d \u2014 a term many of the women told her on Sunday they felt was racist for its cultural implications of impoverished black women living in the projects.)\n\nSpeaking to Cohen, Zolciak-Biermann continued to deny claims that she is racist \u2014 and said racism is only something being magnified by social media.\n\n\u201cThis whole racism thing in this day in age is b\u2014. Everyone of those m\u2014s on that couch owe this world a f\u2014 apology for this racism s\u2014,\u201d Zolciak-Biermann said. \u201cThey already tried to claim that s\u2014 long ago. Nobody bought into it then because the social media wasn\u2019t there and racism wasn\u2019t f\u2014 all that real. You know it.\u201d\n\nIn an Instagram post on Thursday, Zolciak-Biermann backtracked, writing, \u201cDuring the last RHOA Reunion episode, I made a comment that confused and offended people. I sincerely apologize. Edited out of context, I understand why my remark angered people.\u201d\n\n\u201cRacism is a sad reality in the United States,\u201d the reality star continued. \u201cIt has been prevalent throughout our country\u2019s history. Let me be very clear, I do NOT support, tolerate or put up with any form of racism, hate or other discrimination. My love for ALL people runs deep \u2013 I am open to all and always have been.\u201d\n\nThe 39-year-old said she \u201cwas heartbroken\u201d when she watched the reunion episode and \u201csaw how my words were taken out of context.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy comment that seemingly \u2018racism didn\u2019t exist 10 years ago\u2019 was made as part of a larger, emotional 45-minute conversation about how, sadly, social media has become a hub for hate,\u201d she said. \u201cImmediately following my confusing comment, I also said that \u2018it\u2019s not as real as it is now\u2019 referring to the power of social media. But those remarks didn\u2019t make the show.\u201d\n\nZolciak-Biermann reaffirmed her position that social media has amplified racism in the U.S., stating, \u201cBefore social media, the public simply observed the news. Now, the public actively participates and has an opportunity to take action \u2013 in real time.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is a double edged sword. Now, when false accusations are made, they are amplified by online platforms regardless of their merit,\u201d she said. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t the case 10 years ago when I started on RHOA.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

adding, \u201cI will continue to learn from, and be open to, ALL people.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of the initial #RoachGate drama, Leakes called Zolciak-Biermann \u201cracist\u201d and claimed she and her daughter Brielle \u201cdon\u2019t like black people.\u201d Zolciak-Biermann obtained legal counsel against Leakes and said that she received death threats.", "images":
