The Irish-born woman was found dead in a Sherman Oaks, Calif., home on Sept. 28, 2015; the Los Angeles County coroner's office later ruled White took her own life by overdosing on prescription drugs, including Ambien, Propranolol and Percocet (oxycodone and acetaminophen).\n\nThe actor was a pallbearer at her funeral in Ireland.\n\nNeed a news break?

They also alleged that Carrey gave White \u201cthree STDs without warning her.\u201d\n\nCarrey countersued, saying White had tried to extort him after the two broke up in early 2013 and that he made a \"mistake\" of settling a false STD claim with her to avoid mounting a public defense, which \"is a very costly and painful process.\"\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter says that Carrey's attorney had recently asked the court to compel Burton to provide White's STD test results. Through discovery, Boucher came to the conclusion that a 2011 document showing White had clean test results prior to meeting Carrey was a forgery.\n\nOn Thursday, he told USA TODAY the underlying case was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs, removing the possibility of Carrey, 56, going to trial.\n\nMichael Avenatti, the attorney for Sweetman and Burton, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from USA TODAY.\n\nAt the time of White's death, Carrey issued a statement calling her \"a truly kind and delicate Irish flower, too sensitive for this soil, to whom loving and being loved was all that sparkled.\"", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/e5250d36fb1efe316e8b899cc022bec1f5a84fe0/c=0-0-5296-2992/local/-/media/2018/02/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636530933332529383-GTY-873872140-95318359.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/174bf510288d586a78e4964be824c0dc27372658/c=0-0-600-600/local/-/media/2019/03/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636880822400128189-Andrea-Mandel.JPG?width=48&height=48&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gciaf/prod/p?a=pageview&p=USAT-TEALIUM-TANGENT&m=web&k=f14ebdd6-0569-4c64-af73-99937bc06379&s=noscript", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/e5250d36fb1efe316e8b899cc022bec1f5a84fe0/c=0-0-5296-2992/local/-/media/2018/02/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636530933332529383-GTY-873872140-95318359.JPG?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/e5250d36fb1efe316e8b899cc022bec1f5a84fe0/c=0-0-5296-2992/local/-/media/2018/02/01/USATODAY/USATODAY/636530933332529383-GTY-873872140-95318359.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/02/01/lawsuit-against-jim-carrey-ex-girlfriends-family-dismissed/1087667001/", "title": "Lawsuit against Jim Carrey from ex-girlfriend's family dismissed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Lawsuit against Jim Carrey from ex-girlfriend's family dismissed", "description": "Carrey's ex, Cathriona White, committed suicide in 2015.
