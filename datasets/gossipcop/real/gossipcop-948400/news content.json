Pretty fitting.\n\nDrizzy and a crew of about 50 people from OVO hit up E11EVEN in Miami Friday night -- along with Party Next Door and Murda Beatz -- and enjoyed the tracks from his new album from their VIP section.\n\nPlay video content TMZ.com\n\nWe're told Drake's DJ hopped up in the booth to play both the A and B sides from \"Scorpion,\" along with some past Drake tunes ... like \"Yes Indeed\" with Lil Baby.\n\nAs we reported ... the rapper's new album has already made a big splash -- both because it features a song with Michael Jackson, and it admits Drake has a son. It also sparked rumors he's banging Bella Hadid.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/41/16by9/2018/06/29/416cf8f1c31a55a6a4ae2261f55cf073_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/1b/o/2018/06/30/1b7268fda5cb5372830a0a62d42a4f93_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/42/16by9/2018/06/29/42c760aa789c5bd6bf1adb23959e79cb_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/b1/16by9/2025/11/20/b1e4dd899f7f47b18feffa554bcae029_xs.png", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/thirtymilezone.svg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/de/4by3/2025/11/19/def9d7aac6b04006a89c0cf3fb46eb21_xxs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/7b/16by9/2025/11/20/7b11641713234a64a71a01cabd44446a_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/dc/o/2018/06/28/dc14f74924085c659d0609df67119bd4_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/da/16by9/2018/06/30/dab4c2e4f6dd5f2caffd99b3563f6daf_xl.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/article/google-preferred-source.png", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/83/16by9/2018/06/30/831175f1d9f151aeb205373d2f083d5e_md.jpeg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/28/16by9/2025/11/19/281897dd8fc94f789e10d8ee5f6498cb_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/ff/16by9/2025/11/19/fffa59b411c94fc6868ff264a08c1b45_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/f2/16by9/2025/11/20/f2223adcf5b1485c9d1daa3c21389692_xs.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/da/16by9/2018/06/30/dab4c2e4f6dd5f2caffd99b3563f6daf_xl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2018/06/30/drake-scorpion-album-release-party-miami-club/", "title": "Drake Lets Loose at 'Scorpion' Album Release Party in Miami", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=0.25,maximum-scale=10", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "google-site-verification": "UUmtbUBf3djgPpCeLefe_PbFsOc6JGxfXmHzpjFLAEQ", "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "p": {"domain_verify": "933e74ace98032aadbc3328616280038"}, "robots": "index,follow,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Drake partied in the club while cash rained down from the sky at his album release party ... pretty fitting.", "fb": {"app_id": 310610065699820}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tmz"}, "og": {"site_name": "TMZ", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.tmz.com/2018/06/30/drake-scorpion-album-release-party-miami-club/", "title": "Drake Lets Loose at 'Scorpion' Album Release Party in Miami", "description": "Drake partied in the club while cash rained down from the sky at his album release party ... pretty fitting.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/da/16by9/2018/06/30/dab4c2e4f6dd5f2caffd99b3563f6daf_xl.jpg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TMZ", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Drake Lets Loose at 'Scorpion' Album Release Party in Miami", "description": "Drake partied in the club while cash rained down from the sky at his album release party ... pretty fitting.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/da/16by9/2018/06/30/dab4c2e4f6dd5f2caffd99b3563f6daf_xl.jpg"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=299948601, app-argument=https://www.tmz.com/2018/06/30/drake-scorpion-album-release-party-miami-club/?tmz#article", "application-name": "TMZ.COM", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TMZ.COM", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/msapplication-tile-image-270x270-v1.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.tmz.com/?adid=IE9pin", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#000000", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-tooltip": "TMZ | Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Photos;action-uri=https://www.tmz.com/photos/;icon-uri=https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/favicon-32x32-v1.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530331200.0, "source": "https://www.tmz.com", "summary": ""}
