Still, there was definitely a void in the SDCC ecosystem in 2018, with traditional heavy hitters like the Marvel Cinematic Universe and Game of Thrones were AWOL. But that also meant, however, other voices could fill the gap and seize the chance to cut through the usual hype while promoting more forceful messages. The Black Heroes Matter gathering returned to highlight African-American representations in comics; the Eisner Awards saw Marjorie Liu become the first woman ever to win for Best Writer; and panels throughout the event tackled non-commercial topics ranging from Afrofuturism to debunking the idea of \u201cfake geek girls\u201d to how to best battle online trolls.\n\n\u201cWe see a surge in peoples\u2019 ability to recognize their own rights,\u201d said Star Trek: Deep Space Nine star Chase Masterson, who led an independent rally after the convention immigrant rights advocates and groups like the ACLU. \u201cWe see people empowered on a daily basis in the intersection we draw between human rights and pop culture.\u201d\n\nAll that said, Comic Con was still Comic Con.

From that thing? OMG, I think it was!\u201d moments. (No, really, we\u2019re pretty sure that was Navid Negahban who plays the Shadow King on Legion!) So from the socially-minded to the schwifty, we present the 2018 edition of our Top 25 Things We Saw at the San Diego Comic Con.", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/The-young-stars-of-Harry-Potter-593606.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-672108866.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/AP_18204271006798.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/nib-tape-04.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/jack-ryan.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-1002944142.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-1003424128.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/9766884g.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rose-tico-db-tlj_a70bef86.jpeg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/black-mask.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DC-Universe-02.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/DSC_4333.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-1002186206.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/9766841p.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-1003440196.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-1003506478.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/space-gnome-02.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/9766795a.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-1004095264.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-1002911060.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-1001478458.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-1003684324.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-1003509028.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-1001901354.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Jodie-Whittaker-left-and-Ashley-Eckstein-by-Mark-Edwards.jpg?w=300", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/MAD.jpg?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-1003424128.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Arturo Garcia Dave Maass", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-lists/25-best-things-we-saw-at-san-diego-comic-con-2018-702101/", "title": "25 Best Things We Saw at San Diego Comic Con 2018", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The 25 best things we saw at San Diego Comic Con 2018 \u2013 from sneak peeks at 'Aquaman,' 'Halloween' and more to a geek couture fashion show.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Arturo Garcia,Dave Maass", "tags": "Animation, Comic-Con, DC Comics, direct, Marvel, Matt Groening, Spider-Man, Star Trek, Star Wars, SummerContentMB", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "25 Best Things We Saw at San Diego Comic Con 2018", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-lists/25-best-things-we-saw-at-san-diego-comic-con-2018-702101/", "description": "The 25 best things we saw at San Diego Comic Con 2018 \u2013 from sneak peeks at 'Aquaman,' 'Halloween' and more to a geek couture fashion show.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/GettyImages-1003424128.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "width": 1600, "height": 900, "alt": "Cast member Jason Momoa participates on stage during the Warner Bros.
