In February it will also get a plum showcase behind NBC\u2019s Super Bowl telecast.\n\n\u201cOur hope is to create the return of \u2018Must-See TV\u2019 on Thursday,\u201d NBC Entertainment chairman Bob Greenblatt said in a conference call Sunday. The moves on Thursday were designed to \u201cstrategically surround (\u2018This Is Us\u2019) with shows we think are very strong.\u201d\n\nNBC formally unveils its new schedule to advertisers in New York on Monday.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nGreenblatt said NBC considered numerous scenarios for \u201cThis Is Us\u201d in its second season but decided the Thursday move made sense, given NBC\u2019s long legacy on the night that was once home to \u201cCheers,\u201d \u201cFriends,\u201d \u201cSeinfeld,\u201d \u201cHill Street Blues,\u201d \u201cL.A. Law,\u201d \u201cER\u201d and other enduring favorites.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s a little risky there\u2019s a bigger case to be made for redoing Thursday night,\u201d Greenblatt said. And with \u201cThis Is Us\u2019s\u201d undeniable ratings momentum in season one, \u201cif there was one show we could move, it would be this one,\u201d Greenblatt said.\n\nOn Thursday, the post-\u201cThis Is Us\u201d 10 p.m. slot will be filled in the fall by the limited series \u201cLaw & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders.\u201d \u201cThe Blacklist,\u201d which had held down the Thursday 10 p.m. berth this season, moves to Wednesday 9 p.m.\n\nNBC\u2019s post-\u201cVoice\u201d time slot on Monday 10 p.m. went to the new patriotic drama \u201cThe Brave,\u201d about elite military operatives, toplined by Anne Heche. That slot this season went to \u201cTimeless,\u201d the freshman drama that was canceled and un-canceled within 48 hours by NBC last week.\n\nMost of NBC\u2019s other new series orders for the 2017-18 season are being held for midseason debuts. But NBC\u2019s midseason lineup won\u2019t fall in to place until after the Feb. 9-25 run of the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea.\n\nGreenblatt emphasized that NBC was focused on further lowering the volume of in-season repeats and \u201cspreading the wealth\u201d of scripted programming into the summer. The Winter Olympics, the five \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d games in the fall and the Super Bowl are pillars for the strategy.\n\n\u201cWe took all of the advantages we have and tried to use them to grow and expand the lineup in as many ways as we could,\u201d Greenblatt said.\n\nThe comedy block of \u201cSuperstore\u201d and \u201cThe Good Place\u201d that had aired Thursday 8-9 p.m. this season will relocate to Tuesday 9-10 p.m., sandwiched between \u201cThe Voice\u201d and \u201cChicago Fire.\u201d The hope is the stronger lead-in will be a boost for the pair, which had a hard job of opening Thursday against ABC\u2019s \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d and CBS\u2019 \u201cThe Big Bang Theory\u201d this season.\n\nAfter \u201cWill & Grace\u201d ends its 12-episode run, Greenblatt indicated that NBC would refresh the Thursday 8-9 p.m. slot with \u201cSuperstore\u201d and another comedy pairing, which would in turn open up the Tuesday post-\u201cVoice\u201d slot for new series. \u201cThere\u2019s a little juggling going on,\u201d he said.\n\nOn Sunday nights after regular season football ends, the schedule will include the return of Steve Harvey\u2019s \u201cLittle Big Shots,\u201d a new unscripted offering from Ellen DeGeneres, \u201cEllen\u2019s Game of Games,\u201d and the third season of the Jennifer Lopez starrer \u201cShades of Blue.\u201d\n\nNBC FALL 2017-18 SCHEDULE\n\n(New programs in UPPER CASE; all times ET)\n\nMONDAY\n\n8-10 P.M. \u2014 The Voice\n\n10-11 P.M. \u2014 THE BRAVE\n\nTUESDAY\n\n8-9 P.M. \u2014 The Voice\n\n9-9:30 P.M. \u2014 Superstore\n\n9:30-10 P.M. \u2014 The Good Place\n\n10-11 P.M. \u2014 Chicago Fire\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\n8-9 P.M. \u2014 The Blacklist\n\n9-10 P.M. \u2014 Law & Order: SVU\n\n10-11 P.M. \u2014 Chicago P.D.\n\nTHURSDAY\n\n8-8:30 P.M. \u2014 WILL & GRACE\n\n8:30-9 P.M. \u2014 Great News\n\n9-10 P.M. \u2014 This Is Us\n\n10-11 P.M. \u2014 LAW & ORDER TRUE CRIME: THE MENENDEZ MURDERS\n\nFRIDAY\n\n8-9 P.M. \u2014 Blindspot\n\n9-10 P.M. \u2014 Taken\n\n10-11 P.M \u2014 Dateline NBC\n\nSATURDAY\n\n8-10 P.M. \u2014Dateline Saturday Night Mystery\n\n10-11 P.M. \u2014 Saturday Night Live (encores)\n\nSUNDAY\n\n7-8:20 P.M. \u2014 Football Night in America\n\n8:20-11 P.M. \u2014 NBC Sunday Night Football\n\nNEW SERIES ORDERS\n\nDRAMA\n\n\u201cTHE BRAVE\u201d\n\nFrom Keshet Studios and Avi Nir (executive producer of \u201cHomeland\u201d) comes a fresh, heart-pounding journey into the complex world of America\u2019s elite undercover military heroes.
