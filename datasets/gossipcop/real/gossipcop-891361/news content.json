In came star Chris Hemsworth, sporting a dollar store Thor costume and long, blonde wig and hammer. Next, Tom Hiddleston, similarly decked out in knock-off apparel and a bad wig, walked on stage to raucous applause. That wasn\u2019t all, however, as Cate Blanchett, who stars as Hela, Goddess of Death in the film, showed up with an array of pipe cleaners on her back, fashioned to imitate the horns of her character.\n\n\u201cI think those poor people just want to watch the movie,\u201d Blanchett said in a taped interview backstage.\n\nThe opening scene done, Jeff Goldblum, who plays the Grandmaster in the film, made an entrance on a scooter to introduce his \u201cgrand champion,\u201d Mark Ruffalo, who, of course, was dressed in a cheap Hulk costume with green, rubber fists.\n\nHemsworth and Ruffalo battled their way through the crowded theater that preluded a \u201cbrief, 45-minute intermission,\u201d as announced by Corden.\n\nWhen the show returned, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Hiddleston and Tessa Thompson squared off against Blanchett and her \u201cferocious guard dog\u201d \u2014 a stuffed huskie dog. \u201cAnd they all lived happily ever after\u2026until the next Thor movie,\u201d Corden narrated.\n\nBackstage, the actors celebrated. \u201cThor: Ragnarok 4D gets 10 Goldblums out of a possible 10 Goldblums. That\u2019s my highest rating,\u201d Goldblum said.\n\nWatch the video below.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thor-_ragnarok_4d_with_the_thor_cast.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thor-_ragnarok_4d_with_the_thor_cast.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patrick Shanley", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/thor-ragnarok-cast-act-live-performance-surprised-theater-1054678/", "title": "\u2018Thor: Ragnarok\u2019 Cast Acts Out Live Performance for Surprised Theater", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum and Tessa Thompson treated an unexpected audience to a 4D experience on the 'Late Late Show With James Corden.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Patrick Shanley", "tags": "Cate Blanchett, Chris Hemsworth, James Corden, Jeff Goldblum, The Late Late Show, Thor: Ragnarok, Tom Hiddleston", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Thor: Ragnarok\u2019 Cast Acts Out Live Performance for Surprised Theater", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/thor-ragnarok-cast-act-live-performance-surprised-theater-1054678/", "description": "Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum and Tessa Thompson treated an unexpected audience to a 4D experience on the 'Late Late Show With James Corden.'", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thor-_ragnarok_4d_with_the_thor_cast.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "'Thor: Ragnarok' Cast Acts Out Live Performance Surprised Theater"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-03T09:31:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-03T10:38:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Mark Ruffalo, Cate Blanchett, Jeff Goldblum and Tessa Thompson treated an unexpected audience to a 4D experience on the 'Late Late Show With James Corden.'", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Thor: Ragnarok\u2019 Cast Acts Out Live Performance for Surprised Theater", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/thor-_ragnarok_4d_with_the_thor_cast.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/8atgsWFfDOg"], "publish_date": 1509701478.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
