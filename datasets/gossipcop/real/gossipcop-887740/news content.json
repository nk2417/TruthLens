There was a whole thing.\"\n\nLetterman then took a walk down memory lane and recalled the time he gifted Conan O'Brien with a horse, which didn't go over too well.\n\nThe intention behind the present was that O'Brien would bring the horse out on his show and it would \"take a dump\" on the stage, an idea that Letterman found \"hilarious.\"\n\nHowever, the former host said a few days later, he learned something went \"terribly wrong.\"\n\n\"I get this warm, lovely letter that says, 'My wife loves the horse, and she's going to keep the horse because she an equestrian'\" Letterman reminisced. \"Now I'm screwed because I was counting on him returning the horse and I get my money back.\"\n\nFurther defending the gift, he exclaimed, \"It was joke! Take a dump on the stage, load him up, get him back!\"\n\nO'Brien has apparently changed his mind about the horse since his \"warm letter.\"\n\n\"From what people are talking about, Conan will just not shut up about the horse. The horse has gone crazy, maybe its from being around Conan all day,\" Letterman quipped. \"Of course he's unridable, all he had to do was take a dump on the stage.\"\n\nFor 33 years, Letterman fans got to watch jokes such as these when he was a late-night television host, first getting his start on NBC's Late Night before going on to host The Late Show.\n\nOn May 20, 2015, over 13 million people watched Letterman host his final episode of The Late Show. Here's a look at some of the highlights from the memorable evening:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-03/et_davidletterman_030617_1280.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-08/letterman_1280_665983280.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2015-05/640_drew_barrymore_david_letterman.jpg?width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/david_letterman_jkl.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/david_letterman_jkl.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/david-letterman-returns-late-night-jimmy-kimmel-live-reveals-what-he-misses-most-about-hosting", "title": "David Letterman Returns to Late Night on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live,' Reveals What He Misses Most About Hosting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/david_letterman_jkl.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "\"It's so good to see famous people again!\"", "title": "David Letterman Returns to Late Night on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live,' Reveals What He Misses Most About Hosting", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/david-letterman-returns-late-night-jimmy-kimmel-live-reveals-what-he-misses-most-about-hosting", "type": "Article"}, "description": "\"It's so good to see famous people again!\"", "twitter": {"description": "\"It's so good to see famous people again!\"", "title": "David Letterman Returns to Late Night on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live,' Reveals What He Misses Most About Hosting", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/david-letterman-returns-late-night-jimmy-kimmel-live-reveals-what-he-misses-most-about-hosting", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/david_letterman_jkl.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "David Letterman Returns to Late Night on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live,' Reveals What He Misses Most About Hosting | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, David Letterman, Jimmy Kimmel Live", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
