Verne was a fantastic human being.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day you see him, you go, \u2018Wow that is a small human,'\u201d he said. \u201cBut by the end of the day, you just saw Verne. It just sort of went away. He was part of the cast and fantastic. I miss him.\u201d\n\nMyers said he worked with Troyer for a long time, adding that he was \u201ca great comedian.\u201d\n\nMyers and Troyer shared the screen in all three \u201cAustin Powers\u201d films, with Troyer starring as the iconic Mini-Me. They also appeared together in the 2008 comedy \u201cThe Love Guru.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cAs written, Mini-Me is almost a prop. But he brought it up off the page, better than written,\u201d Myers said. \u201cWe just ended up giving him more and more stuff to do.\u201d\n\nMyers recalled that Troyer was loved by so many that wherever \u201cThe Gong Show\u201d host traveled, fans referenced the Mini-Me character.\n\n\u201cI went to the White House \u2014 President Obama\u2019s White House \u2014 because it was a state dinner for Justin Trudeau of Canada,\u201d Myers remembered. \u201cI went up and met President Obama and he said, \u2018Mike, so glad to see you. How\u2019s Mini-Me?\u2019 Then I met Trudeau and he said, \u2018Hey buddy, how\u2019s it going? How\u2019s Mini-Me?'\u201d\n\nMyers also mentioned that Troyer would travel to different countries for charity work. The Facebook post that announced his death asked for donations to his favorite charities in Troyer\u2019s name in lieu of sending flowers.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://source.unsplash.com/random/595x333", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/verne-troyer-mike-myers.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/verne-troyer-mike-myers.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ariana Brockington", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/mike-myers-verne-troyer-tribute-1202797647/", "title": "Mike Myers Remembers \u2018Austin Powers\u2019 Co-Star Verne Troyer: \u2018I Miss Him\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "During his appearance on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!,\u2019 Mike Myers recalled working with \u201cAustin Powers\u201d co-star Verne Troyer who died on April 21.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Ariana Brockington", "tags": "Jimmy Kimmel Live, Mike Myers, Verne Troyer", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Mike Myers Remembers \u2018Austin Powers\u2019 Co-Star Verne Troyer: \u2018I Miss Him\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/mike-myers-verne-troyer-tribute-1202797647/", "description": "During his appearance on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!,\u2019 Mike Myers recalled working with \u201cAustin Powers\u201d co-star Verne Troyer who died on April 21.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/verne-troyer-mike-myers.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Verne Troyer Mike Myers"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-03T20:35:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-03T20:35:31+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "During his appearance on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!,\u2019 Mike Myers recalled working with \u201cAustin Powers\u201d co-star Verne Troyer who died on April 21.", "site": "@variety", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mike Myers Remembers \u2018Austin Powers\u2019 Co-Star Verne Troyer: \u2018I Miss Him\u2019", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/verne-troyer-mike-myers.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525379731.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
