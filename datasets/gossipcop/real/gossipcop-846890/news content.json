Soules called 911 and checked the victim\u2019s pulse, but the tractor driver, Kenneth Mosher, later died as a result of his injuries. Hours later, Soules was arrested at his home in Arlington, Iowa.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Mugshots See which stars have been behind bars, ranging from Justin Bieber to Reese Witherspoon\n\nAccording to TMZ, the search warrant allows police to obtain Soules\u2019 blood test results from the hospital. However, the results may not be accurate, because when police arrived to arrest Soules, there was a delay while they obtained a search warrant to enter his home. \u201cChris did stay in his home and would not come out until the police provided a search warrant to enter his home,\u201d the law enforcement source tells Us. (The Buchanan County Sheriff\u2019s Office has no comment.)\n\nRelated: Stars at Court Chris Brown isn't the only celeb who has faced a judge.

TMZ says police may be interested in the results to determine if alcohol or drugs were a factor in the accident. The site reported that Soules allegedly had alcoholic beverage containers in his possession at the time of the crash, but he was not charged with driving under the influence.\n\nTMZ also reports that police have obtained a search warrant for the red Chevy that picked up Soules from the scene of the accident. Per the Associated Press, a judge sealed the warrants that let police obtain the blood samples and to enter Soules\u2019 home.\n\nRelated: The Bachelor After the Final Rose: Broken Engagements and More!

The ankle monitor was a precaution because Soules previously \u201chad plans to leave the country\u201d before his arrest.\n\nSoules has retained Des Moines attorneys Alfredo Parrish, Brandon Brown and Gina Messamer. In a statement to Us Weekly, the legal team says, \u201cSoules\u2019 911 call, released yesterday, proved that the initial knee-jerk coverage of this accident was incorrect. While initial reports suggested Soules fled the scene, the 911 call confirms that Soules in fact was the one who contacted law enforcement immediately. During the call, he clearly identified himself and explained his role in the terrible accident. Soules attempted to resuscitate Mr. Mosher and remained on the scene with him until emergency medical personnel arrived.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued: \u201cHis attorneys are confident that once all the evidence is made public, it will show Soules acted reasonably and did everything in his power to provide aid to Mr. Mosher. Due to the nature of the pending charges, neither Soules nor his counsel will be making any statements at this time. Soules and his family request that their privacy and the privacy of Mr. Mosher\u2019s family is respected.\u201d", "images":
