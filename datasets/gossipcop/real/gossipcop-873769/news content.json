Considering how many enemies Miller has racked up over the years.\n\nChloe Lukasiak, who left Dance Moms in 2014 amidst an ongoing feud with her the notorious dance instructor, has announced that she\u2019ll return to the Lifetime series for Season 8.\n\nBy sheer coincidence (or the opposite of that, really), Miller will NOT be a part of Season 8.\n\nShe angrily announced her resignation from the program in March, and was then sentenced to over a year in prison a couple months later for her role in deceiving the government about her finances.\n\nDuring her run on the show, Miller often bullied Lukasiak to the point of tears.\n\nWe were happy when Chloe chose to leave and now we\u2019re happy that she\u2019s rubbing her return in Miller\u2019s face.\n\nMore or less, at least.\n\n\"It was pretty insane and out of nowhere,\" Lukasiak tells Seventeen of why she\u2019s chosen to make her comeback, emphasizing that she hasn\u2019t seen Abby in a long time and gushing over her replacement.\n\n\"We have Cheryl Burke. She is so amazing. She\u2019s been in the industry a long time. She was on Dancing with the Stars.\n\n\"She really got us and took us under her wing.\"\n\nHow would Chloe compare Burke to Miller? Are the two equally competitive?\n\n\"She\u2019s pretty competitive, but she really cares about us,\" Chloe said, throwing some quality subtle shade in Miller\u2019s direction.\n\nHow does it feel to be back on a team?\n\n\"I was thrilled to be dancing with my friends again,\" Chloe told the publication, adding:\n\n\"I competed for a year without them, but it wasn\u2019t the same. And there are some new faces on the show this season.\"\n\nLifetime released an extended trailer for Season 8 (below) earlier this week, making it clear that Miller\u2019s presence will still be felt on the series and that some major drama is on tap.\n\n\"You can expect\u2026 lots of crying,\" Lukasiak teases of what\u2019s to come, expounding as follows:\n\n\"I cried so much. I was like, \u2018I\u2019m such a crybaby.\u2019 And all of the dances I\u2019ve done on the most recent season I\u2019ve really loved. The last number of the season is amazing.\n\n\"But you have to keep an open mind this season because it does change a lot and it\u2019s going to be a little different than what fans are used to.\n\n\"I think the change was good for all of us.\"\n\nWhile you wait to watch Dance Moms online and/or on television after it returns in August, Lukasiak would also like to remind you that she has a book coming out.\n\nIt\u2019s titled \u201cGirl on Pointe: Chloe\u2019s Guide to Talking on the World\u201d and it will be released on January 23, 2018.\n\nChloe will delve into her history on Dance Moms in the memoir, which she previews in this way:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of an inspiration and advice book, so I think it\u2019s for anyone who needs help, or wants to know they\u2019re not alone in these teen years.\n\n\"I give advice about how to get through a bad day or a bad week, and how I deal with that.\u201d\n\nWe look forward to reading it.\n\nAnd we look forward to your Dance Moms return, Chloe.", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/2552_D085_00216R-H-2025-80x80.webp", "http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chloe-lukasiak-picture-775x1024.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1154615733-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2159895990-6-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/kendall-jenner-khloe-kardashian-and-kylie-jenner-gq-and-giorgio-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247300883-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/leah-block-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/12/1206_annaduggar_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1119_janellebrown_angelamoody_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/69023040a27d084abe99b818-80x80.webp", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1119_tekashi6ix9ine_header-80x80.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chloe-lukasiak-picture-775x1024.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kay Rhodes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/06/chloe-lukasiak-rubs-dance-moms-return-in-abby-lee-millers-face/", "title": "Chloe Lukasiak Rubs Dance Moms Return in Abby Lee Miller's Face", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chloe Lukasiak Rubs Dance Moms Return in Abby Lee Miller\u2019s Face", "description": "Abby Lee Miller is on her way out.
