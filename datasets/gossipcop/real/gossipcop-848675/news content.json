They dare to do the impossible, encouraging young visionaries to break\u2014not just push\u2014boundaries, inspiring people around the world to fight for what they believe in. Here, black-ish star Yara Shahidi joins our 2017 Women Who Dare series.\n\nYara Shahidi can hold her own in any conversation. When it comes to topics of fashion and beauty, the 17-year-old\u2019s eyes light up (she\u2019s a fan); and she\u2019s just as comfortable chatting about superhero movies (she\u2019s dying to play X-Men\u2019s Storm, Nightcrawler, or Ms. Marvel) as she is popular music (her father was Prince\u2019s photographer for years and her cousin is the rapper Nas, so she\u2019s practically encyclopedic on the subject). But what sets Shahidi apart from many young women her age is not only her ability to engage in more serious discussions surrounding race, gender, and identity issues, but the fact that she's actually leading those conversations.\n\nShahidi is more than an actress\u2014she\u2019s an activist. The college-bound star of black-ish, and the new spin-off series grown-ish, is fearless when it comes to using her voice to effect change and shed light on social injustices. \u201cTo be in this industry, as fabulous as it is, it can seem very trivial if there is no grounding meaning behind why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing,\u201d says Shahidi, who will head to Harvard sometime next year when she has a break from filming. \u201cWhen you\u2019re driven by a certain purpose, for me, it\u2019s helping better anyone\u2019s life. Whether it\u2019s via Twitter or whether it\u2019s choosing my sociology major. I know ultimately I want to help effect change, otherwise I would look at myself in the mirror everyday and think, \u2018what in the world am I doing with my life?\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile most celebrities\u2014regardless of age\u2014tip-toe around divisive topics like intersectional feminism, Shahidi boldly addresses them head-on. It\u2019s her passion for knowledge and hunger for education that hasn\u2019t just landed the actress two hit television shows, but also a letter of recommendation from former First Lady Michelle Obama, and her upcoming spot at Harvard University. \u201cI am just a history nerd. That has motivated a whole lot, for me to just understand my society. I have always loved school, but what made it fascinating was finding the ways I was connected to the world around me,\u201d she explains. \u201cI am constantly listening to podcasts, but I do not know everything that there is to know. But I would like to try to. The more you learn about someone, how could you not want to protect them and their rights? The more you learn about a culture or a certain identity, it\u2019s hard to not feel empathy.\u201d\n\nOn Instagram, Shahidi curates a mix of behind-the-scenes video footage from her on-set antics; favorite red carpet fashion and makeup moments; and call-to-action posts for her 1.3 million followers. In the current political climate, how does Shahidi see the role of fashion and beauty? \u201cWith everything going on, [fashion and beauty] has actually become more important in my life,\u201d she admits. \u201cI was just going through my closet, and I have so many political T-shirts. It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s all I own right now,\u201d she laughs, listing some of her favorites, like the shirts with senators\u2019 numbers on them, or the shirts about funding Planned Parenthood. Shahidi is of the belief that fashion, makeup, and hair are more than just a visual statement. \u201cIt\u2019s really important and there\u2019s a huge conversation around everyone having a safe space. Fashion is one of those places in which when you\u2019re wearing something that feels like a representation of you, it does create, in a matter of speaking, a space for you to exist. Even if it\u2019s just in a two-inch radius of where you are. It\u2019s a walking personalized area in which you can live.\u201d\n\nIt can be easy to forget that Shahidi is only 17, given her bubbly confidence, fierce work ethic, and intrinsic wisdom. It\u2019s why she\u2019s keenly aware of making sure she at least looks her age whenever possible, with the help of her go-to makeup artist Emily Cheng. When she\u2019s not on-set as Zoey Johnson, Shahidi is often in jeans and an aforementioned political T-shirt, usually with natural makeup and hair. \u201cMy everyday routine is primarily skincare,\u201d says the actress, who works with Clean & Clear. \u201cI start the day with a cleanser, then I use rose hip oil on my face, then I usually raid my cabinet of goodies that Emily has given me: eye patches or a full face mask. I usually go downstairs and freak my brother\u2019s out with a face mask.\u201d Shahidi is also a huge fan of Glossier, noting that the only makeup she\u2019ll use on a day off is the Boy Brow gel and Balm Dot Com lip balm.\n\nEven on the red carpet, Shahidi and Cheng strive to create fun, fresh looks that strike a balance between wearing couture and being college-bound. That typically translates to a nude lip (Shahidi says Cheng has developed a mix of four colors to create \u201cthe perfect nude lipstick for my shade of brown\u201d) and a colorful flick of eyeliner or shadow. For this story, we pushed Shahidi out of her comfort zone with the challenge of wearing some of the season\u2019s boldest takes on classic makeup looks. Game to try\u2014and learn\u2014about anything and everything, Shahidi\u2019s excitement at wearing layers of glitter, yellow eyeliner, and a metallic-and-glossy red lip was contagious. \u201cI am not scared to try much,\u201d she says.\n\nThe New Glitter\n\nGlitter will always be in style. But the new way to wear it involves not just tiny flecks of shimmer strewn across the face, but layer-upon-layer of glittery embellishment. After prepping your lids, use lash or cosmetic glitter glue to stick the first layer of silver flecks and then the silver confetti. Then, using a Tweezer, carefully apply Swarovski crystals (or simple rhinestones) across your eyelid like eyeliner.\n\nGlitters in Silver 2 Make Up For Ever, $15, sephora.com .

That's because she's a lipgloss aficionado. \"I have every single Chanel color. I am not very possessive over much...take my bed! Take my house! Whatever. But I am oddly possessive over this large box [of gloss]. This is the first time I have felt a twinge of possessiveness.\" To get this liquid metallic, deep-red lip look, Cheng first applied a red metallic pigment on Shahidi's lips, then layered two different Rouge Coco Gloss shades to create the ultimate red lipstick upgrade.\n\nRouge Coco Gloss Moisturizing Glossimer in 772 Chanel, $30, nordstrom.com .

Use individual segments or cut-up a strip of lashes and place them across just your bottom lashline. These aren't even trying to pass for natural\u2014and that's precisely the point. On darker skin, a swipe of metallic silver eyeshadow underneath your lower lashes will help the effect really pop.\n\nDido Double Hoop Swarovski Crystal Earrings Dannijo, $289, farfetch.com .

Ever since her Fenty Beauty Trophy Wife highlighter dropped, we don't want to use any other metallic makeup but classic yellow-gold. Don't be afraid to sweep Trophy Wife (or any other metallic gold pigment) all over your face. Trace it across your eyelids, cheekbones, Cupid's bow, and lips. Sweep it down your neck and across your collarbone and shoulders. Then pop-on a pair of classic gold hoops to amplify the all-golden vibes.\n\nOmbre Premi\u00e9re Longwear Powder Eyeshadow in Poudre D'Or Chanel, $30, nordstrom.com\n\n.

The rounded flick lends a bit of edge to an otherwise classic makeup look. Cheng used two formulas to nail this liner: a liquid formula to first draw the shape, then a cream to reach the most intense black pigment.\n\nCalligraphie de Chanel Longwear Intense Cream Eyeliner Chanel, $35, nordstrom.com\n\n.

I am really excited about this yellow eye, because yellow is currently my favorite color,\" she says. On set for this shoot, the actress played music from her \"yellow\" playlist\u2014or songs that fit the vibe of the color yellow.\n\nDuo Eyeshadow in Fashion Rebel Nars Cosmetics, $36, narscosmetics.com .

That's because the way you'll want to wear blush in 2018 is the same way people wore it in 1982: swept high across the cheekbones for major impact. To keep the look from veering too costume-y, keep your skin fresh and dewy (so no powder!) and use a blush in a blend-able cream formula. Tap it on lightly, at first, with your finger, warming it into your skin slowly and working from your cheekbones, toward your temples, and across your outer eyelids.\n\nSmall Impatiens Flower Drop
