As is typical with all things AHS, Lourd's role is not being revealed at this point. But we do know next season will be set in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, with the premiere taking place on Election Night. (And hey, she would make a pretty good Ivanka Trump, wouldn't she?)\n\nLourd has played the earmuff-clad Chanel #3 on Murphy's Fox horror-comedy Scream Queens for the past two seasons; that role was actually her on-screen debut. After two low-rated seasons, though, Queens looks headed for cancellation. (A Season 3 renewal is currently \"a long-shot,\" according to TVLine's Renewal Scorecard.) Lourd also has a role as Lieutenant Connix in the current Star Wars sequels; her mother was the late Carrie Fisher.\n\nAHS veterans Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters have already signed on to join the cast of Season 7, slated to debut this fall \u2014 along with series newcomer Billy Eichner.", "images": ["https://www.tvline.com/img/TVLine-Icon-RGB-Default-Color.svg", "https://www.tvline.com/img/TVLine-Logo-RGB-Default-Color.svg", "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/casting-news/american-horror-story-cast-billie-lourd-season-7-election-816101/billie-lourd-cast-american-horror-story-season-7.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/casting-news/american-horror-story-cast-billie-lourd-season-7-election-816101/billie-lourd-cast-american-horror-story-season-7.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Nemetz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.tvline.com/casting-news/american-horror-story-cast-billie-lourd-season-7-election-816101/", "title": "'American Horror Story': Billie Lourd To Star In Season 7 On FX", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "thumbnail": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/casting-news/american-horror-story-cast-billie-lourd-season-7-election-816101/billie-lourd-cast-american-horror-story-season-7.jpg", "description": "\"Scream Queens\" star Billie Lourd has nabbed a leading role in the election-themed Season 7 of FX's \"American Horror Story.\"", "mrf": {"tags": "Content Type:Legacy Article;Primary Category:Casting News;Category:Casting News;Headline Approver:Unknown;Trello Board:Legacy"}, "og": {"site_name": "TVLine", "title": "American Horror Story: Billie Lourd To Star In Election-Themed Season 7 - TVLine", "image": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/casting-news/american-horror-story-cast-billie-lourd-season-7-election-816101/billie-lourd-cast-american-horror-story-season-7.jpg", "description": "\"Scream Queens\" star Billie Lourd has nabbed a leading role in the election-themed Season 7 of FX's \"American Horror Story.\"", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.tvline.com/casting-news/american-horror-story-cast-billie-lourd-season-7-election-816101/"}, "twitter": {"title": "American Horror Story: Billie Lourd To Star In Election-Themed Season 7 - TVLine", "description": "\"Scream Queens\" star Billie Lourd has nabbed a leading role in the election-themed Season 7 of FX's \"American Horror Story.\"", "site": "@TVLine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/casting-news/american-horror-story-cast-billie-lourd-season-7-election-816101/billie-lourd-cast-american-horror-story-season-7.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-04-06T23:06:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2024-04-25T20:40:32+00:00", "author": "Dave Nemetz"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491451200.0, "source": "https://tvline.com", "summary": ""}
