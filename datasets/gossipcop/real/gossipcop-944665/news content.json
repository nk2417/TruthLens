{"url": "https://people.com/tv/bachelor-raven-gates-bekah-martinez-twitter-feud/", "text": "It appears that Raven Gates and Bekah Martinez are no longer friends.\n\nLeaving their days of receiving red roses on ABC behind, The Bachelor alums were the ones dishing out jabs and clapbacks at each other on Friday as they engaged in a fiery Twitter feud.\n\nIt all started after Martinez, 23, watched the June 4 episode of The Bachelorette in which Becca Kufrin confronted Colton Underwood about his relationship with her close friend and former Bachelor contestant, Tia Booth.\n\nThough both Underwood and Booth have said that things between them didn\u2019t work out, Martinez tweeted otherwise when she shared a photo of Booth sitting in Underwood\u2019s lap, which was previously posted by RealitySteve.\n\n\u201cTia+Colton: \u2018yeah Becca, we\u2019re both 100% over each other! we\u2019re TOTALLY not planning on getting back together/probably engaged the minute we\u2019re in paradise (we\u2019re gonna get so many followers from this manufactured narrative lol),\u201d Martinez wrote.\n\nBob D'Amico via Getty; RB/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images\n\nGates quickly reacted to Martinez\u2019s tweet to defend close friend Booth.\n\n\u201cMake sure you follow @whats_ur_sign_ so she can get those followers so she can stop talking s\u2013t about her friends.. like tia!! And Becca!! Come on now hurry up!!\u201d Gates said in a since-deleted tweet. (But don\u2019t worry, Bachelor Nation had the receipts to prove it!)\n\nTo which Martinez replied, \u201cGirl I would never talk s\u2013t on Becca because she\u2019s as real as it gets. That\u2019s the reason I tweeted that thing about Colton and Tia in the first place, because it looked like they both played her on this one.\u201d\n\nHowever, it didn\u2019t end there as Gates said, \u201cYou know that Tia didn\u2019t. And you\u2019re entitled to your opinion. I don\u2019t like the situation either, but if you said you\u2019d stop bashing Tia, then you should keep your word.\u201d\n\nThe feud showed no signs of slowing down, with Gates cryptically tweeting about the social media showdown without mentioning Martinez\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cHow can people be so full of hate all of the time? Aren\u2019t you tired??\u201d she wrote before taking down the tweet.\n\n\u201cHow can you hate on your \u2018friends\u2019 constantly?? Why\u2019d you delete your first tweet that was directly aimed at me? Why don\u2019t you just @ me?\u201d\n\nThe back-and-forth ultimately resulted in Gates deleting a majority of her tweets and blocking Martinez on Twitter.\n\n\u201cJust so you guys know, Bekah tweeted something rude & unnecessary to create drama & I went to stick up for my friend who can\u2019t respond right now. I decided to delete the tweets & I blocked her bc I don\u2019t want to keep engaging with someone who will continuously drag her \u2018friends,\u2019 \u201d Gates later clarified, after condemning Martinez for being \u201cso cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so sad that people find their self worth from being mean and hateful to their friends,\u201d Gates tweeted about Martinez.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Martinez to respond as she tweeted, \u201c1. keep acting like Tia and I were besties since that\u2019s the best you can do here. 2. there are not enough twitter characters to address the rest of your self-contradicting bulls\u2013t.\u201d\n\nWhile Underwood and Booth have spoken out about their brief fling in January, Kufrin did not take the news of them dating well, especially considering the fact that she and Tia are actually good friends.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I feel about it,\u201d she said during the June 4 episode. \u201cIt makes me feel a little bit sick. I\u2019m very attracted to you, I really like where our conversation was on night one and I feel like we had a lot in common, but it\u2019s a very tricky situation. It puts me in a very strange position. It\u2019s just a lot to take in right now.\u201d\n\nPaul Hebert/ABC; Noel Vasquez/Getty Images\n\nAt the beginning of the year, Underwood and Booth met up in Los Angeles for a date, and a few weeks later, he learned that he had been selected to be a contestant on Kufrin\u2019s season.\n\nBooth exclusively told PEOPLE that she tried to tell Kufrin about the relationship at the live After the Final Rose taping in March, but was not able to do so.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to make sure they would give each other a chance,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want Becca to see our friendship as the most important thing and not give him that chance.\u201d\n\nThe Bachelorette airs Mondays (8 p.m. ET) on ABC.", "images":
