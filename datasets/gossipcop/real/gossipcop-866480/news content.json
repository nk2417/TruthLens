We caught up with Victoria backstage and she was totally eager to spill all of her fashion and beauty secrets! Read on for her back-to-school style tips, beauty must-haves and the inside scoop on her Teen Choice Awards red-carpet look!\n\nSeventeen: How would you describe your personal style in only three words?\n\nVictoria Justice: Comfortable, laid-back and colorful.\n\n17: What about your beauty style? What are some beauty products that you just can't live without?\n\nVJ: I love blush. I don't have to wear any other makeup as long as I have blush. And Great Lash mascara. I just used it today for the first time and it's amazing! It separates your lashes and makes them look so long. It's really, really cheap, too!\n\n17: Awesome! And is your real-life style anything like your character's on Victorious?\n\nVJ:\n\nTotally! I always go into the wardrobe room and pick out things that I like. My own personal style has sort of influenced my character's style. And at the end of the first season, I got to keep a lot of [Tori's] clothes. My favorite was this one white shirt with lace sleeves that billow out. I thought it was really pretty.\n\n17: Sounds cute! How about on the red carpet? Have you had a favorite red-carpet look?\n\nVJ: Just recently, I wore a dress to the Teen Choice Awards by Mason. It was a really deep blue. The neckline was really pretty, just the way that it was cut up top. And I wore leopard print YSL pumps with it. The shoes were amazing. I was in love with them.\n\n17: It was a gorgeous look! What would you say has been the best bargain that you've found while out shopping?\n\nVJ: I do a lot of vintage shopping. I love going to second-hand stores. Buffalo Exchange is one of my favorites. I found this one shirt by Chanel in there for $10. I was like, \"That's amazing.\" I love that shirt! I actually brought it with me on this trip.\n\n17: Since it's almost back-to-school time, we have to ask: do you remember ever wearing a really terrible BTS outfit?\n\nVJ: Well, I only went to school up until the beginning of tenth grade and I think that's when my style was developing. I don't think I ever wore anything that was like really ugly, I just didn't really care. Oh, wait! [I wore] bell-bottom jeans! Now, when I look back at pictures, I'm like, \"Oh God. I look like I'm in the '70s or something!\" It was awful. I hope my style has improved since then.\n\nJudging by the rock-star black skinny jeans and her totally perfect-for-fall cropped plaid jacket, Victoria's style today definitely makes the grade! Do you watch Victorious and love Victoria as much as we do? Sound off in comments!", "images": ["https://www.seventeen.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon",
