It feels like I\u2019m back to dancing \u2014 the training, the intensity. You need to be aware of your movement up in the wires and how your body works,\u201d she says.\n\nBut Vikander took the preparation seriously, knowing that she had big shoes to fill after Angelina Jolie\u2018s iconic performance in the original film.\n\n\u201c[Angelina] set a whole tone for that kind of role, so I knew we had to do something very different.\u201d", "images":
