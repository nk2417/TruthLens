In her second work for Converse, Millie Bobby Brown (aka, Eleven from Stranger Things) tries to capture all those feels in 32 fun reaction GIFs as part of a new digital campaign from Big Spaceship.\n\nBrown, who is 13, is one of the coolest teens around right now, and perfect for this kind of campy project. The GIFs will run on media outlets like BuzzFeed and Teen Vogue in North America, U.K. and France, and on Converse\u2019s website and social channels.\n\nThis supercut video shows lots of the footage from which the GIFs were made:\n\nBelow are the GIFs themselves. The campaign promotes Converse\u2019s new back-to-school collection, including apparel, shoes and backpacks.\n\nBrown previously promoted Converse in this ad from Anomaly, in which she highlighted lots of classic film characters who wore the brand\u2019s classic Chuck Taylor sneakers.", "images":
