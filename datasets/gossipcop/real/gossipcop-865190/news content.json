The two fielded multiple questions about the network\u2019s poor record with diversity in front of and behind the camera, with one reporter noting that CBS has failed to put a new series with a female lead on the air for two seasons running.\n\n\u201cWe had six pilots with female leads and the way things turned out those pilots were not deemed to be as good as the pilots that were picked up,\u201d Sherman said.\n\nSherman and Kahl did not handle the development slate that led to the upcoming season\u2019s crop of new shows. Kahl, a 21-year veteran of the network and its longtime scheduling chief, was named CBS entertainment president in May. His promotion came with the departure of Glenn Geller, who stepped down as the network\u2019s top programming executive following a mild heart attack suffered in March. As part of the restructuring, Sherman was recruited from sister network the CW to head programming under Kahl.\n\nReporters also grilled Kahl and Sherman on CBS\u2019 casting department, which is staffed entirely by white casting directors, and how it has affected the onscreen diversity or lack thereof in CBS\u2019 series.\n\n\u201cI personally don\u2019t think that has anything to do with it,\u201d Kahl said, adding of the casting department, \u201cThey\u2019re fantastic at what they do,\u201d and noting that it has \u201ccast many diverse roles in the past.\u201d\n\nPressed on why the department is staffed entirely by white casting directors, Sherman said, \u201cThey\u2019ve been together for a long time. That\u2019s the department as its been. But we are cognizant of the issue. We hear you, and we will be looking to expand the casting department.\u201d\n\nAs his predecessors have, Kahl defended CBS\u2019 diversity record and promised it would continue to improve.\n\n\u201cWe can debate the pace of the change, but there is change happening at CBS,\u201d Kahl said, noting an overall uptick in diverse series regulars in recent years. \u201cEvery single drama on our air has at least one diverse regular character.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe said in the past that we\u2019re going to do better, and we are doing better.\u201d", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kelly-kahl-thom-sherman.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kelly-kahl-thom-sherman.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Holloway", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/cbs-tca-1202512241/", "title": "CBS Chiefs: \u2018Hawaii Five-0\u2019 Actors Were Offered \u2018a Lot of Money to Stick Around\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "CBS' programming execs addressed the network's struggles with diversity including the controversy over the departure of two Asian actors from 'Hawaii Five-0.'", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Daniel Holloway", "tags": "CBS, Hawaii Five-0, TCA", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "CBS Chiefs: \u2018Hawaii Five-0\u2019 Actors Were Offered \u2018a Lot of Money to Stick Around\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/cbs-tca-1202512241/", "description": "CBS' programming execs addressed the network's struggles with diversity including the controversy over the departure of two Asian actors from 'Hawaii Five-0.'", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kelly-kahl-thom-sherman.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Kelly Kahl Thom Sherman"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-01T19:20:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-01T19:46:10+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "CBS' programming execs addressed the network's struggles with diversity including the controversy over the departure of two Asian actors from 'Hawaii Five-0.'", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@gdanielholloway", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CBS Chiefs: \u2018Hawaii Five-0\u2019 Actors Were Offered \u2018a Lot of Money to Stick Around\u2019", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/kelly-kahl-thom-sherman.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501615240.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
