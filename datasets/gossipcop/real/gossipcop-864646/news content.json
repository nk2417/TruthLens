AND YOU\u2019RE LITERALLY JUST SITTING IN IT,\u201d King, 27, wrote Saturday alongside a photo of her in a \u201cBorn to be mild\u201d T-shirt.\n\nElle King posted a message about her struggles with depression and PTSD to her Instagram account.\n\nThough she never mentions explicitly what choice she is referring to, she continued her extensive note by explaining that she recently sought help from a doctor for her PTSD, and that the session helped \u201cthe door inside of me open up just a little bit more.\u201d\n\nKing also provided a colorful comparison to help better explain how she\u2019s been dealing with her mental state \u2014 it\u2019s a lot like doing LSD.\n\n\u201cI also realized that PTSD and/or depression FOR ME, and I say for me because I can only speak for myself, is like a trip on LSD,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI realized that when I\u2019ve been in an altered state I HAVE had weird moments and scary thoughts.\u201d\n\nThe singer explained that, just as she\u2019s forced to do when on the drug, the way she plans on combatting her PTSD and depression is by forcing herself to regain control of her own mind.\n\n\u201cToday, if presented with two options, I will CHOOSE the one that is most beneficial and happy for me right then and there,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI\u2019ll make some healthy choices.\u201d\n\nKing, whose father is \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d vet Rob Schneider, has long been known to share intimate details of her personal life with her social media followers.\n\nBack in April, she revealed with an Instagram post that her wedding to fianc\u00e9 Andrew Ferguson had been called off, only to share in May that they had actually been secretly married in February 2016, and had since divorced.\n\n\u201cMy heart is broken. My soul aches. I am lost,\u201d she wrote at the time.\n\nReports later emerged that Ferguson was arrested for domestic violence after allegedly threatening to kill King in April. She did not press charges.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/07/02/CWUXFSLBO462H36BD6RKXMQYGI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/07/02/CWUXFSLBO462H36BD6RKXMQYGI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Desantis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/07/02/elle-king-opens-up-about-battle-with-depression-and-ptsd/", "title": "Elle King opens up about battle with depression and PTSD", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Rachel Desantis", "canonical": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/07/02/elle-king-opens-up-about-battle-with-depression-and-ptsd/"}, "description": "Elle King revealed in an Instagram post that she's staying positive and seeking help as she struggles with both depression and PTSD.", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Elle King opens up about battle with depression and PTSD", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/07/02/elle-king-opens-up-about-battle-with-depression-and-ptsd/", "description": "\u201cEx\u2019s & Oh\u2019s\u201d singer Elle King revealed in a lengthy Instagram post that she\u2019s staying positive and seeking help as she struggles with both depression and post-tr\u2026", "site_name": "New York Daily News", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/07/02/CWUXFSLBO462H36BD6RKXMQYGI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "width": 1024, "height": 670}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-02T14:23:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-06T12:19:38+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Elle King opens up about battle with depression and PTSD"}, "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/07/02/CWUXFSLBO462H36BD6RKXMQYGI.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cropped-DailyNewsCamera-7.webp?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499005431.0, "source": "https://www.nydailynews.com", "summary": ""}
