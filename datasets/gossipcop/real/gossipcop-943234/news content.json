She has also appeared in Steven Spielberg's 2018 adventure film Ready Player One and the HBO series Westworld. In 2023, she received a nomination for Best Play at the 76th Tony Awards, her production work on the sketch-comedy play Ain't No Mo'.\n\nWaithe was named one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People of 2018;[4] and was included on Fast Company's Queer 50 list in 2021 and 2022.[5][6]\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nWaithe was born in Chicago, Illinois.[7][8] Her father, Lawrence David Waithe, died when she was 15.[9] Her paternal great-grandfather, Winston Waithe, emigrated from Barbados to Boston in 1921; his family, descended from enslaved people on sugar plantations, was from Christ Church, Barbados.[9] Though acting was not originally among her ambitions,[10][11] she knew from the age of seven that she wanted to be a television writer and received strong family support for her writing from her single mother and grandmother.[12] Her parents had divorced when she was 3.[13] Waithe and her sister grew up on the South Side of Chicago until Waithe was 12; she attended a local, mostly African-American elementary magnet school, Turner-Drew,[14] but moved to Evanston and finished middle school at Chute Middle School.[15] She graduated from Evanston Township High School and earned a degree in cinema and television arts[16] from Columbia College Chicago in 2006,[17][11][18] praising faculty playwright Michael Fry for his teaching and encouragement.[18][19] Seeking more ways to involve herself in the television and film industry, she also worked at a movie theater, at a Best Buy, and at a Blockbuster.[20]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nHaving arrived in Los Angeles, Waithe secured a job as an assistant to the executive producer of Girlfriends, a long-running sitcom.[20] Soon after, she landed a minor role in Lisa Kudrow's The Comeback.[20] She later became a writer for the Fox television series Bones,[10] a writer for the 2012 Nickelodeon sitcom How to Rock, and a producer on the 2014 satirical comedy film Dear White People.[21] Waithe wrote and appeared in the YouTube series \"Twenties\", produced by Flavor Unit Entertainment and optioned in 2014 by BET.[22][23] In addition to writing and directing the short film \"Save Me\", which was shown at several independent film festivals,[24] Waithe wrote the 2013 web series \"Hello Cupid\" and the 2011 viral video Shit Black Girls Say.[21]\n\nIn 2014, Variety named Waithe one of its \"10 Comedians to Watch\".[22] In August 2015, Showtime commissioned a pilot for an upcoming series, The Chi, written by Waithe and produced by Common, which tells a young urban Black-American man's coming-of-age story.[25] As the show's creator, Waithe wanted to mine her experience growing up on the South Side and experiencing its diversity to craft a story that paints a more nuanced portrait of her hometown than is typically shown.[26] Similarly, she extended her influence to support the Black-American community in the entertainment industry through her role as co-chair of the Committee of Black Writers at the Writers Guild.[15]\n\nIn 2015, Waithe was cast in the Netflix series Master of None after meeting creator and lead actor Aziz Ansari who, with Alan Yang, had originally written Denise as a straight, white woman with the potential, according to Waithe, to evolve into one of the main character's love interests: \"For some reason, [casting director] Allison Jones thought about me for it, a Black gay woman.\"[12] Ansari and Yang rewrote the script to make the character more like Waithe: \"All of us actors play heightened versions of ourselves.\"[12] She said, \"I don't know if we've seen a sly, harem pants-wearing, cool Topshop sweatshirt-wearing, snapback hat-rocking lesbian on TV.\"[10] She also said, \"I know how many women I see out in the world who are very much like myself. We exist. To me, the visibility of it was what was going to be so important and so exciting.\"[10]\n\nIn 2017, Waithe and Ansari won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for the season 2 episode \"Thanksgiving\".[27] She became the first African-American woman to win an Emmy in that category.[27][28][29] Waithe described the episode as based on her coming out experience as a lesbian.[30] During her Emmy speech, she sent a special message to her LGBTQIA (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and Asexual)[31] family discussing how \"The things that make us different\u2014those are our superpowers.\"[32] She ended her speech by recognizing her journey as a Black woman, saying, \"Thank you for embracing a little Indian boy from South Carolina and a little queer Black girl from the South Side of Chicago.\"[33] Waithe also developed an autobiographical drama series, The Chi.[34][35] Out Magazine named Waithe the Out100: Artist of the Year on November 8, 2017.[36]\n\nSince 2018, Waithe has provided the voiceover of the tagline of AT&T commercials.[37] The same year, she became the first Black queer woman since November 2003 to be featured on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine.[38] Waithe also founded her production company, Hillman Grad Productions.[citation needed]\n\nWaithe wrote and produced the road trip-crime film Queen & Slim, starring Jodie Turner-Smith and Daniel Kaluuya, and directed by Melina Matsoukas. It was released on November 27, 2019, by Universal Pictures.[39] This film focuses on powerful social issues such as systemic racism, police brutality and oppression. It has been depicted as a \u201ca meditation on a system of justice that treats innocent people as outlaws,\u201d or \u201ca bourgeois representation of the struggle against police oppression.\"[40] Queen & Slim won a BET Award for Best Movie (2020), Florida Film Critics Circle Award (2019) as well as other awards.[41]\n\nIn 2020, Waithe lent her voice to the Pixar animated film Onward, portraying the cyclops police officer Specter, the first queer animated character in Disney history.[42]\n\nShe focuses on recruiting more people of color and queer artists for her film and television projects.[43] In 2020 her production company, Hillman Grad Productions, opened a mentoring and training program[44] with financial support from the Froneri ice-cream company.[45] More recently, she signed a deal with the Warner Bros. TV Group in order to develop a TV version of Hoop Dreams.[46]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nWaithe became engaged in 2017 to Alana Mayo,[47][48] a content executive. They married in 2019 in San Francisco.[49] On January 23, 2020, Waithe and Mayo announced that they had separated after two months of marriage.[50] In November 2020, Mayo filed for divorce from Waithe; the divorce was finalized by agreement on May 24, 2021.[51] Waithe's relationship with English actress Cynthia Erivo was confirmed in 2024.[52][53]\n\nWaithe has described her family as \"lazy Christians\" and said in 2018, \"I'm a huge believer in God, and Jesus Christ, and that God made me and all those things. And I try to just be a good person. I think that is the base of my religion, is to be good, is to be honest.\"[54]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nActress [ edit ]\n\nWriter [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2012 M.O Diaries Writer TV series How to Rock Writer 2 episodes 2013 Hello Cupid Writer 7 episodes 2014\u20132015 Bones Staff writer 15 episodes 2015, 2017,\n\n2021 Master of None Writer 6 episodes 2018\u2013present The Chi Creator; writer 8 episodes 2019\u20132020 Boomerang Creator; writer; executive producer 4 episodes 2020 Twenties Creator; executive producer 8 episodes\n\nProducer [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2021 Them Executive producer TV series\n\nAwards and nominations [ edit ]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Lena_Waithe_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/960px-Lena_Waithe_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Lena_Waithe_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/250px-Lena_Waithe_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Lena_Waithe_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/960px-Lena_Waithe_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lena_Waithe", "title": "Lena Waithe", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.3", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Lena_Waithe_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg/960px-Lena_Waithe_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg", "width": 872, "height": 1200}, "title": "Lena Waithe - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
