The actor has yet to confirm the widespread rumors of a presidential run, but on The Graham Norton Show recently he suggested why a campaign might be difficult. His co-star in the upcoming film Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Kevin Hart, he says, would \u201ccompletely sabotage the campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the problem. It\u2019s been very flattering that there\u2019s been this really interesting uptick in public opinion wanting that to happen, but the problem is this guy to my right would completely sabotage the campaign,\u201d Johnson said when asked about his political plans for 2020 during a group discussion with Hart, Jessica Chastain, Jack Black and Rebel Wilson.\n\nHart emphatically agreed: \u201c100 percent.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will take you down. I don\u2019t want it to happen because it would make you that much better than me, and I just don\u2019t want that to happen,\u201d he joked with his friend and co-star.\n\nWhen Norton pressed Chastain on whether she would be a \u201ccheerleader\u201d for Johnson, she said she definitely would. \u201cHave you seen his Instagram?\u201d she asked.\n\nRebel Wilson also chimed in, telling Norton she would be \u201cprepared to donate\u201d to a potential Johnson campaign.\n\nThe rumors of a Johnson presidential run picked up steam after the actor told GQ that he thinks a campaign is \u201ca real possibility\u201d in June. In October Johnson continued to fan the flames of fan speculation when he commented, \u201cI think \u2018The People\u2019s President\u2019 has a really nice ring to that. I\u2019ll just say that,\u201d on a panel at Los Angeles Comic Con.\n\nJohnson and Hart appeared on The Graham Norton Show to promote Jumanji, which will be released in theaters Dec. 20.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen_shot_2017-12-08_at_11.14.52_am_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen_shot_2017-12-08_at_11.14.52_am_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Kilkenny", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/dwayne-johnson-jokes-he-may-not-run-president-because-kevin-hart-will-sabotage-campaign-1065826/", "title": "Dwayne Johnson Jokes He May Not Run for President Because Kevin Hart Will \u201cSabotage the Campaign\u201d", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "On 'The Graham Norton Show' the 'Jumanji' actor worries his friend and co-star will ruin his presidential chances, but Jessica Chastain and Rebel Wilson offer their support.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Katie Kilkenny", "tags": "dwayne johnson, international, Kevin Hart, Late Night TV", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Dwayne Johnson Jokes He May Not Run for President Because Kevin Hart Will \u201cSabotage the Campaign\u201d", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/dwayne-johnson-jokes-he-may-not-run-president-because-kevin-hart-will-sabotage-campaign-1065826/", "description": "On 'The Graham Norton Show' the 'Jumanji' actor worries his friend and co-star will ruin his presidential chances, but Jessica Chastain and Rebel Wilson offer their support.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen_shot_2017-12-08_at_11.14.52_am_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Dwayne Johnson Jokes He May Not Run President Because Kevin Hart Will \"Sabotage the Campaign\""}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-08T11:49:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-08T15:15:05+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "On 'The Graham Norton Show' the 'Jumanji' actor worries his friend and co-star will ruin his presidential chances, but Jessica Chastain and Rebel Wilson offer their support.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Dwayne Johnson Jokes He May Not Run for President Because Kevin Hart Will \u201cSabotage the Campaign\u201d", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen_shot_2017-12-08_at_11.14.52_am_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/qXBlB2ZD1rw"], "publish_date": 1512733779.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
