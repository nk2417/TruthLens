Blonde enthusiasts, however, scratched our heads and wondered \u201cNobody goes that blonde that quickly, what magic was involved here?\u201d Her secret, apparently, is nine hours at the salon and an expert coloring team. Yes, nine hours. Brunettes should keep that in mind before bringing a photo of Gomez to a stylist thinking you can go Gomez blonde in your usual hour and a half color appointment.\n\n\u201cIt took 9 hours, about 300 foils, and 8 bowls of bleach, all with 2 stylist working together simultaneously, (@nikkilee901 and myself),\u201d Gomez\u2019s colorist Riawa Capri revealed on Instagram. \u201cIt was a nice long patient process of baby fine slices, then going back and opening each foil and reapplying, but done in one sitting. Anything is possible in one day, it just takes time, no other clients ha, and patience to maintain the integrity of the hair.\u201d\n\nGomez\u2019s second stylist Nikki Lee told US Weekly that Gomez wanted a \u201990s blonde look and jokingly coined her new hair color \u201cNirvana blonde.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing that this was the first major color change Selena\u2019s ever done, it was important to us that her hair remained healthy and the tone was right for her skin. The vibe is \u201990s chic and she named the color #NirvanaBlonde,\u201d Lee told US Weekly.\n\nGomez\u2019s colorist made the blonde hair PSA on her Instagram a few days ago.\n\nso i am blonde now A post shared by Selena Gomez (@selenagomez) on Nov 19, 2017 at 4:21pm PST\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind with newly blonde hair is how easily it can turn yellow if you don\u2019t have celebrity money for frequent salon visits. A great at-home way to keep your strands blonde and not brassy is with purple shampoo. Blondes may have more fun, but they also have the most high maintenance hair ever.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171126062501im_/https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/19105944/selena-gomez1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126062501im_/https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/03023135/xoxo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126062501im_/https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072542/avatar-g-150x150.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126062501im_/https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hg/images/newsletter-illustration.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126062501im_/https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/19105944/selena-gomez1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171126062501/https://hellogiggles.com/hair/hair-color/blond/selena-gomezs-nirvana-blonde-hair-stylist-nine-hours/", "title": "Selena Gomez\u2019s \u201cNirvana Blonde\u201d hair took nine hours to perfect, in case you want to steal her look", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "hair dye,selena gomez,hair color,celeb hair", "news_keywords": "hair dye,selena gomez,hair color,celeb hair", "description": "The secret to Selena Gomez's new blonde hair is nine hours at the salon and an expert coloring team.
