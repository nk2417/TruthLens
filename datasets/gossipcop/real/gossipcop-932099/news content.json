He added that West and his Yeezy footwear brand are a \u201cvery important part of our brand from a revenue standpoint and how we promote our products,\u201d but emphasized the company\u2019s overall strength.\n\nDuring a conversation on \u201cTMZ Live\u201d with Harvey Levin and Charles Latibeaudiere, West said, \u201cWhen you hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years?! That sounds like a choice. You was there for 400 years and it\u2019s all of y\u2019all. It\u2019s like we\u2019re mentally in prison. I like the word \u2018prison\u2019 because \u2018slavery\u2019 goes too direct to the idea of blacks. Slavery is to blacks as the Holocaust is to Jews. Prison is something that unites as one race, blacks and whites, that we\u2019re the human race.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWest also further explained his support of President Donald Trump on the show after tweeting a picture last week of him wearing a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hat.\n\n\u201cI just love Trump,\u201d West said. \u201cThat\u2019s my boy. Like so many rappers\u2014you\u2019ll look at a video of Snoop Dogg loving Trump but then he get in the office and now they don\u2019t want to love him.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump is one of rap\u2019s favorite people,\u201d he concluded.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kanye.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kanye.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Variety Staff", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/adidas-stands-by-kanye-west-despite-slavery-comments-1202796794/", "title": "Adidas Stands by Kanye West, Despite Slavery Comments", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted distanced himself from Kanye West\u2019s controversial slavery comments earlier this week, but said the company has not discussed parting ways with the rapper as a designer.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Variety Staff", "tags": "Adidas, Kanye West", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Adidas Stands by Kanye West, Despite Slavery Comments", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/adidas-stands-by-kanye-west-despite-slavery-comments-1202796794/", "description": "Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted distanced himself from Kanye West\u2019s controversial slavery comments earlier this week, but said the company has not discussed parting ways with the rapper as a designer. \u201cThere clearly are some comments we don\u2019t support,\u201d Rorsted said in an interview with Bloomberg TV, adding that the company plans to talk with West [\u2026]", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kanye.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Kanye West"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-03T15:41:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-03T15:41:42+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Adidas CEO Kasper Rorsted distanced himself from Kanye West\u2019s controversial slavery comments earlier this week, but said the company has not discussed parting ways with the rapper as a designer. \u201cThere clearly are some comments we don\u2019t support,\u201d Rorsted said in an interview with Bloomberg TV, adding that the company plans to talk with West [\u2026]", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@Variety", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Adidas Stands by Kanye West, Despite Slavery Comments", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kanye.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525362102.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
