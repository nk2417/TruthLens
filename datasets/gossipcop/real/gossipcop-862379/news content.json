The Italian fashion designer was the head of her late brother Gianni Versace\u2019s luxury fashion empire for nearly 30 years. She took over the fashion house after his tragic murder in 1997.\n\n\u201cIt has been the greatest honor of my life to carry on my brother Gianni\u2019s legacy. He was the true genius, but I hope I have some of his spirit and tenacity,\u201d Versace said in a statement on March 13.\n\nThe 69-year-old will be replaced by former Miu Miu design director Dario Vitale and will transition to her new role as chief brand ambassador beginning on April 1. \u201cI will remain Versace\u2019s most passionate supporter,\u201d she said. \u201cVersace is in my DNA and always in my heart.\u201d\n\nWho Is Donatella Versace?\n\nDonatella Versace is one of the best-known names in fashion. The Italian designer grew up with two major fashion influences: her mother was a dressmaker and her older brother, Gianni Versace, was a budding designer. She went to work for her brother in the late 1970s, serving as his muse and adviser. Donatella became the designer for the company\u2019s Versus line in the 1980s. After her brother was murdered in 1997, she became Versace\u2019s creative director before stepping down in March 2025. In April, she will assume her new role of chief brand ambassador.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Donatella Francesca Versace\n\nBORN: May 2, 1955\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Reggio Calabria, Italy\n\nSPOUSES: Paul Beck (1983\u20132000) and Manuel Dallori (2004\u20132005)\n\nCHILDREN: Allegra and Daniel\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Taurus\n\nYounger Years\n\nDonatella Francesca Versace was born on May 2, 1955, in Reggio Calabria, Italy. She is the younger sister of the late designer Gianni Versace. Donatella and Gianni learned about designing from their mother, who had a dressmaking business. \u201cI was the baby of the family,\u201d she later explained to The New Yorker. \u201cI was so spoiled. I was the best-dressed little girl in the city.\u201d\n\nVersace began developing her trademark look as a teenager by dying her hair platinum blonde and using dark eyeliner. She was remarkably close to Gianni, who would take her out with him at night and make outfits for her to wear. Donatella attended a university in Florence for a time, but she eventually reunited with her brother to support his clothing business.\n\nVersace Muse and Leader\n\nWhen Gianni started his own fashion company in Milan in 1978, Donatella was right there by his side. Their brother, Santo, was also a part of the business. Gianni relied on Donatella for her advice about his designs, and she played an important role in orchestrating many Versace fashion shows and advertising campaigns. She helped bring some rock \u2019n\u2019 roll spirit and celebrity cache to the line through her friendships with Madonna\ufeff and Elizabeth Hurley\ufeff.\ufeff\n\nGetty Images Gianni and Donatella Versace were professional collaborators in addition to being siblings.\n\nDonatella also served as chief designer for the company\u2019s Versus line. She learned even more about the business in the mid-1990s, when she took on a larger role while Gianni battled cancer. The health scare prompted the Versace siblings to work on a company succession plan. Gianni recovered, but tragically, the succession plan still turned out to be useful when he was shot outside his home in Miami in 1997. \ufeffThe murderer, Andrew Cunanan, had gone on a cross-country killing spree prior to fatally shooting Versace. He then died by suicide.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nDonatella was devastated by the death of her brother but was determined to carry on his legacy. Days after Gianni\u2019s death, she was announced as Versace\u2019s chief creative officer. By this time, though, she had already taken a leading role in the business. \u201cThe last two years of Gianni\u2019s life,\u201d Donatella explained to New York magazine, \u201cI was going up into his apartment, showing him the work, getting the approval from him, but I ran the company because he wasn\u2019t showing himself. It was like a year and a half I did everything.\u201d\n\nDonatella led the company\u2019s design vision in the ensuing decades, helping to reinvigorate its product lines over the years. In 2009, she brought in Christopher Kane to design for Versus and reinvent the brand. After his departure, Versace collaborated with other upcoming designers on the line, also revamping the company\u2019s haute couture line Atelier Versace. Today, Versace markets a variety of product lines\u2014clothing, perfume, home goods, and furniture\u2014and operates two hotels.\n\nIn March 2025, Donatella announced she was stepping down as the brand\u2019s creative director after more than 27 years in the role. She will now serve as Versace\u2019s chief brand ambassador.\n\nMarriages and Children\n\nVersace married former model Paul Beck in 1986. The couple had two children together. Their daughter, Allegra, was born in 1986. Three years later, in 1989, they welcomed their son, Daniel. He was named after a song by close family friend Elton John\ufeff. After 16 years of marriage, Versace and Beck divorced in 2000.\ufeff\n\nKnown for her wild partying lifestyle, Versace battled drug addiction after her brother\u2019s death. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand the pain,\u201d she told Vogue. \u201cI had to hide my feelings. What better way to hide your feelings than with drugs?\u201d After struggling with cocaine addiction for many years, Versace sought treatment in 2004. It was around this time that she was briefly married to Italian businessman Manuel Dallori, whom she divorced less than a year later.\n\nAs part of Gianni\u2019s will, Donatella\u2019s daughter Allegra was given 50 percent of the company\u2019s stake. When she turned 18 in 2004, Allegra inherited her claim, an estimated $500 million. She currently serves as a company director and is also a theatrical dressmaker residing in New York City.\n\n\n\nInfluence in Pop Culture\n\nA fashion icon, Versace was spoofed on Saturday Night Live in a series of sketches, in which she was portrayed by actor and comedian Maya Rudolph\ufeff. Versace seemed to have a good sense of humor about herself, even calling Rudolph to give her advice. In 2013, Versace was portrayed by Gina Gershon in the Lifetime television movie, House of Versace.\n\nPremiering in January 2018, Ryan Murphy\u2019s The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story featured Oscar-winning actor Penelope Cruz\ufeff as Versace. As the anthology series\u2019 second installment, the show focused on the death of her brother Gianni.\n\nNet Worth\n\nAs of March 2025, Versace has an estimated net worth of $400 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.\n\nQuotes\n\nLife is difficult. \u201cHappiness\u201d is a word I do not believe exists.\n\nI don\u2019t know why people make such a fuss about working and being a mother. I think the most important thing is to spend quality time with your children, not quantity.\n\nI was the baby of the family. I was so spoiled. I was the best-dressed little girl in the city.\n\nI had to hide my feelings. What better way to hide your feelings than with drugs?\n\nFact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
