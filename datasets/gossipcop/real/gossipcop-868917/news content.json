According to a source, the pop star made the call on his own after much consideration. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a decision made overnight,\u201d says an insider. \u201cHe\u2019s had some time off and was able to consider his commitments.\u201d To cancel the remainder of the tour, which was headed to Asia (Japan, Hong Kong, Philippines and Singapore) in addition to more U.S. dates (including an Aug. 5 performance at the Rose Bowl), was doable seeing as some tickets went on sale as recently as one week ago, so refunds will be available quickly.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBieber\u2019s 14 called off dates follow a similar move by Adele, who canceled the last two shows of her world tour scheduled for London\u2019s Wembley Stadium, where 100,000 fans were expected nightly. \u201cOn medical advice I simply am unable to perform over the weekend,\u201d she wrote in a post on Facebook. \u201cTo say I\u2019m heart broken would be a complete understatement.\u201d\n\nBieber has not yet commented on social media and reps for the singer were also unavailable for comment.\n\nThrough the first half of 2017, Bieber\u2019s tour grossed $93.2 million with average per date ticket sales of 38,297, according to concert industry trade Pollstar. Bieber will likely face penalties for the U.S. dates, which are typically not insured against cancellation without a medical reason or a \u201cForce Majeure,\u201d which is defined as an unforeseeable circumstance that prevents someone from fulfilling a contract \u2014 like a war or political instability that could put an artist in danger.\n\nA source confirms TMZ\u2019s earlier story that Bieber was \u201cjust over it.\u201d A reporter for the site caught up with Bieber on the beach in Santa Monica, California Monday afternoon. Bieber responded to questions by saying \u201cEverything\u2019s fine \u2026 I\u2019ve been on tour for two years, [I\u2019m going to spend time] resting, relaxation gonna ride some bikes.\u201d Asked whether he had a message for his fans, he said \u201cI love you guys, you\u2019re awesome, I\u2019m sorry for anyone who feels disappointed or betrayed.\u201d\n\nUpdate: A statement announcing the cancellation read:\n\n\u201cDue to unforeseen circumstances, Justin Bieber will cancel the remainder of the Purpose World Tour concerts. Justin loves his fans and hates to disappoint them. He thanks his fans for the incredible experience of the Purpose World Tour over last 18 months. He is grateful and honored to have shared that experience with his cast and crew for over 150 successful shows across six continents during this run. However, after careful consideration, he has decided he will not be performing any further dates. Tickets will be refunded at point of purchase.\u201d", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/justin-bieber-cancels-tour.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/justin-bieber-cancels-tour.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shirley Halperin", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/justin-bieber-cancels-purpose-tour-dates-1202504724/", "title": "Justin Bieber Cancels Remaining \u2018Purpose\u2019 Tour Dates", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "After 154 stadium shows, Justin Bieber is bowing out of the remaining 15 dates of his \"Purpose\" world tour, Variety has confirmed.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Shirley Halperin", "tags": "Justin Bieber", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Justin Bieber Cancels Remaining \u2018Purpose\u2019 Tour Dates", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/justin-bieber-cancels-purpose-tour-dates-1202504724/", "description": "After 154 stadium shows, Justin Bieber is bowing out of the remaining 15 dates of his \"Purpose\" world tour, Variety has confirmed.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/justin-bieber-cancels-tour.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Justin Bieber Cancels Tour"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-24T19:14:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-25T07:20:39+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "After 154 stadium shows, Justin Bieber is bowing out of the remaining 15 dates of his \"Purpose\" world tour, Variety has confirmed.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@shirleyhalperin", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Justin Bieber Cancels Remaining \u2018Purpose\u2019 Tour Dates", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/justin-bieber-cancels-tour.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500923656.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
