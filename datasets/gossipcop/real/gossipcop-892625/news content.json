{"url": "https://people.com/country/cma-awards-2017-what-you-didnt-see/", "text": "Amid a year rife with tragedy and division, the 2017 CMA Awards was a show of music unity, from the feel-good opening number \u2014 an all-star rendition of Hootie and the Blowfish\u2019s \u201cHold My Hand\u201d \u2014 to the night\u2019s speeches: \u201cI feel like we\u2019re bonded together and banded together more than we ever have been,\u201d Miranda Lambert told the crowd as she picked up her female vocalist trophy.\n\nBut behind the scenes, the country love fest seemed even cozier.\n\nTim McGraw and Faith Hill made slow progress back to their front-row seats after singing in the opener because of the number of hugs they gave and received on their way from stage to the floor. (Keith Urban later briefly stole Tim\u2019s seat, jokingly brushing him off so he could be closer to Faith.) Chris Stapleton, meanwhile, sat front and center nearly all night \u2014 and throughout the commercial breaks everyone from Luke Bryan and Darius Rucker to Eric Church paid their respects to the singer and his pregnant wife Morgane with warm hugs.\n\nFellow expectant mom Hillary Scott rubbed her growing belly during a commercial break, while band mate Charles Kelley showed off some impressive seat dancing moves during Brothers Osborne\u2019s performance of \u201cIt Ain\u2019t My Fault.\u201d\n\nJohn Shearer/WireImage\n\nDuring a break, Kimberly Williams-Paisley was the first up to congratulate single of the year winner Urban with a squeeze, but Garth Brooks had already been doling out hearty embraces on the red carpet, notably to a thrilled Midland. The trio\u2019s lead singer Mark Wystrach had earlier told PEOPLE that a \u201chigh point of the year\u201d was the moment he heard Brooks heap praise upon the band in an interview.\n\nSpecial guest Pink sat with daughter Willow in the audience, and when the singer went backstage to prepare for her performance of \u201cBarbies,\u201d she turned to the members of Little Big Town \u2013 who are all parents themselves \u00ad\u2014 to keep an eye on Willow. The group happily fawned over the 6-year-old.\n\nPink with her daughter Willow. Evan Agostini/Invision/AP\n\nLBT also wrapped their arms around Angie Gentry, widow of Troy Gentry, and 15-year-old daughter Kaylee after Dierks Bentley, Rascal Flatts and Eddie Montgomery performed the Montgomery Gentry hit \u201cMy Town\u201d in Troy\u2019s honor. When Montgomery walked backstage, he was stopped several times for pats on the back.\n\nWaiting on a B stage to begin his song \u201cAsk Me How I Know,\u201d Garth Brooks good-naturedly waved his arms and conducted the crowd as they sang along to wife Trisha Yearwood\u2019s 1990 hit \u201cShe\u2019s in Love with the Boy,\u201d which was playing on the loudspeakers during the break. Kelley, a Solo cup in hand, chatted with Yearwood as Brooks performed, and at one point the Lady A singer swayed her back and forth to the music.\n\nKelley was far from the only artist who took advantage of the backstage bar: Lambert returned during a commercial break sipping on a glass as she talked intently to pal Bentley and Thomas Rhett weaved his way through the crowd with a drink in each hand \u2014 until his record label president Scott Borchetta swiped a sip from one of his cups.\n\nWhile wife Carrie Underwood kept the show running with co-host Brad Paisley, Mike Fisher seemed to enjoy the chance to sit in the audience at his first CMA Awards since retiring from the NHL earlier this year. The hockey star shook hands with several stars and sung along to Jon Pardi\u2019s \u201cDirt on My Boots\u201d.\n\nUnderwood\u2019s performance of the traditional hymn \u201cSoftly and Tenderly\u201d honoring those that died both in the country industry and in the Las Vegas shooting tragedy was one of the night\u2019s most poignant moments. The singer wiped away tears after finishing her song, and then a team of helpers escorted her and her dramatic dress backstage.\n\nRick Diamond/Getty\n\nMinutes before the night\u2019s final award was announced, Brooks was canoodling with his wife in the front row, giving her a cuddle and a kiss after taking a selfie together. When his name was announced as Entertainer of the Year, he declared \u201cWe are a family.\u201d And then, making it clear that he does play favorites in one special case, he added, \u201cMs. Yearwood, I am yours forever,\u201d before heading backstage to be greeted with high fives and big hugs from his country brothers and sisters.", "images":
