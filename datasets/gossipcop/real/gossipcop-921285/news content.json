They each give you that something extra. They don\u2019t charge an arm and a leg \u2013 their prices are from $60 for a cut, $100 for colour. They\u2019ve won awards at hair competitions. Bonus: they\u2019re easy to get a last-minute appointment with.

Be it a Maleficent-inspired horn hairdo for a costume party or event-ready hair for a wedding or D&D you need him to do, it all comes easily to him. How do we know? He\u2019s a familiar face in the fashion, editorial and celeb scenes. He creates looks for models and magazine covers, and for local actresses Oon Shu An\u2019s and He Ying Ying\u2019s red-carpet showings, where having the right hair is as important as what you wear. Eng\u2019s customer of three years, Haley Chow, says it\u2019s not just hairstyling skills he has. He\u2019s a good cutter too. Her haircut lasted six months without looking like an unruly mop as it grew out. Another customer raves about his skill in colouring. Because it\u2019s not easy turning brown hair purple without damaging it. Find him at Hairloom, #01-50 Shaw Tower, tel: 6295-2088. From $80 for hairstyling services. Instagram: @bosco_eng; salon instagram @instahairloom ALSO READ: THE BEAUTY TREND EDIT: NYFW AW'18 & 5 WAYS TO KEEP YOUR SKIN IN TIP TOP CONDITIONGo to him for: Cutting & colouring Kawasaki has worked in the hair industry for nine years \u2013 four in Tokyo, and five in Singapore. He specialises in low-maintenance haircuts. You don\u2019t have to spend hours styling your hair after he\u2019s cut it. You could even walk out of the house as is, in the mornings. He\u2019s your go-to guy for drastic changes \u2013 a long cut to a short one, or a natural shade to a wild, bold purple. Four out of five new customers he gets become regulars. Why? He\u2019s gentle. He makes every effort to bleach out uneven tones from previous colouring jobs without damaging the hair. And when your new colour fades after a few months, you\u2019ll merely look as if you have a new shade, and not like you need a touch-up. Find him at Kizuki+Lim, 31 Seah Street, tel: 6221-6320. From $60 for a women\u2019s haircut; $100 for hair colouring.

He can give you the tight, high-volume curls Korean women love, or the natural waves Japanese girls favour. His special instinct for hitting on the right perming temperature for your hair texture means the strands don\u2019t get fried. He wants your curls to be perfect from the start. For him, there\u2019s no such thing as the industry practice of doing a tighter curl that loosens up after a few washes. Instead, he gives you hair treatments during the perm so the curls last longer. After the perm, he goes the extra step of cutting your hair to further shape it. Beauty writer Dione Chen, on whom he did a soft Japanese perm (these usually last about four months), says her curls are still holding well eight months later. Find him at Salon Orient, #01-217/218 Marina Square, tel: 6336-3250. From $280 for a perm. Instagram: @un_kenchong; salon instagram: @salon_orient ALSO READ: THE BEAUTY TREND EDIT: NYFW AW'18 & 5 WAYS TO KEEP YOUR SKIN IN TIP TOP CONDITIONGo to him for: Cutting & colouring If you go to this 13-year industry veteran, your hair will look great. All the time. Really. Want to grow out short hair? Ng can give you a bob that will last six months, no trims needed (and here's how to make them grow faster and stronger). Your hair may feel heavier, but it won\u2019t lose its shape or look overgrown. He\u2019s also skilful at bleaching. Not every colourist can do what he does: carefully bleaching up to the roots with steady hands without hurting your scalp (bleach can burn and irritate the scalp, causing it to itch, scab and peel). Says 27-year-old Denise Taw, a customer of three years: \u201cI\u2019ve done cuts, perms and fancy colours like platinum, green, blue and purple with Den. My hair always looks good and the colour lasts twice as long.\u201d Find him at Prep Luxe, #01-62 Capitol Piazza, tel: 6384-1406. From $95 for a women\u2019s haircut. Instagram: @den_ng_; salon instagram @prepyourhair Right: Ng made this cut on a synthetic wig, which is notoriously hard to do because the strands don\u2019t fall naturally like normal hair does. ALSO READ: THINGS ARE LOOKING ROSY FOR SINGAPORE'S HAIRDRESSING INDUSTRY & HER WORLD SPA AWARDS: 11 EDITOR-APPROVED HAIR SERVICES TO TRY NOWGo to him for: Colouring (ombre & full-head) The hairdresser of eight years is a blending expert. For an ombre look, where two distinct colours \u2013 say, dark brown roots and pastel pink \u2013 blend seamlessly at a point, he knows just which sections of hair to pick up. You\u2019ll end up with graduated colour, not blocks of it. With full-head colour, which can easily look flat and lifeless, he doesn\u2019t use only a single hue. He uses different tones of the same shade in different areas for added shine and depth. Yeo knows what works for you. Even if you don\u2019t. Says Sari Burkhard, a customer of five years: \u201cWhen I wanted a new hair colour, Sandy chose one that suited my personality and skin tone, and I loved it although it wasn\u2019t a colour I had initially considered.\u201d Find him at Evolve Salon, #02-09 Liang Court, tel: 6336-1358. From $150 for hair colouring. Instagram: @__sysysy; salon instagram: @evolve_salon Right: This \u201ccolour job\u201d was done using hard-to-control colour sprays. What\u2019s even more impressive is that it was done on a synthetic wig but still looks natural. ALSO READ: THE BEAUTY TREND EDIT: NYFW AW'18 & 5 WAYS TO KEEP YOUR SKIN IN TIP TOP CONDITIONGo to him for: Colouring (balayage) Teh honed his balayage skills during his national service days. It\u2019s a highlighting technique where several colours come together without obvious streaks. He\u2019s like a van Gogh for hair, using it as a canvas to create an artistic look. He painstakingly paints different sections in varying colours so you can\u2019t pick out distinct highlights. Be prepared to spend at least three hours at the salon. Customers Keryn Wai, 25, and Lynn Koh, 34, say his colours always fade out nicely. Adds Koh: \u201cI\u2019ve never stuck to a hairstylist for long, but Teh\u2019s skills keep me going back.\u201d Find him at Hair Inc., 76A Serangoon Garden Way, tel: 6487-4778. From $258 for balayage.
