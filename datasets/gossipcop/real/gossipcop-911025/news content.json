The case is now closed and the body is ready for pick up,\u201d Ed Winter of the Los Angeles Coroner Office tells Us Weekly on Thursday, February 1.\n\nAs previously reported, the coroner confirmed to Us that the Glee alum died on Tuesday, January 30. Salling was found by a riverbed in the Sunland-Tujunga neighborhood of L.A., and was pronounced dead at the scene. Us confirmed that one of Salling\u2019s family members reported him missing at 3 a.m. before his body was discovered on Tuesday.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Deaths of 2018: Stars We\u2019ve Lost Hollywood lost some of its greats this year.

In October, he agreed to a plea deal that included four to seven years in jail. According to the court documents previously obtained by Us, Salling was also ordered to pay approximately $50,000 in restitution and register as a sex offender after his stint in jail.\n\nHowever, a source close to his child pornography case explained to Us on Wednesday, January 31, that Salling\u2019s estate might not have to pay his victims because he was not sentenced before his death.\n\n\u201cRestitution would be a part of his sentence. The amount of the restitution is determined by the sentencing judge \u2026 He will not be sentenced. Therefore there will be no restitution order,\u201d the insider told Us. \u201cTherefore I doubt that there is anything to take to civil court. Any restitution order would be allocated among multiple known victims.\u201d\n\nThe source added, \u201cI\u2019m not saying that there isn\u2019t some lawyer out there willing to file suit on behalf of someone claiming to be a victim. But I am saying, that there is no order to be enforced, for $50,000 or any other amount on behalf of anyone.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars at Court Chris Brown isn't the only celeb who has faced a judge. See more stars in court such as Taylor Swift, Lindsay Lohan and more.\n\nCriminal defense attorney Troy Slaten, who is not directly involved in Salling\u2019s case, further explained that Salling\u2019s victims would have to file a suit in civil court to pursue any restitution.\n\n\u201cAny victims can sue his estate in civil court and receive monetary awards for damages. These awards \u2026 can be in the neighborhood of hundred of thousands of dollars or even in the millions,\u201d Slaten said. They have to file suit in civil court, if they have not already, which they want to do quickly, because you do not want the estate to distribute assets. That would make it more difficult to collect.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know is in emotional distress or suicidal crisis, please call the Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).", "images":
