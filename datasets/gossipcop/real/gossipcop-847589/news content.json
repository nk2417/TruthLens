Unlike them, C\u00e9line Dion loves the Met Gala. She adores the Met Gala. Monday night marked her first time at the event, and she made sure to make it count.\n\nWearing a bespoke Versace gown and Bulgari jewels, Dion maintained a level of wide-eyed energy and excitement from the moment she hit the carpet, and she never let it falter. While speaking to a reporter for Entertainment Tonight, she took up the woman\u2019s request to crown her with no questions asked, saying \u201cI\u2019d love to.\u201d She proceeded to belt out Sia\u2019s \u201cFreeze You Out\u201d while laying the headpiece on top of the woman\u2019s head.\n\nShe shared with E! that she insisted her gown have a deep pocket to hold her invitation, a tissue, her driver's license, and passport in case no one at the door recognized her. Though if they tried to turn her away, she guaranteed that she\u2019d \u201cstart singing in the middle of the street\u201d to prove her identity.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fbb3dd1deef6dddd1d2501/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fbe01e7738ceefc15b5feb/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59088930d667a1083c46d319/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/sarah-jessica-parker-met-gala-2016.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6900e724719651cf92568024/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5908db5d67a0e37e030ac7a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-celine-dion-met-gala-fun.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e01f436f4223ffe5015ee/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5907d59f16779f27abc0a337/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/met-gala-2017-best-dressed-rihanna.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6910d9c3f337a34950604f6b/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5908a7bb16779f27abc0a364/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/rihanna-met-gala-after-party-outfit.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5907ca5ad667a1083c46d2f7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/met-gala-2017-best-dressed-solange.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691b2fa6aa77a417970d0b71/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69035eb14569ea73fa6937b7/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68f8f985956c6a49dd11aebd/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5908db5fd667a1083c46d334/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/celine-dion-met-gala-fun.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5907dbea67a0e37e030ac75f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/met-gala-2017-best-dressed-cara-delevigne-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690ce036e4de48864a6dff15/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5907c221d667a1083c46d2f5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/t-met-gala-2017-best-dressed-katy-perry.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5908db5d67a0e37e030ac7a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-celine-dion-met-gala-fun.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erika Harwood"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/05/celine-dion-first-met-gala-2017", "title": "C\u00e9line Dion Made Her First Met Gala Truly Count", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Erika Harwood", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "The singer probably had the most fun out of everyone.", "id": "5908db0267a0e37e030ac7a5", "keywords": "vanities,exclude,celine dion,met gala", "news_keywords": "vanities,exclude,celine dion,met gala", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5908db0267a0e37e030ac7a5", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The singer probably had the most fun out of everyone.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5908db5d67a0e37e030ac7a7/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/t-celine-dion-met-gala-fun.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5908db5d67a0e37e030ac7a7/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/t-celine-dion-met-gala-fun.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The singer probably had the most fun out of everyone.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5908db5d67a0e37e030ac7a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-celine-dion-met-gala-fun.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "C\u00e9line Dion Made Her First Met Gala Truly Count", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/05/celine-dion-first-met-gala-2017"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-05-02T19:21:02.705Z", "modified_time": "2017-05-02T19:21:02.705Z", "author": "Erika Harwood"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The singer probably had the most fun out of everyone.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5908db5d67a0e37e030ac7a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-celine-dion-met-gala-fun.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "C\u00e9line Dion Made Her First Met Gala Truly Count"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5908db5d67a0e37e030ac7a7/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/t-celine-dion-met-gala-fun.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google": "nopagereadaloud", "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493752862.705, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
