In fact, he almost turned it down.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t audition for Lucius; I auditioned for Gilderoy Lockhart,\u201d he explained. Afterward, they asked him to read for another part \u2014 one that he knew he didn\u2019t want. (The role of Gilderoy Lockhart, the Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, eventually went to Kenneth Branagh.)\n\n\u201cI was about to go play Captain Hook [in 2003\u2019s Peter Pan] and didn\u2019t want to do two children\u2019s [movie] villains,\u201d Isaacs told Digital Spy of why he was against playing the nefarious wizard.\n\nDespite his hesitation, he did the reading for Lucius Malfoy \u2014 and clearly, he nailed it. But when he got home, he immediately informed his agent that it wasn\u2019t going to happen. \u201cI said to my agent, \u2018When they call, tell them no, thank you very much, I am about to go play Captain Hook.'\u201d\n\nThankfully (for Isaacs and fans of the Harry Potter films), the actor\u2019s agent wasn\u2019t about to take no for an answer. At least not that quickly. He encouraged his client to take the weekend to mull it over, but Isaacs didn\u2019t want to even do that. \u201cI said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t want to think about it \u2014 it\u2019s fun and lovely and flattering but I am not playing two children\u2019s villains!'\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, though, he had a change of heart. \u201c[E]verybody I knew called me \u2014 nieces, nephews, godchildren, and then the parents,\u201d Isaacs told Digital Spy. \u201cThey all tried to persuade me to take the job \u2014 not because they cared about me but because they wanted to visit the set! So, I took the job and thank God I did!\u201d\n\nIsaacs appeared in six of the Harry Potter films \u2014 and he\u2019s open to doing more if the opportunity ever presents itself. \u201cIf [JK Rowling] called me and went, \u2018I want to do a Lucius Malfoy spinoff film,\u2019 she wouldn\u2019t get to the middle of her sentence before I\u2019ve said yes and left my house! But I am not holding my breath for that call.\u201d\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, we would LOVE to see a Lucius Malfoy spinoff movie.\n\nDid you love (or love to hate) Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy?
