Subsequently, dozens of accusers have come forward to allege that Weinstein harassed them, and a handful have accused Weinstein of sexual assault.\n\nThe board has faced uncomfortable questions about how much it knew, with top company figures like Bob Weinstein and president David Glasser saying they knew that Harvey Weinstein could be angry and abusive, and knew that he cheated on his wife, but did not know of his alleged sexual abuses.\n\nLast week, Amazon pulled the plug on a Weinstein Co. project under development from David O. Russell, and took over production of TWC\u2019s \u201cThe Romanoffs.\u201d\n\nThe board fired Weinstein on Oct. 8, citing a violation of the company\u2019s code of ethics. Weinstein\u2019s attorney, Patricia Glaser, has argued that his termination was improper, as the board was aware of several settlements when Weinstein signed his most recent contract in 2015.\n\nBoard member Tarak Ben Ammar announced on Monday that the company was exploring a possible sale to Colony Capital, the private equity firm run by Tom Barrack. Colony Capital provided a cash infusion in an effort to stabilize the company.\n\nLance Maerov, an executive at WPP, is the third remaining board member. As the scandal worsened, five board members resigned. They include Tim Sarnoff, Paul Tudor Jones, Dirk Ziff, Marc Lasry and Richard Koenigsberg.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/harvey-21.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/harvey-21.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gene Maddaus", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/weinstein-co-board-meeting-firing-1202592210/", "title": "Harvey Weinstein Resigns From Weinstein Co.
