Here are the 10 most popular nail colors that have ever existed.\n\nAfter years, or decades, of manicures and pedicures, it's easy to become familiar with certain shades that one might deem classic or popular. We're talking about the sheer neutrals , bright reds, and standout shades that seemingly never go out of style, due to the fact that people keep asking for them again and again. These are the nail colors that you can request at the nail salon, and your nail technician will instantly know what polish bottle you're looking for. Some of these nail colors have been around for generations, and others have simply stuck around by sheer force of popularity.\n\nEssie Ballet Slippers Credit: Essie $10 at Target $11 $9 at Walmart $10 at Ulta For over 40 years, this barely-there pale pink has remained a favorite of celebrities, royals like the late Queen Elizabeth II, and pretty much all of Essie's large customer base. Why? Because it seems to look good on everyone (albeit in different ways on varying skin tones) and works for practically every occasion.\n\nRevlon Red Credit: Amazon $8 $5 at Amazon View on Walmart View on CVS Revlon Red\u2014the color that doesn't need any fancy names, because it happens to be a universally-appealing shade of bright red (and one of the first reds ever). In fact, the brand has been claiming red shade supremacy since the 1930s. This glossy strawberry shade comes off cheerier than any blue-toned red, which also helps it transcend seasons much better than many red polishes.\n\nOPI Funny Bunny Credit: Amazon $12 $9 at Amazon $12 $8 at Walmart $12 at Ulta This might be the reason why white nails have truly never gone out of style\u2014most likely due to the fact that OPI's iconic Funny Bunny isn't stark or harsh, but rather a soft, milky shade that acts like the perfect neutral when you do not want pink. However, a pro tip is to layer Funny Bunny with Ballet Slippers for a milkier, less-pigmented sheer pink.\n\nChanel Rouge Noir Credit: Chanel View on Chanel.com Debuted at Paris Fashion Week in the mid-1990s, this iconic shade can make anyone feel an unheard-of amount of confidence. Perhaps that is why it's one of the most coveted lacquers ever made. The vampy black cherry color is especially ideal for fall and winter.\n\nDior Rouge 999 Credit: Dior View on Amazon View on Dior.com In 1953, Christian Dior sought the perfect red to complement his designs, and he found it in this polish bottle. This is Dior's hero hue, which comes through in a shade so true and pigmented that you'll feel like a 50s starlet upon first swipe. You can also find similar shades in the brand's popular lipstick and glosses.", "images":
