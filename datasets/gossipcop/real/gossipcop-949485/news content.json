They were joined by her friend Anna Collins, her cousin and her godson Priscilla DeLeon and Aiden, and Henrie's producer friend Andrea Iervolino among others. (Gomez recently went on an Italian vacation with Iervolino and Henrie, and she also attended the Children's Hospital of Orange County prom with Iervolino.)\n\nInstagram\n\nThe group watched fireworks, hung by the pool, and went to an amusement park. A July 4th for the 'gram, to be sure :\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram\n\n\n\n\n\nGomez shared three Instagrams of the day. \"Hope everyone had a great 4th of July! Spent mine with some of my favorite people @disney,\" she wrote. Henrie commented on the last one with a joke, writing, \"Of course all I get is one handful of popcorn u have the whole bag. And a pickle.\" Classic Justin Russo humor.\n\nInstagram", "images": ["https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/envelope-simple-regular.91a0134.svg",
