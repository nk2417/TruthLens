We are so close that no matter what, we will always get advice from each other. I literally FaceTimed him at 2 a.m. the other day with a million swatches on my face. I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t decide which swatch and what shade this product should be,\u201d and he told me which was best.\n\nYou two have been moving toward a more natural look, with less contour.\n\nYes, but I\u2019ve always stayed true to contour. I\u2019d say that for the past six months, I haven\u2019t been wearing much makeup, but I try to have a little bit of a bronzy look that\u2019s really beautiful and really creamy-looking. That\u2019s why the sticks are cream. There\u2019s no setting powder. But you can make it a heavier contour by adding a setting powder on top of the cream contour.\n\nWhy did you move to a more low-maintenance look?\n\nHaving kids really changes it up.\n\nA lot of the social media-driven brands are targeting a younger shopper \u2014 more a 20-something millennial \u2014 but perhaps the quality of the product isn\u2019t there. Being a mom, and being in your 30s, what\u2019s your focus going to be?\n\nWhen we get to my concealers, I\u2019ll have anti-aging formulas. That\u2019s really important to me \u2014 and, of course, the quality. In the beginning, this line will really be about all the correcting and perfecting tricks I\u2019ve learned. There\u2019s the cream contour. There will also be powder contour and undereye concealer. I\u2019ve always had dark undereye circles from being Armenian. These are the things I feel like I\u2019ve really perfected.\n\nDefinitely that\u2019s part of your image. Speaking of image, tell me about your side to the blackface controversy.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/19/fashion/19KIMweb5/19KIMweb5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=77330e6bea580978c91ce3ba59568a34ae66a785e2daf44b88e86c8a3438b6b8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/19/fashion/19KIMweb5/19KIMweb5-thumbLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/19/fashion/19KIMweb5/19KIMweb5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=77330e6bea580978c91ce3ba59568a34ae66a785e2daf44b88e86c8a3438b6b8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bee Shapiro"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/fashion/kim-kardashian-beauty-line-blackface-allegations.html", "title": "Kim Kardashian West on Her New Beauty Line and Those Blackface Allegations", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "With KKW Beauty, the social media celebrity follows in her sister Kylie Jenner\u2019s footsteps.", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/fashion/kim-kardashian-beauty-line-blackface-allegations.html", "title": "Kim Kardashian West on Her New Beauty Line and Those Blackface Allegations (Published 2017)", "description": "With KKW Beauty, the social media celebrity follows in her sister Kylie Jenner\u2019s footsteps.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/19/fashion/19KIMweb5/19KIMweb5-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg?year=2017&h=901&w=1600&s=a07accce09292b48cd541d65dc6862eb3860dcee2472c1777313f0e9d2c34006&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1", "alt": "Kim Kardashian West at the Forbes Women\u2019s Summit in New York earlier this month.
