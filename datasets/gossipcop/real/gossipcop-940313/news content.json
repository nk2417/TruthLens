The next day, late-night hosts latched onto the comment, jokingly casting racism as a possible side effect to the medication in spoof ads.\n\nBarr first blamed the medication on the tweet that caused a firestorm in a few tweets on Tuesday: \u201cguys I did something unforgiveable so do not defend me. It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting,\u201d she said in one, and added that she had \u201cdone weird stuff while on ambien-cracked eggs on the wall at 2am etc \u2013\u201d in another.\n\nThe medication\u2019s manufacturer, Sanofi U.S., responded to the comments on Wednesday (May 30), tweeting, \u201cPeople of all races, religions and nationalities work at Sanofi every day to improve the lives of people around the world. While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication.\u201d\n\nOn Comedy Central, The Daily Show host Trevor Noah joked, \u201cIf you listen to their ads, there is a subtle warning about just [racism].\u201d\n\nThe ad that followed showed stock images of doctors and a person stretching in the morning, while the voiceover said, \u201cSide effects of Ambien include nausea, diarrhea and sudden racism.\u201d It continued, \u201cDo not operate social media while taking Ambien because it may lead to sitcom loss\u201d as the advertisement showed a television playing a Roseanne Barr speech blow up in a desert.\n\nThe voiceover then said, \u201cIf you feel sudden racism while on Ambien, don\u2019t leave your house. If you must say the n-word, scream it into a pillow until the feeling passes. If Ambien is taken on Memorial Day, racist side effects are amplified, for some reason. If you suddenly wake up and you\u2019re at a Klan rally, contact your doctor immediately \u2014 unless he\u2019s black, because then you\u2019ll probably just call him a monkey.\u201d\n\nOn Full Frontal, a fake ad for the drug showed images of individuals struggling to fall asleep with a voiceover narration stating, \u201cIf sleeping through the night feels like a far away dream, try Ambien, the prescription sleep aid that helps you get a good night\u2019s sleep and possibly makes you racist? I mean, you were already racist but maybe Ambien made it worse?\u201d\n\nThe ad goes on to state that users should use Ambien if \u201cyou\u2019ve ever asked when will there be a White History Month,\u201d used the phrase \u201cI\u2019m not racist, but \u2026\u201d and \u201cif you\u2019ve previously tweeted racist things that your boss forgot about.\u201d The latter statement was accompanied by an old tweet by Barr.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Hollywood Reporter.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/ambien-late-night-full-frontal-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=628&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/ambien-late-night-full-frontal-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/ambien-late-night-full-frontal-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Kilkenny", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/culture/tv-film/samantha-bee-trevor-noah-spoof-ambien-ads-roseanne-barr-racist-tweet-8458653/", "title": "Late-Night Hosts Spoof Ambien Ads Following Roseanne Barr Racist Tweet", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "After she lost her ABC show and talent agency due to a racist tweet, Roseanne Barr blamed the insomnia medication Ambien for the controversial comment in several tweets on Tuesday (May 29).", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Katie Kilkenny", "tags": "bbnews, Samantha Bee", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Late-Night Hosts Spoof Ambien Ads Following Roseanne Barr Racist Tweet", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/culture/tv-film/samantha-bee-trevor-noah-spoof-ambien-ads-roseanne-barr-racist-tweet-8458653/", "description": "After she lost her ABC show and talent agency due to a racist tweet, Roseanne Barr blamed the insomnia medication Ambien for the controversial comment in several tweets on Tuesday (May 29).
