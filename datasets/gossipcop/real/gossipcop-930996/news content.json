The Vanderpump Rules season finale was a roller coaster of emotions as Lisa Vanderpump, queen of re-hiring people she\u2019s fired, once again severed ties with one of the SUR employees. This time it was Jax Taylor, who left the job on his own accord when Lisa suggested he resign following his public outburst that involved him giving Lisa and her husband, Ken Todd, the finger and telling them to \u201cF\u2014k off.\u201d\n\nJax, who had recently ended his relationship with longtime girlfriend Brittany Cartwright, seemed to struggle in this explosive finale. Still in the throes of deciding to take a hypothetical hockey marketing job out of Florida, Jax appeared to be determined to stay in LA and, more specifically, in his current apartment building. While getting ready for a night out, Brittany recounted, \u201cJax was like, \u2018If I\u2019m moving out, I\u2019m probably gonna stay in the same building.\u2019\u201d She added, \u201cIf Jax is gonna stay in the apartment building I might leave the apartment building.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Couples Who Stayed Together After Cheating Scandals Many Hollywood marriages have overcome allegations of infidelity over the years.

Sparks flew when Brittany gushed about new barback Adam Spott, saying, \u201cI never texted a guy and had them be as respectful as Adam has. I texted him a few hours after I was single.\u201d Adam responded, \u201cI\u2019m not trying to cause problems \u2026 She\u2019s beautiful. I\u2019ve said that. And, just like, a good person.\u201d\n\nTensions rose between the freshly broken up duo when Brittany confronted Jax at the event saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not moving down the hall.\u201d He swiftly insisted that she didn\u2019t own the apartment and that he would remain in the building. Since the finale, the duo appear to have reunited.\n\nRelated: Couples Who\u2019ve Survived the Reality TV Curse Who says true love doesn\u2019t exist on reality TV?

The timing [\u2026]\n\nJax Resigns From SUR\n\nWhen it came time for Jax to sit down with Lisa, emotions were high. Jax\u2019s eyes began to water as he confessed, \u201cI really am sorry. I\u2019ve ruined everybody\u2019s life. I have. I don\u2019t know what to do anymore.\u201d Short on sympathy for the 38-year-old bartender, Lisa responded, \u201cGrow the f\u2014k up.\u201d She then explained that she didn\u2019t want to fire Jax because it would give him the satisfaction of being a \u201cvictim.\u201d She added, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you hand me your f\u2014king resignation.\u201d Jax agreed.\n\nRelated: Reality TV\u2019s Breakout Stars From Honey Boo Boo to the Real Housewives, see which celebs make for must-see TV\n\nAfter he left, Lisa approached to the newly re-hired James Kennedy and said, \u201cWe might be looking for a new bartender at SUR.\u201d\n\nStassi\u2019s Ex Won\u2019t Stop Commenting On Lisa\u2019s \u2018Ass\u2019\n\nJax\u2019s drama aside, the most bizarre moment of the night had to be when Stassi Schroeder\u2019s now ex-boyfriend, Patrick Meagher, boldly commented on Lisa\u2019s \u201cass\u201d no less than four separate times to her face. It was clear that she was uncomfortable by the remarks. Patrick\u2019s objectifying statements to Lisa began when he said, \u201cI liked watching you walk away, to be honest with you.\u201d\n\nWhen Lisa tried to diffuse the comments with a joke, he doubled down and insisted, \u201cOh no, I was definitely saying your ass.\u201d\n\nAs Lisa attempted to leave the awkward conversation, Patrick made sure to mention her \u201cgood ass\u201d several more times. Lisa was not happy, admitting in a testimonial shot, \u201cWhat is your problem? I\u2019m old enough to be his mother and he hits on me in front of his girlfriend who also used to work for me.\u201d Following this cringe-worthy interaction, Stassi and Patrick split for good in August 2017.\n\nTell Us: What did you think of the Vanderpump Rules finale?", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
