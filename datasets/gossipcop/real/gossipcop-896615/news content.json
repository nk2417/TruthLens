Sophia Bush joined Anna Faris\u2019 \u201cUnqualified\u201d podcast to talk all things women empowerment and relationships from the past. The actress, who\u2019s set to star in CBS\u2019 upcoming drama Surveillance, opened up about her past romances and what she\u2019s learned over the years.\n\nRelated: TV\u2019s Shadiest Behind-the-Scenes Shakeups Drama alert! Not everyone gets along at work, but when it comes to TV, some of the drama behind the scenes turns into next-level clashes. Us Weekly has gathered just a few of the scandalous troubles that happened off-camera that ultimately changed things on camera. When Katherine Heigl exited Grey\u2019s Anatomy in 2010, she said [\u2026]\n\n\u201cWhen I look back at the way I have operated \u2013 also by the way as a serial monogamist for a long time, and stuck in relationships that were not good for me \u2013 I now look back and go, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s not my fault, it\u2019s not their fault.\u2019 Even the guys who f\u2013ked up so bad\u2014and I\u2019ve had a handful,\u201d Bush, 36, revealed to Faris in the interview published on Tuesday, December 4. \u201cWhat I realize is that I have to own my role in it, because more often than not, I have chosen to date the potential I see in someone and not who somebody is in this current moment. And that\u2019s not to throw shade at anybody. That\u2019s simply to say, I settled for less, and maybe that\u2019s because I came into the world like a little Ruth Bader Ginsburg and was like an old woman from time that I was born, and the guys just haven\u2019t caught up? I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe Chicago P.D. alum, who was briefly married to her former One Tree Hill costar Chad Michael Murray and has been in multiple public relationships since, has been single for years now.\n\n\u201cWhen I got off a rollercoaster in my last relationship with a person who I love but who like, the relationship was so bad for me, I finally went, \u2018Enough! Just enough! I\u2019m good, I\u2019m done,'\u201d the actress said. \u201cI have companionship because I have the most tremendous community. My friends are so special and amazing, they are like ride-or-die, travel the world, show up at 2 a.m., like, good humans.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Exes Who Have Worked Together After a Split Breaking up is hard to do, but sometimes exes still have to work together on the big screen. The process is easier for some than others. Blake Lively and Penn Badgley, for instance, dated during the early seasons of Gossip Girl. After splitting in 2010, Lively and Badgley continued to costar on the CW hit. [\u2026]\n\nShe added: \u201cI realized that if I wasn\u2019t as patient with myself or as loving to myself as I\u2019ve been with partners who just didn\u2019t, at the end of the day, deserve it. Again, that\u2019s not a hateful thing, it\u2019s just to say like, \u2018You don\u2019t deserve this piece of me.\u2019 That\u2019s OK, I f\u2013ked up giving it to you when you didn\u2019t deserve it and I gotta own that I don\u2019t deserve to treat myself that way either. Now for the last couple of years, I\u2019ve gone on some dates. There have been two or three lovely dudes who I\u2019ve seen for a moment and then have gone, \u2018You\u2019re great, but you\u2019re not my guy.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the past, she\u2019s dated Chicago P.D.\u2019s Jesse Lee Soffer and former One Tree Hill star Austin Nichols, the latter who she revealed she\u2019s actually still close with.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really nice that the majority of my long-term serial monogamist relationships, these two and three-year beautiful learning experiences that I\u2019ve had, we\u2019re all friends,\u201d the activist revealed. \u201cMy ex that I went with dressed as Katy [Perry] and Russell [Brand], we saw each other three weeks ago for lunch. We love each other!\u201d\n\nHowever, she now knows what she\u2019s looking for and will not settle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so unwilling to offer any of my limited free time to any man who isn\u2019t, like, the man. My girlfriend said this to me, \u2018No more princes. A man shows up as a king for you or nothing,\u2019\u201d Bush said. \u201cAnd like, yeah, I built my own castle. I\u2019m good. I don\u2019t need you for anything so you better be a value add.\u201d\n\nWith that, Faris added, \u201cBuild your own ladder, I\u2019m not growing my hair out.\u201d", "images":
