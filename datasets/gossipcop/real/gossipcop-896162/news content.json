Look back at some of the biggest villains who wreaked havoc in shows like \u2018Survivor,\u2019 \u2018The Bachelor,\u2019 \u2018Big Brother\u2019 and the \u2018Real Housewives\u2019 franchise!\n\n\u201cMy podcast is an outlet for me to share my unfiltered opinion with my listeners, but on my latest episode, I crossed a line,\u201d she said in a statement she tweeted on Saturday, November 25. \u201cIt was irresponsible for me to make generalized statements about a very serious topic, such as sexual harassment, as it is not my place to speak about anyone else\u2019s experiences.\u201d\n\n\u201cI apologize,\u201d she continued. \u201cI will continue to speak my mind on my podcast, but will put more thought behind my dialogue moving forward.\u201d\n\nShe also tweeted, \u201cThese 24 hours have been sobering: I want to share your stories on my podcast: on either side, being accused of something you didn\u2019t do or being victimized & left helpless. Let\u2019s discuss it all.\u201d\n\nThese 24 hours have been sobering: I want to share your stories on my podcast: on either side, being accused of something you didn't do or being victimized & left helpless. Let\u2019s discuss it all. Stassi@juststassi.com \u2014 Stassi Schroeder (@stassi) November 26, 2017\n\nAs previously reported, the Vanderpump Rules star, 29, referenced victims of sexual assault on her Straight Up With Stassi podcast in a since-deleted episode called \u201cAre We on a Male Witch Hunt?\u201d Schroeder claimed that many victims were originally \u201cwilling\u201d to go to hotel rooms and were only speaking out against sexual harassment now because of the \u201chashtag me too trend.\u201d She also stated that \u201cno one can make me suck someone\u2019s d\u2013k.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars Who Got Their Start on Reality TV The road to success in Hollywood is a little different for every would-be actor, but these days, reality TV is becoming a major launching pad for some of the industry's biggest stars. Before they were red-carpet regulars, NeNe Leakes, Jennifer Hudson, Julianne Hough and Lucy Hale were among those who broke through as reality stars\n\nMany listeners were outraged with what they perceived to be insensitive views and took to Twitter to express their disgust. Advertisers \u2014 including Rent The Runway, Simple Contacts and Framebridge \u2014 also spoke out against Schroeder\u2019s comments and publicly terminated their business relationships with her.\n\nSome fans were not swayed by the reality star\u2019s mea culpa and accused her of apologizing only for the sake of her business.\n\nRelated: Reality TV\u2019s Breakout Stars From Honey Boo Boo to the Real Housewives, see which celebs make for must-see TV\n\nOne fan wrote, \u201cThanks for the apology but this should have been your FIRST response instead dismissing everyone and retweeting people who were agreeing with your harmful opinions.\u201d\n\nAnother wrote, \u201cyou\u2019re only backpeddling now because you\u2019ve lost advertisers for your podcast. Too late for apologies, we truly know how you feel. #Victimblaming or #victimshaming is something u won\u2019t understand because it hasn\u2019t happened to you #MeToo.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say this after tweeting that you only deleted the episode because people \u2018weren\u2019t ready\u2019 to hear what you had to say? Too late for this bullshit PR move to save you. The damage is done,\u201d tweeted another.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
