Learn about our methodology here, and find all our Best in Class guides here. Photo: Marcus McDonald\n\nA white button-down shirt is just about as versatile as a piece of clothing gets. What else works equally well for a job interview, a late-night drink, and over a bikini? That said, sometimes you might want a specific kind of white button-down for a specific occasion \u2014 say, a linen one for vacation or a silk one for a date. With that in mind, I reached out to a number of women with admirable tastes \u2014 including stylists, designers, and brand founders \u2014 about the button-downs they wear most often. I tried a few of these out myself \u2014 checking for fit, especially, and the feeling of the fabric. Below, you\u2019ll find the best white button-downs for women, from the fitted to the oversize. And for more button-downs, we have guides to the best button-downs for bigger busts, best white button-downs for men, and best Oxford shirts.\n\n\ufeffUpdated on September 19, 2025\n\n\ufeffWe checked the prices and stock of all products. Lululemon\u2019s Relaxed-Fit Cotton-Blend Poplin Button-Down Shirt is currently out of stock, while J.Crew\u2019s Gar\u00e7on Classic Shirt is on sale for $70 now (from $98).\n\nOur top picks\n\nWhat we\u2019re looking for Sizes As always with any kind of apparel, we\u2019re focused on featuring button-downs offered in a wider selection of sizes rather than the frustratingly limited (but all too common) small-to-large range. Fabric Traditionally, cotton is the material of choice for button-downs, so that\u2019s what most of the ones on this list are made of. It\u2019s cheaper (compared to something like silk) and wears well, especially on the wrinkle-fighting front (unlike linen). Design details The old rule that a button-down must have buttons on the collar points (similar to a men\u2019s Oxford shirt) isn\u2019t really enforced in modern womenswear. In fact, button-down and button-up are used interchangeably to refer to any shirt with a row of buttons and a collar. Beyond those foundational details, anything\u2019s really fair game, whether that\u2019s pockets, ruffle pleats, curved hems, or puffed sleeves. I made sure to list the details of each shirt for easy reference. Just note that our panelists generally favored oversize styles (think Carrie Bradshaw\u2019s post-pond look versus Carolina Herrera\u2019s runway-ready tops). Price The cost-per-wear philosophy is helpful here \u2014 it makes sense to invest in a button-down since it\u2019s pretty much dress code\u2013proof. But my focus was on finding high-quality shirts that are actually worth what they cost, and whenever one was pricier, I tried to include an affordable alternative. The ones that made it onto this list are categorized as either under $50 ($), under $150 ($$), or over $150 ($$$).\n\nBest white button-down overall\n\nSaved View Want to be emailed when products you\u2019ve saved are over 20% off?

AYR The Deep End Shirt - White $145 Sizes: XS\u2013XL | Fabric: Cotton | Design details: Big patch pocket, curved hem | Price: $$ As I set out to make this guide, I imagined what the best button-down looked like: loose, with sleeves that could be cuffed at the elbow, and not sheer in the slightest. (Really, Ina Garten\u2019s Hamptons uniform, thinking back on it.) The Deep End Shirt is just that. The lines of the silhouette just feel right, from the flattering seam across the shoulders to the curved hem that falls perfectly, and is neither too long nor too short. When I talked to Kate Sokolov, co-founder of Social Goods and a fan of this top, she suggested sizing down, and so I did. This meant the shirt just brushed against the shape of my body but wasn\u2019t so billowing that my waist got lost. (If you prefer a looser fit, I\u2019d say go for your regular size.) What convinced me that this was the best white button-down on the market was that it didn\u2019t feel too buttoned-up. I can wear it with just about anything, from old jeans to itty-bitty shorts. And as Iva Pawling, founder of Richer Poorer, says, \u201cI feel put together but not trying too hard.\u201d The Oxford cotton \u2014 milled in Italy \u2014 that the shirt is made from has a pleasing weightiness, too, and reminds me of old Ralph Lauren button-downs. (If you prefer a different material, the shirt comes in chambray and linen too.) $145 at Ayr Buy\n\nBest (less-expensive) white button-down\n\nSaved View Want to be emailed when products you\u2019ve saved are over 20% off?

Everlane The Boxy Oxford $98 $98 Sizes: XXS\u2013XXL | Fabric: Cotton | Design details: Point collar, dropped shoulders, big patch pockets | Price: $ When I reached out to stylish women for this story, Everlane was the brand mentioned the most \u2014 \u201cFor the price, you can\u2019t do much better\u201d was the general sentiment I heard \u2014 and out of all the button-downs I tried, Everlane\u2019s Boxy Oxford is the closest to Ayr\u2019s Deep End. It comes with big patch pockets (two instead of one), dropped shoulder seams, and a curved hem (with cutouts on the sides \u2014 as seen here). And while the fit is similar to Ayr\u2019s, the main difference is that the Boxy Oxford is squarer in shape. I liked that about it; the Oxford is very \u201cI borrowed this shirt from someone else\u2019s closet.\u201d It also looks just as nice buttoned up as it does unbuttoned (usually, button-downs only look good one way or the other, in my opinion). It\u2019s a real steal at $88, making it an affordable alternative to our best-in-class button-down. Other Everlane button-downs of note: the Relaxed Oxford and Way-Short. Bum-Cake Vintage owner Christiana Greene likes that the first is a little oversize. Blogger Kristina Zias agrees: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the most \u2018flattering\u2019 shirt \u2014 I wear it unbuttoned.\u201d Blogger Hailey Rizzo thinks the second is \u201ccropped but not too cropped,\u201d making it ideal for anyone hunting for a slightly shorter button-down. $98 at Everlane Buy\n\nBest white button-down for plus sizes\n\nSaved View Want to be emailed when products you\u2019ve saved are over 20% off?

Old Navy Oversized Boyfriend Shirt $40 $40 Sizes: XS\u20134X (with petite and tall options) | Fabric: Cotton | Design details: Spread collar, patch pocket, curved hem | Price: $ Plus-size cuts have evolved over the years and become better fitting in the process. Content creator Nikki Apostolou \u2014 who is one of my go-to sources for plus-size fashion coverage \u2014 cites this button-down as one such example. She praises the boyfriend-style fit, which falls to the thighs rather than the top of the hips. And while it\u2019s meant to be oversize, it\u2019s not so oversize that you lose your shape entirely when it\u2019s on. \u201cIf you have nothing to wear, reach for this and you do,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is one of those pieces that works for any outfit.\u201d The shirt is made from a cotton poplin that\u2019s thin and delicate, according to writer Mya Gelber, who tried it on as part of her hunt for the perfect white button-down. It\u2019s \u201csomething to throw over a swimsuit or for a stroll to the farmers\u2019 market,\u201d Gelber says. The Old Navy number comes in at just under $40 \u2014 and is often marked down \u2014 making it the cheapest button-down on this list. $40 at Old Navy Buy\n\nBest fitted white button-down\n\nSaved View Want to be emailed when products you\u2019ve saved are over 20% off?

J.Crew Gar\u00e7on Classic Shirt $75 $98 now 24% off $75 Sizes: 00-24 | Fabric: Cotton poplin | Design details: Bigger patch pocket | Price: $$ I\u2019d be remiss not to include J.Crew on this list \u2014 I\u2019ve been buying its button-downs for close to a decade. I feel well dressed in the shirts, which are well made and well tailored from a material that feels more expensive than it is. Even as someone who\u2019s bustier, curvier, and shorter, I find that J.Crew just gets the fit right. Each season, there are new additions to its line of shirts \u2014 everything from embellished numbers to pin-striped options. Under the creative direction of Olympia Gayot, the brand\u2019s signature button-downs are now called the Gar\u00e7on and \u00c9tienne, which are fully stocked currently. The Gar\u00e7on is slimmer and more fitted than the \u00c9tienne (something I noticed with the brand\u2019s button-downs overall is they\u2019re now made to fit slightly smaller, so keep that in mind while shopping and size up if you want a roomier fit). The Gar\u00e7on, which is made of crisp cotton poplin, is also available in sizes 00 to 24 (plus petite and tall), one of the largest size ranges on this list. $75 at J.Crew Buy\n\nBest (splurgeworthy) fitted white button-down\n\nSaved View Want to be emailed when products you\u2019ve saved are over 20% off?

Classic Six Donna Button-Down Shirt $195 $195 Sizes: 0\u201314 | Fabric: Cotton | Design details: Long cuffs, side slits, French seams, grosgrain detailing, and pearl buttons | Price: $$$ Classic Six\u2019s Donna Shirt is fitted, too, with extra-long cuffs designed to hit past the wrist. Style coach Kim Hancher likes the playful touch. \u201cIt\u2019s always fun to have an interesting detail on a basic, which a white shirt is,\u201d she says. (The Donna also has convenient buttons on the cuffs that make it easy to double them up if you want them out of your way.) Though it\u2019s a more tailored take than the more oversize options above, it\u2019s designed with dropped shoulders and a \u201ctorso [long enough] that it stays tucked in.\u201d Hancher explains that she usually has to size up to get that kind of length, but \u201cthen it\u2019s big all over, which is sometimes a look I want, sometimes not.\u201d According to Hancher, the proportions on this shirt are pretty much perfect, with a larger collar and nipped-in waist. \u201cIt\u2019s just a white shirt, but it adds so much to every outfit that I wear it with,\u201d Hancher says. Another splurge-worthy contender: styles from French label Anne Fontaine \u2014 the \u201cmaster of the white shirt,\u201d according to stylist Jessica Cadmus \u2014 which have a \u201ctrim and tailored\u201d silhouette, with eye-catching details, like Shakespearean ruffles. $195 at Classic Six Buy\n\nBest relaxed-fit white button-down\n\nSaved View Want to be emailed when products you\u2019ve saved are over 20% off?

Lululemon Relaxed-Fit Cotton-Blend Poplin Button-Down Shirt $98 $98 Sizes: XS\u2013XL | Fabric: Cotton, nylon, elastane | Design: Single patch pocket, wide cuffs, and box pleat on back yoke | Price: $$ If you want a button-down that falls between fitted and oversize, you\u2019ll want to look for one billed as \u201crelaxed fit\u201d (sometimes simply called \u201crelaxed\u201d). It\u2019s the silhouette Gelber had in mind when she began her button-down hunt, which included trying on shirts at Alex Mill and J.Crew and placing orders at Gap and Land\u2019s End. More than two dozen button-downs later, Gelber found a winner in Lululemon\u2019s. Lululemon might not be the brand that comes to mind when you hear the word \u201cbutton-down,\u201d but its Relaxed-Fit Cotton-Blend Poplin Button-Down Shirt (the only one it currently sells for women) fits her strict standards. It looks just as good tucked or untucked and has a longer, bum-covering length, along with \u201cbig stiff cuffs as well as a structured collar and a back box pleat that makes it billow really beautifully,\u201d she says. And because it\u2019s from Lululemon, it\u2019s lightweight, quick-drying, and sweat-wicking too. Editor\u2019s note: This shirt is currently sold out in all sizes.

Maeve The Bennet Buttondown Shirt $98 $98 Sizes: XXS\u20133X | Fabric: Cotton | Design: Single patch pocket, high-low shirttail hem | Price: $$ Up until recently, most of Anthropologie\u2019s button-downs were under the label Cloth & Stone. But when I interviewed Anthropologie employees last year, I learned that the Bennet Buttondown from Maeve, an in-house line, is what\u2019s hanging in stores now. The latest iteration is a hit with customers and employees alike: \u201cThey got the proportions of it really right,\u201d a display coordinator says. A manager told me that the button-down has an oversize silhouette and recommended sizing down if you want something more fitted. I\u2019m especially impressed with the shirt\u2019s size inclusiveness: It comes in sizes XXS through 3X (along with a petite length). Even better: There\u2019s an adaptive version for those who have disabilities \u2014 with magnetic snap closures, a tab on the sleeve cuffs (rather than buttons), and a higher shirttail slits (for more coverage). I\u2019d like to give Baserange\u2019s \u201clavishly oversize\u201d Ole Shirt an honorable mention in this category, too \u2014 Strategist writer Erin Schwartz says it\u2019s \u201cso crisp you could crack an egg on it.\u201d $98 at Anthropologie Buy\n\nBest white linen button-down\n\nSaved View Want to be emailed when products you\u2019ve saved are over 20% off?

Frank & Eileen Eileen Linen Button-Up Shirt $258 $258 Sizes: XXS\u2013XL | Fabric: Linen | Design: Looser fit, bust-flattering button placement | Price: $$$ Frank & Eileen launched in 2009 with the mission to \u201creinvent the button-up for women\u201d \u2014 since then, the company has earned a loyal following. The Eileen is its No. 1 best-selling shirt, cut from an Italian linen that\u2019s then made into a shirt in Mexico. Stylist Grace Thomas likes that the button-down is a combination of relaxed and elevated \u2014 even when wrinkled, the shirt has an air of \u201cI just threw this on\u201d to it without looking sloppy. \u201cIt hangs well on my body, always looks crisp, and makes me feel put-together so simply,\u201d says Thomas. She preaches about quality over quantity to clients, and says that Frank & Eileen\u2019s shirts are really the only button-down you\u2019ll need. (If you prefer something other than linen, the style is also available in denim, flannel, cotton, and voile, too.) My runner-up in this category is Aritzia\u2019s Wilfred button-down, which is made with a blend of linen and viscose, will run you only $88, and is a favorite of Sips By founder Staci Brinkman, who likes that it doesn\u2019t feel starchy or stiff in the slightest. $258 at Frank & Eileen Buy\n\nBest short-sleeved white button-down\n\nSaved View Want to be emailed when products you\u2019ve saved are over 20% off?

Cubavera Linen Short-Sleeved Button-Down Guayabera Shirt $69 now 26% off From $51 Sizes: XS\u20135X (men\u2019s) | Fabric: Linen | Design details: Camp collar, notched sleeves, pleating | Price: $$ I know this is a men\u2019s button-down, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with taking from menswear for your own closet. Guayaberas are famous in Caribbean fashion \u2014 my Dominican dad plans to wear them exclusively once he retires \u2014and are known for their distinctive pleating on the front and back. This one has those traditional lines and makes an excellent short-sleeved button-down for hot summer days or as a beach shirt. Coming of Age founder Amanda Lurie owns a collection of guayaberas that are new and old, almost always layering them over her bathing suits. Lurie suggests going down at least a size in this version, especially as the linen shirts are designed to be flowing.

Equipment Slim Signature Silk Shirt From $182 Sizes: XXS\u2013XXL | Fabric: Silk | Design details: Two chest pockets, point collar, button cuffs | Price: $$$ Equipment\u2019s silk shirts have become somewhat iconic \u2014 and this one counts stylist Jasmine Caccamo, Birdy Grey, and author Jen Doll as fans. Caccamo had been \u201cscouring every inch of the internet\u201d to find the perfect white button-down, and her search led her to this slimmer-cut silk option that hangs especially nicely across the bodice. That\u2019s a sentiment that Lee and Doll, who are both bigger-busted, share. \u201cI live in slouchy silk button-downs by Equipment,\u201d Lee says. It\u2019s neither too tailored nor too fitted on her, and she buttons it low enough for a hint of clavicle (and bra). Doll explains that the \u201cbuttons don\u2019t pull awkwardly across the chest,\u201d calling them a godsend. \u201cThere are pockets on each breast, but unlike other brands I\u2019ve worn (J.Crew, Uniqlo, Banana Republic), they don\u2019t look bulky or do strange things to the cleavage.\u201d Even though it\u2019s on the pricier side, our panelists buy it in multiples.
