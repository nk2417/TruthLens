Tristan is protective of my entire family, which is beautiful. And I love that everything we do is as a union. When he speaks, it\u2019s \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018we,\u2019 and that\u2019s important because it shows that you\u2019re sharing life.\u201d\n\nEvery Athlete & Rapper Khloe Kardashian Has Dated\n\nKardashian joked on the season 13 finale of KUWTK in June that her beau would like to have enough children to start his own basketball team. \u201cHe wants to have, like, five or six kids with me, and that\u2019s lovely,\u201d she said of the Cleveland Cavaliers center. \u201cWe could start at one and then grow from there. But now, knowing I\u2019m not on birth control, it\u2019s really scary. It\u2019s like a really big step.\u201d\n\nDespite her fears, the Good American designer has repeatedly stated through the years that she\u2019d like to start a family of her own. \u201cShe definitely wants a big family,\u201d a source exclusively told Us in April. \u201cShe wants multiple kids!\u201d\n\nRelated: The Cutest Kardashian Kids Moments Ever!

Meanwhile, Thompson shares a 9-month-old son, Prince, with his ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 isn\u2019t the only expectant member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan.
