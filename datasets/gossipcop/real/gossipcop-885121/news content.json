Bravo has released the first trailer for the Garden State franchise\u2019s eighth season, set to premiere in October, and while it features the return of OG Danielle Staub, this time Teresa Giudice is flipping furniture at resident troublemaker and Posche boutique owner Kim DePaola, aka Kim D.\n\n\u201cYou know what Posche stands for?\u201d Teresa screams at Kim D. before flipping a chair in her direction. \u201cPiece Of S\u2014 Coke-whore Home-wrecker Every Day.\u201d (Anyone still think reality television isn\u2019t scripted? Anyone?)\n\nTeresa is apparently furious at Kim D. for spreading rumors that Teresa\u2019s husband Joe stepped out on her while Teresa was serving her year-long stint in federal prison for bankruptcy fraud and conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud. And while Danielle\u2014back after a five-season absence as a \u201cfriend of the Housewives\u201d\u2014seems to have reconciled with Teresa over a shared love of yoga (and publicity), she clashes with Dolores Catania, and drinks are flung when she tangles with queen of kumbaya Siggy Flicker. Siggy also has a bone to pick with newcomer Margaret Josephs, a pig-tailed lifestyle expert.\n\nSeason 8 of The Real Housewives of New Jersey will also feature at least one over-the-top soir\u00e9e, a pizza war (Joe Gorga buys a strip-mall pizzeria unbeknownst to wife Melissa), a lavish trip to Italy, a tonnage of false eyelashes, Teresa screeching \u201cMilania!,\u201d Danielle showing off the, er, flexibility that earned her 19 marriage proposals, and a return of internecine tensions between Teresa and Melissa (\u201cShe\u2019s not a Gorga,\u201d Teresa tells Joe dismissively at one point. \u201cShe\u2019s only a Gorga by marriage.\u201d)\n\nIn quieter moments, Teresa and her family struggle with the death of her mother, Antonia Gorga, who passed away in March at the age of 66, and unresolved issues between Dolores and her ex-husband Frank seem to rise to the surface.\n\nRHONJ Season 8 returns Oct. 4 at 9/8c with a 75-minute premiere. And for those suffering from Jersey withdrawal (symptoms: wearing head-to-toe leopard print, a disconcerting craving for sausage), Bravo is also airing a special, The Real Housewives of New Jersey: How They Got Here, Tuesday, Aug. 22, at 9:30/8:30c.\n\nReal Housewives of New Jersey, Season 8 Premiere, Oct. 4, 9/8c, Bravo", "images": ["https://images.justwatch.com/icon/430993/s100/image.png",
