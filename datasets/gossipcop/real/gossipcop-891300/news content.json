A month after the business mogul and Real Housewives of New York City star traveled to Puerto Rico with four planes packed with supplies for Hurricane Maria relief efforts, she\u2019s planning a return trip.\n\nIn fact, Frankel reveals she will spend her 47th birthday on Saturday on her return trip to help with continued hurricane relief.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going this weekend for my birthday to Puerto Rico. I don\u2019t usually love my birthday. I think it\u2019s an interesting way to give back on your birthday and a good way to reflect on my age and where I am,\u201d she told E! News.\n\nThe Skinnygirl founder said she plans on returning to Puerto Rico \u201cmultiple times\u201d and will also pay a visit to the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nMore: Jennifer Lopez Donating $1 million to Puerto Rico Hurricane Recovery Effort\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sending a lot of relief to the U.S. Virgin Islands, particularly Dominica. They\u2019ve been destroyed,\u201d Frankel said. \u201cEach disaster is its own sort of baby that needs to be nurtured. People forget about one and then move on to the rest so Puerto Rico is definitely a priority but so is the U.S. Virgin Islands.\u201d\n\nDuring her first charity trip, Frankel\u2019s B Strong organization partnered with Delivering GOod, Feeding America and Global Empowerment Mission to raise $25,000 in Costco giftcards, $25,000 cash and 15,000 pounds of food, water and medical supplies for Hurricane Maria victims in Puerto Rico.\n\nFrankel says she and her team have raised somewhere between $5 and $10 million for disaster relief, and she doesn\u2019t plan on slowing down anytime soon.\n\n\u201cI will not finish that charitable job until they\u2019re getting their footing,\u201d she shared with us.\n\nLast week, it was revealed that hundreds of Puerto Ricans have died since the hurricane, but their deaths were all attributed to \u201cnatural causes.\u201d\n\nSpokesperson for Puerto Rico\u2019s Department of Public Safety, Karixia Ortiz Serrano, said that the 911 reported deaths after Hurricane Maria were not related to the hurricane, but BuzzFeed reports that none of the bodies were \u201cexamined by a medical examiner for consideration to be included in the Maria death toll.\u201d\n\nSerrano stated that the classifications of death by \u201cnatural causes\u201d were made by reviewing records and not inspection by medical examiners. She went on to share that the Puerto Rican government has \u201cno official guidelines on what qualifies as a hurricane-related death.\u201d\n\nWith the official hurricane-related death toll at 51 in Puerto Rico, more than 900 bodies were cremated before medical examiners got a chance to look at them.\n\nPhoto Credit: Instagram / @bethennyfrankel", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/zach-bryan.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": [".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/news/bethenny-frankel-birthday-puerto-rico-hurricane-marie-relief/", "title": "Bethenny Frankel Will Spend Her Birthday Helping With Hurricane Relief in Puerto Rico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bethenny Frankel Will Spend Her Birthday Helping With Hurricane Relief in Puerto Rico", "description": "Bethenny Frankel\u2019s hurricane relief mission is far from over.
