The extra time will give filmmakers the opportunity to work out the logistics of presenting flight sequences with new technology and planes. The sequel will be set in a world of drone technology and will explore the end of the era of dogfighting, with Cruise portraying a flight instructor. In May, Cruise posted a photo of himself in front of what appeared to be a Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet.\n\n\u201cOblivion\u201d helmer Joe Kosinski is directing the film, a sequel to 1986\u2019s \u201cTop Gun,\u201d from a script by Peter Craig, Justin Marks, and Eric Warren Singer. Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the first movie with the late Don Simpson, will produce with Cruise and Skydance CEO David Ellison.\n\n\u201cOnly the Brave\u201d star Miles Teller will play Goose\u2019s son and Maverick\u2019s new protege. Goose, the co-pilot to Cruise\u2019s character in the original, was played by Anthony Edwards.\n\nVal Kilmer will reprise his role as Tom \u201cIceman\u201d Kazansky in the sequel. Jon Hamm, Ed Harris, Lewis Pullman, Charles Parnell, Jay Ellis, Bashir Salahuddin, Danny Ramirez, and Monica Barbaro round out the cast.\n\nThe original film was a massive success, grossing more than $350 million worldwide on a $15 million budget.\n\nParamount also announced on Wednesday that it has dated its sequel to the horror pic \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d for May 15, 2020. The sleeper hit, starring John Krasinski and Emily Blunt, has hauled $188 million domestically and $144 million internationally.\n\nKrasinski directed the story of an isolated family of four that must live in silence while hiding from creatures that hunt by sound. He\u2019s working on the script for the sequel.\n\nRELATED VIDEO:", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/rexfeatures_5886113be.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/rexfeatures_5886113be.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Mcnary", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/tom-cruise-top-gun-sequel-maverick-delayed-1202920891/", "title": "Tom Cruise\u2019s \u2018Top Gun: Maverick\u2019 Pushed Back to 2020, \u2018A Quiet Place\u2019 Sequel Dated", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Tom Cruise's \"Top Gun\" sequel, \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" has been pushed back nearly a year from July 12, 2019, to June 26, 2020.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Dave McNary", "tags": "Tom Cruise, Top Gun, Top Gun: Maverick", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Tom Cruise\u2019s \u2018Top Gun: Maverick\u2019 Pushed Back to 2020, \u2018A Quiet Place\u2019 Sequel Dated", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/tom-cruise-top-gun-sequel-maverick-delayed-1202920891/", "description": "Tom Cruise's \"Top Gun\" sequel, \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" has been pushed back nearly a year from July 12, 2019, to June 26, 2020.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/rexfeatures_5886113be.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "No Merchandising.
