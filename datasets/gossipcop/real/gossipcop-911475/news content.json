(As Bennett\u2019s character notes, it\u2019s pretty much the same sketch as before\u2014with more current references.) Black Swan, Portman\u2019s kids, and her ballerino husband all get a shout-out in this updated sketch. The sequel may not be quite as successful as the first attempt (mostly because it lacks the element of surprise), but a Samberg cameo is always welcome.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68ff9a93b697272970dd743c/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698159454492f4f8bbea9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/nat-rap.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69175c8668855851e1fe1fab/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54205e6d1019a3955fea2c28/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691cd91f9f3eb60315ac3531/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fa73de018822eab33ea7c5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690944318b75c927a793b8d6/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691c8b089c65b610ab31a7f4/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698ac36333c17dc84d68c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/nat-rap.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690a599bec5ef29213749151/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54205e6d1019a3955fea2c2c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6904b792447a00332ceb4fd3/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6903c0265ea86fe0396d3ff4/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690a5ee0da787343f1849201/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54205e6d1019a3955fea2c29/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6919bbed01714426f5a0dc01/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690ce036e4de48864a6dff15/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698ac36333c17dc84d68c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/nat-rap.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joanna Robinson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/snl-natalie-portman-rap-video-star-wars-prequels-andy-samberg", "title": "S.N.L.: Watch Natalie Portman Rap About Star Wars Prequels as Andy Samberg Returns", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Joanna Robinson", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Wow, who knew Jar Jar Binks was packing so much heat?", "id": "5a76970c51dfe02fe324c1f8", "keywords": "natalie portman,andy samberg,jar jar binks,beck bennett,star wars prequel", "news_keywords": "natalie portman,andy samberg,jar jar binks,beck bennett,star wars prequel", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a76970c51dfe02fe324c1f8", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Wow, who knew Jar Jar Binks was packing so much heat?\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698ac36333c17dc84d68c/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/nat-rap.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698ac36333c17dc84d68c/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/nat-rap.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Wow, who knew Jar Jar Binks was packing so much heat?", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698ac36333c17dc84d68c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/nat-rap.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "S.N.L.: Watch Natalie Portman Rap About Star Wars Prequels as Andy Samberg Returns", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/02/snl-natalie-portman-rap-video-star-wars-prequels-andy-samberg"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-02-04T05:36:10.841Z", "modified_time": "2018-02-04T05:36:10.841Z", "author": "Joanna Robinson"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Wow, who knew Jar Jar Binks was packing so much heat?", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698ac36333c17dc84d68c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/nat-rap.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "S.N.L.: Watch Natalie Portman Rap About Star Wars Prequels as Andy Samberg Returns"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7698ac36333c17dc84d68c/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/nat-rap.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google": "nopagereadaloud", "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517722570.841, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
