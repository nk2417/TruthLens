Blunt kicked things off at the ball by singing Houston\u2019s \u201cI Wanna Dance with Somebody,\u201d which inspired Corden to respond with Mars\u2019 \u201cJust The Way You Are.\u201d\n\nThey were, of course, quickly living a \u201cTeenage Dream,\u201d with Blunt crooning Adele\u2019s \u201cHello\u201d from her balcony and Corden responding with Lionel Richie\u2019s yearning song of the same name as the Capulets and Montague\u2019s got to battling to Carl Douglas\u2019 iconic \u201cKung-Fu Fighting.\u201d\n\nThe endless lovers wondered \u201cWhat\u2019s Your Fantasy\u201d and then complained their families were being \u201cRude,\u201d leading Blunt to take something \u201cToxic.\u201d And well, you know how it ends, but not typically with Carl Carlton\u2019s 1974 disco soul classic \u201cEverlasting Love.\u201d\n\nCheck it out:", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Soundtrack-to-Romeo-and-Juliet-Emily-Blunt-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=628&crop=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Soundtrack-to-Romeo-and-Juliet-Emily-Blunt-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Soundtrack-to-Romeo-and-Juliet-Emily-Blunt-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gil Kaufman", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/late-late-show-emily-blunt-james-corden-romeo-and-juliet-musical-7825612/", "title": "Emily Blunt & James Corden\u2019s Musical Tribute to \u2018Romeo and Juliet\u2019 Features Bruno Mars, Katy Perry, Adele & More: Watch", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The &quot;Into the Woods&quot; reunion also featured songs from Mariah Carey, MAGIC! and Ludacris.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Gil Kaufman", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Emily Blunt & James Corden\u2019s Musical Tribute to \u2018Romeo and Juliet\u2019 Features Bruno Mars, Katy Perry, Adele & More: Watch", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/late-late-show-emily-blunt-james-corden-romeo-and-juliet-musical-7825612/", "description": "The \"Into the Woods\" reunion also featured songs from Mariah Carey, MAGIC! and Ludacris.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Soundtrack-to-Romeo-and-Juliet-Emily-Blunt-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "James Corden and Emily Blunt perform Rom Com the Musical on \"The Late Late Show with James Corden,\" airing June 8, 2017 from London."}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-09T12:10:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-09-21T13:10:20+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"Into the Woods\" reunion also featured songs from Mariah Carey, MAGIC! and Ludacris.", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Emily Blunt & James Corden\u2019s Musical Tribute to \u2018Romeo and Juliet\u2019 Features Bruno Mars, Katy Perry, Adele & More: Watch", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Soundtrack-to-Romeo-and-Juliet-Emily-Blunt-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497010240.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
