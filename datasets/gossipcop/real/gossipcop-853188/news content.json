Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan, Little Big Town, Vince Gill, and Lady Antebellum have all taken the ice during the Predators home games in the first two rounds.\n\nAs the Predators hosted their first Western Conference Final game in franchise history, they also hosted a very special anthem singer.\n\nVideo\n\nKeith Urban, a native Australian and four-time Grammy Award winner, performed the Star-Spangled Banner for the first time in his career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lived in America for 25 years. I\u2019ve never been asked to sing the National Anthem, so it\u2019s such an honor to do it here in Nashville for the Preds,\u201d Urban said to NHL Network\u2019s Jon Morosi after his performance.\n\nUrban also spoke about how much the moment meant to him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a nerve-wracking experience, but above all, it\u2019s a huge honor,\u201d Urban said. \u201cFor me, for all the years I\u2019ve lived here, it\u2019s probably one of the proudest moments ever in my life.\u201d\n\nUrban, who is married to Nicole Kidman, said while he is a fan of the Predators, his wife is definitely the biggest fan in their household.\n\nWhile the Predators\u2019 new country pregame routine has been almost universally praised, the team encountered some controversy earlier this week. Dennis K. Morgan, who has performed the anthem for the Predators 185 times since 2000, criticized the organization through a local paper Tuesday.\n\nMorgan told the Tennessean\u2019s Mike Organ that the issues began after the \u201ccaptain\u2019s wife,\u201d Carrie Underwood, asked to sing the anthem during round one.\n\n\u201cIt was presented to me as a one night only kind of thing and I agreed to it,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cThen they continued to bring in these other singers and touted them as \u2018A-listers,\u2019 which kind of hurt me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t blame Carrie Underwood or Luke Bryan or any of the other acts who have performed. I\u2019ve been as good-natured as I can be,\u201d Morgan continued. \u201cWith my closest friends, I\u2019ve certainly shared my disappointment. But most of the time I\u2019ll toe the company line and say, \u2018Why am I not singing? Because I don\u2019t have seven Grammys, I\u2019m not married to the captain, she\u2019s a whole lot prettier than me,\u2019 that kind of thing and try to leave it at that.\u201d\n\nMorgan said that the Predators understood his disappointment, and have also apparently been hearing the same thing from some fans in attendance. Morgan was looking forward to hitting the 25-year mark of performing the anthem for NHL teams (which he would achieve during the 2018-19 season), but will now spend his summer doing some \u201csoul-searching.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/russianmachineneverbreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rmnb-puck-secondary-logo.png?fit=384%2C384&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/russianmachineneverbreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keith-urban-sings-national-anthem.jpg?fit=960%2C480&ssl=1&original", "https://i0.wp.com/russianmachineneverbreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/file-filip-forsberg-predators-aland-2373.jpg?fit=600%2C400&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/russianmachineneverbreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/file-roman-josa-predators-aland-2576.jpg?fit=600%2C400&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/russianmachineneverbreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keith-urban-sings-national-anthem.jpg?fit=960%2C480&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/russianmachineneverbreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/file-jakub-vrana-aland-0286.jpg?fit=600%2C400&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/russianmachineneverbreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/rmnb-main-logo-bubble-border.png?fit=2000%2C1084&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/russianmachineneverbreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keith-urban-sings-national-anthem.jpg?fit=960%2C480&ssl=1&original", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cara Bahniuk", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://russianmachineneverbreaks.com/2017/05/17/australian-keith-urban-performs-national-anthem-for-first-time-at-predators-game/", "title": "Australian Keith Urban performs national anthem for first time at Predators game", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no, minimum-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "author": "Cara Bahniuk", "article": {"author": "Cara Bahniuk", "published_time": "2017-05-17T14:18:13-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-05-17T14:18:13-04:00", "updated_time": "2017-05-17T14:18:13-04:00", "section": "News", "tag": "Nashville Predators"}, "og": {"description": "The Nashville Predators have embraced their country roots throughout the 2017 playoffs, inviting famous musicians to sing the national anthem before every\u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/russianmachineneverbreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keith-urban-sings-national-anthem.jpg?fit=960%2C480&ssl=1&original", "height": 480, "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 960}, "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "RMNB", "title": "Australian Keith Urban performs national anthem for first time at Predators game", "type": "article", "url": "https://russianmachineneverbreaks.com/2017/05/17/australian-keith-urban-performs-national-anthem-for-first-time-at-predators-game/"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@rmnb", "description": "The Nashville Predators have embraced their country roots throughout the 2017 playoffs, inviting famous musicians to sing the national anthem before every\u2026", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/russianmachineneverbreaks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/keith-urban-sings-national-anthem.jpg?fit=960%2C480&ssl=1&original", "site": "RMNB", "text": {"title": "Australian Keith Urban performs national anthem for first time at Predators game"}}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "RMNB - The relentlessly fun hockey site, hopelessly devoted to the Washington Capitals and Alex Ovechkin.
