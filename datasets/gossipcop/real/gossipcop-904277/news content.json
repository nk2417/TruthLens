At one point, the auctioneer yelled out \u201cIs the King of the North here?!\u201d But as it turned out, Harington had stepped out of the gala to go to the restroom.\n\nMeanwhile, Pitt bid $80,000 to watch an episode of \u201cGOT\u201d with Clarke. Then he outbid himself to $90,000. When Harington came back into the room, the actor offered to also sit in on the episode viewing. And that\u2019s when Pitt raised his own bid to $120,000.\n\nIn the end, Pitt was outbid by a gala-goer who ended the auction at $160,000.\n\nThe charity event to benefit the J/P HRO & Disaster Relief Organizations was hosted by Penn, CAA\u2019s Bryan Lourd and Sean and Alexandra Parker. Also in attendance were Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos Lena Dunham, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Segel, Connie Britton, Patricia Arquette, Mark Burnett, Roma Downey and Leonardo DiCaprio, who was honored for his work combating climate change.\n\n\u201cThe biggest challenge now is to make sure that everyone understands what\u2019s at stake,\u201d DiCaprio said of the dangers of climate change during his speech onstage at the gala. Referring to President Donald Trump, DiCaprio continued, \u201cBut how can we do this when we have a president who, just this week, proposed a massive increase in offshore drilling?\u201d Garnering laughter from the room, DiCaprio quipped, \u201cTheir denial of so much of the scientific proof and evidence belongs in \u2018the Earth is flat\u2019 chapter of human history.\u201d\n\nDuring his speech, DiCaprio applauded Penn for being a role model with his philanthropic work with Haiti. By the midway point of the gala, more than $3 million had been raised to support the efforts in Haiti, though the fundraising continued throughout the night toward what will amount to a larger number in the millions.\n\n\u201cThese are obviously incredibly turbulent and scary times,\u201d DiCaprio said during his speech. \u201cNever doubt that a small group of thoughtful citizens can change the world. Indeed, it\u2019s the only thing that has.\u201d\n\nLater during the auction, DiCaprio bid $80,000 on a painting by artist Josh Smith, but was outbid by Clarke herself for $90,000 \u2014 but, there was a second Smith painting available, so in the end, both DiCaprio and Clarke ended up walking away with artwork.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rexfeatures_9308863ai.jpg", "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rexfeatures_9308863as.jpg", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brad-pitt-auction.jpg?w=1000&h=667&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brad-pitt-auction.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/brad-pitt-auction.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elizabeth Wagmeister", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/scene/news/brad-pitt-bid-120000-to-watch-game-of-thrones-with-emilia-clarke-1202655715/", "title": "Brad Pitt Bid $120,000 to Watch \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 With Emilia Clarke", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Winter is officially here for Brad Pitt.
