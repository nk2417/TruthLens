It changes your outlook on life.\n\n\u201cEven on a plane. I'm never scared of flying - and as soon as there was any turbulence I was like 'oh my God', because there's more than my life I have to care about now.\n\n\u201cIt made me feel a bit more nervous. It changes your perspective on absolutely everything.\n\n\u201cIt's all filled with excitement, getting everything ready, feeling like you don't really know what's going to happen.\n\n\u201cThe fear of what might happen and the excitement. There's so many emotions that come with being an expectant father.\u201d\n\nDaley and Black also announced their engagement in a similarly understated way in 2015, with an announcement reading: \u201cThe engagement is announced between Tom, the son of Robert and Debra Daley of Plymouth, and Lance, son of Jeff Bisch of Philadelphia and Anne Bisch of Lake Providence.\u201d\n\nBlack, 44, is an American film director and producer. He won an Oscar for best original screenplay for Milk, a film based on the life of gay rights activist and politician Harvey Milk.\n\nAdditional reporting by Press Association.", "images": ["https://www.independent.co.uk/img/logo-white-out.svg", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/14/14/tom-daley-dustin-lance-black.jpg", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/14/14/tom-daley-dustin-lance-black.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/14/14/tom-daley-dustin-lance-black.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/tom-daley-father-dustin-lance-black-husband-baby-birth-lgbt-surrogate-robert-ray-a8424351.html", "title": "Tom Daley and husband Dustin Lance Black release first photos of their baby boy", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "People", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/news/people", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "Couple\u00a0revealed they were expecting\u00a0child through\u00a0surrogate", "og": {"updated_time": "2018-06-30T14:05:00.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Tom Daley and husband Dustin Lance Black release first photos of their baby boy", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/tom-daley-father-dustin-lance-black-husband-baby-birth-lgbt-surrogate-robert-ray-a8424351.html", "type": "article", "description": "Couple\u00a0revealed they were expecting\u00a0child through\u00a0surrogate", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/14/14/tom-daley-dustin-lance-black.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/14/14/tom-daley-dustin-lance-black.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-30T14:05:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-06-30T14:05:00.000Z", "section": "News", "subsection": "People", "author_name": "Tom Embury-Dennis", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 473, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 3, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 2, "external_link_count": 2}, "date": "2018-06-30T14:05:00.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Tom Daley and husband Dustin Lance Black release first photos of their baby boy", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Couple\u00a0revealed they were expecting\u00a0child through\u00a0surrogate", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/14/14/tom-daley-dustin-lance-black.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Tom Daley\",\"Dustin Lance Black\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530367500.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
