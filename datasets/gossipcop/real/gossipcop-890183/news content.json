Spacey, who claimed not to remember the incident, said that if he did do what Rapp has alleged, then he owes him the \u201csincerest apology\u201d for his \u201cinappropriate\u201d behavior. Rapp described Spacey climbing on top of him on a bed at a party in 1986 before he was ultimately able to get away and leave the room. Spacey also took the opportunity to address the rumors about his sexuality, revealing for the first time publicly that he \u201cchooses\u201d to \u201clive as a gay man.\u201d In a 2010 interview with The Daily Beast, Spacey declined to specify his sexual orientation, saying, \u201cNo one\u2019s personal life is in the public interest. It\u2019s gossip, bottom line.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/fb.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/email-icon.svg?d=342", "https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/1741381130319.png", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/images/obsessed-header-logo-h-2.png?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/7L6PYMCE7RHEBIJZKR23DVTIJI.jpg?smart=true&auth=2558e4fc878237f3ad5bb1aa41ed598bebc770410fe3c21b06f961d190dd7689&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/EWN2HO23WFHEPEOB535VFSJESE.jpg?smart=true&auth=5473a7540fbf3f803d5a3b62c7ad7c92b410d0960478a72bc6a3cafa11790f0a&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/6PURTJTDWVKSTPQVFNWPHN5VCU.jpg?smart=true&auth=cfe47c58f95714940e1759500112224b724458b97531d1c2a43fdbad40773bbb&width=1200&height=630", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/6PURTJTDWVKSTPQVFNWPHN5VCU.jpg?smart=true&auth=cfe47c58f95714940e1759500112224b724458b97531d1c2a43fdbad40773bbb&width=1600&height=900", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/google_play.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/twitter-icon.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/reddit.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/Q6VCSZVA2RAGNOY6RHL3JBDX7U.jpg?smart=true&auth=696d13f7ff11f29130823ec818b6cf4c2a2514821a3fc754adf0dd8b4025ae04&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/CA3SBAC7NJGJJI5ZH4T2BOXSSY.jpg?smart=true&auth=febb80c37d6c8f85521f97ca93fe56543f7fa790476febc828f4e461ce8e5882&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/app_store.svg?d=342", "https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/thedailybeast/XFTXRFJXFRPDVAAWAK77NIJGKY.jpg", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/SDEZH4IJYVANHG7SB7OHOLN25Y.png?smart=true&auth=f6c5d3a487876ce737293fc82e0d933b093632d4a0460243076f5ddaaedf4e9a&width=1440&height=1080"], "top_img": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/6PURTJTDWVKSTPQVFNWPHN5VCU.jpg?smart=true&auth=cfe47c58f95714940e1759500112224b724458b97531d1c2a43fdbad40773bbb&width=1200&height=630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Editor", "Matt.Wilstein Thedailybeast.Com", "Got A Tip", "Send It To The Daily Beast", "Farrah Tomazin", "Cameron Adams", "Julia Ornedo", "Catherine Bouris"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/kevin-spacey-comes-out-as-gay-apologizes-to-anthony-rapp/", "title": "Kevin Spacey Addresses Misconduct Allegation by Coming Out as Gay", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Actor responds to allegations that he made a pass at 14-year-old boy.", "twitter": {"description": "Actor responds to allegations that he made a pass at 14-year-old boy.", "title": "Spacey Addresses Misconduct Allegation by Coming Out as Gay", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/6PURTJTDWVKSTPQVFNWPHN5VCU.jpg?smart=true&auth=cfe47c58f95714940e1759500112224b724458b97531d1c2a43fdbad40773bbb&width=1200&height=630", "alt": "RTR3FYGC_hs8qno"}, "site": "@https://twitter.com/thedailybeast", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"description": "Actor responds to allegations that he made a pass at 14-year-old boy.", "title": "Spacey Addresses Misconduct Allegation by Coming Out as Gay", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/6PURTJTDWVKSTPQVFNWPHN5VCU.jpg?smart=true&auth=cfe47c58f95714940e1759500112224b724458b97531d1c2a43fdbad40773bbb&width=1200&height=630", "alt": "RTR3FYGC_hs8qno"}, "type": "article", "site_name": "The Daily Beast", "url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/kevin-spacey-comes-out-as-gay-apologizes-to-anthony-rapp/"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "loadforge-site-verification": "3ac1d76b00b152231dc1bef253b8d571e663ffa9b4826b38646ee6d4a23225d2a762aac1254120868ebecd9c4666ad563ef03b99a25d3966cba08ee2380aa43b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.thedailybeast.com", "summary": ""}
