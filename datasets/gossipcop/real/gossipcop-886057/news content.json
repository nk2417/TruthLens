According to a 2015 memo by a former Weinstein Company executive that The Times previously disclosed, the misconduct continued.\n\nMore established actresses were fearful of speaking out because they had work; less established ones were scared because they did not. \u201cThis is Harvey Weinstein,\u201d Katherine Kendall, who appeared in the film \u201cSwingers\u201d and television roles, remembers telling herself after an encounter in which she said Mr. Weinstein undressed and chased her around a living room. Telling others meant \u201cI\u2019ll never work again and no one is going to care or believe me,\u201d she reasoned at the time, she said in a recent interview.\n\nMs. Paltrow, 45, is now an entrepreneur, no longer dependent on securing her next acting role. But she emphasized how much more vulnerable she felt at 22, when Mr. Weinstein had just signed her up for a star-making part. On a trip to Los Angeles, she received a schedule from her agents for the hotel meeting with Mr. Weinstein.\n\nThere was no reason to suspect anything untoward, because \u201cit\u2019s on the fax, it\u2019s from C.A.A.,\u201d she said, referring to Creative Artists Agency, which represented her.\n\nWhen Mr. Weinstein tried to massage her and invited her into the bedroom, she immediately left, she said, and remembers feeling stunned as she drove away. \u201cI thought you were my Uncle Harvey,\u201d she recalled thinking, explaining that she had seen him as a mentor.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/us/10actress-alpha/10actress-alpha-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2017&h=700&w=1050&s=aaa40c15fa316ce4c22178c05d78b78e31d739922d0b36721e724f259e7f58fe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/11/us/00Actresses1/00Actresses1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/11/us/00Actresses4/00Actresses4-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/us/10actress-alpha/10actress-alpha-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2017&h=700&w=1050&s=aaa40c15fa316ce4c22178c05d78b78e31d739922d0b36721e724f259e7f58fe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jodi Kantor", "Rachel Abrams"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Others Say Weinstein Harassed Them", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "\u201cThis way of treating women ends now,\u201d Ms. Paltrow said as she and other actresses accused the producer of casting-couch abuses.", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Others Say Weinstein Harassed Them (Published 2017)", "description": "\u201cThis way of treating women ends now,\u201d Ms. Paltrow said as she and other actresses accused the producer of casting-couch abuses.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/us/10actress-alpha/10actress-alpha-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v10.jpg?year=2017&h=900&w=1600&s=ec4882dbcdb8e4e08a0fce2ff69e0f8844bff4f1d1945f420113ff3c4f9cbb24&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/bfb87e8e-14e4-5cef-96b1-ad6966944c78"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html", "type": "article", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Others Say Weinstein Harassed Them (Published 2017)", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/us/10actress-alpha/10actress-alpha-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2017&h=700&w=1050&s=aaa40c15fa316ce4c22178c05d78b78e31d739922d0b36721e724f259e7f58fe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "description": "\u201cThis way of treating women ends now,\u201d Ms. Paltrow said as she and other actresses accused the producer of casting-couch abuses."}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-10T17:02:43.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-12T17:48:03.000Z", "section": "U.S.", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/rachel-abrams", "tag": "Dunning, Dawn", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 100000005486212, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/bfb87e8e-14e4-5cef-96b1-ad6966944c78", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/5fc71d23e2364f0ea8579c91bba48562", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/us/10actress-alpha/10actress-alpha-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2017&h=700&w=1050&s=aaa40c15fa316ce4c22178c05d78b78e31d739922d0b36721e724f259e7f58fe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "byl": "By Jodi Kantor and Rachel Abrams", "news_keywords": "Harvey Weinstein,Sexual harassment,Movies,Actor,Gwyneth Paltrow,Angelina Jolie,Tomi-Ann Roberts,Rosanna Arquette,Katherine Kendall,Judith Godr\u00e8che,Dawn Dunning", "pdate": 20171010, "CG": "us", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/bfb87e8e-14e4-5cef-96b1-ad6966944c78", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507608000.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
