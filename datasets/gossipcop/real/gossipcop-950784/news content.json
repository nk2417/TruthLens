He came to Vox in 2014. Prior to that, he worked at The Atlantic.\n\nThe 2018 Emmy Awards have arrived. The 70th annual Primetime Emmy Awards will air on Monday, September 17, honoring the greatest television achievements of the past year.\n\nThe major awards are divided into separate categories for comedy and drama. On the drama side, the 2018 nominations include 20 nods for 2017\u2019s big winner, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. As a freshman series, the grim, dystopian adaptation of Margaret Atwood\u2019s novel took home several awards, including Outstanding Writing in a Drama Series and Outstanding Drama Series. Additionally, the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series prize went to series star Elisabeth Moss, who won an Emmy for the first time after seven prior nominations.\n\nIn 2018, The Handmaid\u2019s Tale is once again in the running for Outstanding Drama Series, alongside the 2016 winner, Game of Thrones, as well as Westworld, The Crown, This Is Us, Stranger Things, and The Americans.\n\nOverall, the most nominated dramas are Game of Thrones and Westworld, which have 22 and 21 nominations, respectively, when the awards\u2019 technical categories are considered. Game of Thrones is newly returned to the Emmys race: After winning Outstanding Drama Series in 2016, the HBO powerhouse drama was not eligible for the 2017 Emmys because its seventh season didn\u2019t air within the eligibility period.\n\nAnd while the acclaimed new series Killing Eve was overlooked in several categories, its star Sandra Oh (beloved as Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019s Cristina Yang) has made history as the first woman of Asian descent to be nominated for a Lead Actress Emmy.\n\nOn the comedy side, the nominations field is especially crowded, with eight series vying for the main prize. For the first time in years, the reigning champ Veep is missing, since the show\u2019s final season was delayed while its star Julia Louis-Dreyfus underwent treatment for cancer.\n\nAmong the contenders for the Outstanding Comedy Series throne are the Golden Globe-winning The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, a newcomer to the Emmys, and the second season of Donald Glover\u2019s Atlanta. The first season of Atlanta was nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series honors last year; while it lost the crown to Veep, Glover (who created and stars in the series) won the Emmy for Lead Actor in a Comedy Series.\n\nThis year, Atlanta earned repeat nominations in both categories, as well as three other nods in acting categories. The rest of the Outstanding Comedy Series nominees are HBO\u2019s buzzy upstart Barry, the Netflix wrestling comedy GLOW, Silicon Valley, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Black-ish, and Curb Your Enthusiasm.\n\nNBC will broadcast the 2018 Emmy Awards show live on Monday. Saturday Night Live\u2019s Colin Jost and Michael Che will host the ceremony.\n\nHere are the nominees in all the awards\u2019 major categories.
