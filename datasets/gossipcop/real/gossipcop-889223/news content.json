That\u2019s why we knew we had to ask the singer\u2014currently in the midst of working on her seventh studio album\u2014to break down five of her most iconic moves, so that you can know exactly which one to bust out the next time you need to make waves on the dance floor. (Especially since she was already so kind as to show us her day-to-night beauty routine.)\n\nOn an afternoon in Brooklyn\u2019s Grand Prospect Hall, a day before performing with Bruno Mars in New Jersey, Ciara let loose to her latest single, \u201cDose\u201d (the video dropped on October 25). In her music video, Ciara hosts the world\u2019s coolest pep rally, leading a dance team in a high school gym in front of a marching band. The same moves can be found here: Round da Way, Woah, Get Up, the beloved 1, 2 (of \u201c1, 2 Step\u201d), and Bucking, made famous in the \u201cRide\u201d video. Ciara\u2019s longtime choreographer, Jamaica Craft, was on set, as were several very chic ensembles, including a Marc Jacobs bodysuit and a pair of incredible Ann Demeulemeester boots (not a leotard in site in Vogue\u2019s 5 Moves series).", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/690282d005bc34170a7bf99b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6905005a66c1c16263e7c92f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/69095f6ef26d05febe0b92f9/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68fbbb7df0d75544d6fbbb1f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68fedf480008936a1a221145/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bd5d695011ea52d39268893/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ciara_h.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6499ef4f353472860bc0b7c3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/690953df7cb70616c5d9b941/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68ff886339d54ce1d4b32e05/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/691753ce9a7ed3279de6a4f4/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/us/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6908cb983a9d203258f98379/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/690950ddac92a58d3fef5d17/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/69046ecfff0e2f8935126a69/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bd5d695011ea52d39268893/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ciara_h.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/ciara-dose-iconic-dance-moves-video", "title": "Watch Ciara Break Down 5 Iconic Dance Moves to Her New Single, \u201cDose\u201d", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Vogue", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Ciara breaks down five of her favorite dance moves to her new single, \u201cDose,\u201d for Vogue\u2019s 5 Moves series.", "id": "5bd3704af0bbca2d81c96ba4", "keywords": "ciara", "news_keywords": "ciara", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=289380413, app-argument=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id289380413?pt=45076&ct=VOG_Smart_Banner&mt=8", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5bd3704af0bbca2d81c96ba4", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Ciara breaks down five of her favorite dance moves to her new single, \u201cDose,\u201d for Vogue\u2019s 5 Moves series.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bd5d682011ea52d39268891/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/ciara_h.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bd5d682011ea52d39268891/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/ciara_h.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "To her new single, \u201cDose.\u201d", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bd5d695011ea52d39268893/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ciara_h.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Watch Ciara Break Down 5 Iconic Dance Moves", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/ciara-dose-iconic-dance-moves-video"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-10-29T14:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-10-29T14:00:00.000Z", "author": "Vogue"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "To her new single, \u201cDose.\u201d", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bd5d695011ea52d39268893/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ciara_h.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Watch Ciara Break Down 5 Iconic Dance Moves"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bd5d695011ea52d39268893/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/ciara_h.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1540821600.0, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
