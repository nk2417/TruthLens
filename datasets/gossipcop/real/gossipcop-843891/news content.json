We had fallen madly in love and it was the first time I had ever been in love.\u201d\n\nThe pair decided to elope before Hunnam, then 18, had to head back home to England. \u201cWe thought, \u2018What if we never see each other again? Let\u2019s get married and then we\u2019ll have to see each other again even if it\u2019s just to get divorced,\u2019\u201d he recalled. \u201cSo we came to Vegas, but I couldn\u2019t even get a drink so I actually didn\u2019t think I would be able to get married.\u201d\n\nBut anything goes in Sin City. At 2 A.M., Hunnam and Towne said \u201cI do\u201d in front of Silver Bell Wedding Chapel\u2019s Reverend RJ Cotton. (They wanted to get married by Elvis but \u201che left the building,\u201d joked Hunnam.)\n\nRelated: Celebrity Couples and How They First Met: Love Story Beginnings Star-crossed lovers!

I also try to make love as often as I can. That\u2019s an important part of fitness. There\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t be active at 70. I want to run up mountains at that age,\u201d Hunnam told Men\u2019s Health. \u201cWe are supposed to be very active animals. It\u2019s our DNA. Sweating is how I change my oil every day. I just feel happier, more positive, energized, and disciplined if I work out.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
