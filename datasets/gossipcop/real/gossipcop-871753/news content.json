Earlier, Miley Cyrus shared a sweet Instagram message with her main man Liam Hemsworth from the comfort of her bed. The \u201cWe can\u2019t stop\u201d singer posted the three images on social media, which featured the sleepy star cuddling with their labradoodle pup Dora, who was named after the Nickelodeon show.\n\nAlong with the too-cute images, the 24-year-old wrote, \u201cWe miss you @liamhemsworth!\u201d\n\nAn hour before Miley Cyrus penned her affectionate post, Liam Hemsworth hopped on Instagram and shared an image of himself and the pup with the caption, \u201c#thuglife.\u201d Cyrus commented, \u201cLucky to have you babies to cuddle\u201d and then posted her message back to her long-term love.\n\nBack in 2015, Cyrus helped the Aussie actor adopt Dora from Wylder\u2019s Holistic Pet Centre & Rescue in LA\u2019s Studio City neighbourhood. The two took to social media during the outing and their posts ignited rumours that the two had rekindled their broken romance, which turned out to be true.\n\nSince reconciling after their famous split in 2013, the two stars, who try to keep their high-profile romance under the radar, have been going strong. The pair got engaged again in early 2016 but have yet to walk down the aisle.\n\nEarlier this year, Cyrus told Billboard that their broken engagement four years earlier was for the best because it made them a better pairing now.\n\n\u201cI needed to change so much. And changing with someone else not changing like that is too hard,\u201d she says. \u201cSuddenly you\u2019re like, \u2018I don\u2019t recognise you anymore\u2019. We had to re-fall for each other.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019d miss Hemsworth too if we were Cyrus!\n\nPublished in Daily Times, August 10th 2017.", "images": ["https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/11/20/1530212_1326188_GAZA-NEW-2_updates-convert.io_.jpg", "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/11/20/918968_85984879.jpg", "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/11/20/20172803ea62898-convert.io_.jpg", "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/11/20/909701_23013628.jpg", "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/11/20/pak-indonesia-flag-1024-1.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/11/20/1530207_5798063_GAZA-NEW-2_updates-convert.io_.jpg", "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/11/20/PPFP3DTF65IGLJIHHCC4OIJP6A.jpg", "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/07/app-icon-192x192-1-192x180-1.png", "https://dailytimes.com.pk/static/uploads/original/4ad45cf88743efcdc88e84c6c17f4e1c.jpg", "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/11/20/WhatsApp-Image-2025-11-20-at-3.41.34-PM_11zon.jpeg", "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/11/20/article-images-hina-amp-shahmeer-11761221265-0-640x480-convert.io_.jpg", "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/11/20/dubai-air-show-latest-convert.io_.jpg", "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/11/20/pakistan-saudi-arabia-oil_11zon.jpeg", "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/11/20/201476132635971734_20_11zon.jpeg", "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/11/20/919030_56654752.jpg"], "top_img": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/assets/uploads/2025/07/app-icon-192x192-1-192x180-1.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://dailytimes.com.pk/121457/miley-pens-sweet-message-to-liam-hemsworth-and-their-dog-dora/", "title": "Miley pens sweet message to Liam Hemsworth and their dog Dora", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Miley pens sweet message to Liam Hemsworth and their dog Dora - Daily Times", "description": "Talk about a cozy lazy Sunday!
