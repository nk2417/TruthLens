Kate Winslet has revealed that another major Hollywood actor was in the pipeline to play Kate\u2019s love interest, Jack.\n\nIn an interview on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Kate spilled the deets by telling us that she originally auditioned to play the part alongside Matthew McConaughey.\n\nAlright, alright, alright\u2026\n\nKate confirmed: \u201cI auditioned with Matthew, isn\u2019t that weird?\u201d And although it was \u201ccompletely fantastic,\u201d she added \u201cit just wouldn\u2019t have been the whole, Jack and Rose, Kate and Leo thing.\u201d\n\nWe AGREE.\n\nKate also made the shocking revelation that she never ever listens to Celine Dion\u2019s My Heart Will Go On, the song that basically made The Titanic movie the hit that it is.\n\nShe then went on to spill more gossip on the movie, describing that the famous car sex scene was \u201cunscripted\u201d and \u201csweaty\u201d as well as recalling her near hypothermia experience after filming the scene in the water.\n\nYou can check out the whole interview here, we love it.\n\nAlthough we love Matthew, nothing will ever come between our love for Kate and Leo (especially 1990\u2019s Leo).", "images":
