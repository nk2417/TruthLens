In case you're a newbie (hi, welcome!), K-pop stands for Korean pop, and it's a worldwide phenomenon we think everyone should get on board with.\n\nK-pop is a music category that embraces multiple genres, including pop (ofc), R&B, rap, EDM, rock, and more. So, as you can probably imagine, there's literally a group or song for everyone. But trust, the international genre isn't just about the addictive music\u2014you can also always count on the musical groups to have the most slick choreo and amazing music videos.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the list of recommendations is infinite, we've rounded up 25 of the best K-pop bands we think make the perfect introduction to the music category. In no particular order, these are all our faves to add to your playlists now.\n\nVIVIZ\n\nThe all-women trio VIVIZ is a relatively new name in the industry. However, it's entirely comprised of former GFRIEND members, so there's no lack of playlist power here. Their song \"Bop Bop\" is a fun electro-pop dose of nostalgia. If you want a more classic pop bop, you should check out their song \"MANIAC.\"\n\nGOT7\n\nThese guys have had an absolutely bonkers few years, and I suggest you get up to speed on them now. Their 2022 self-titled EP is a must-listen, which comes as literally no surprise. But what really makes them so lovable is their chemistry\u2014they've got hilarious brotherly energy in any given interview, and after a quick YouTube binge, you almost feel like part of the band.\n\n\n\nBTS\n\n\n\nCan we really talk K-pop without mentioning BTS? Don\u2019t think so. Although on a hiatus atm, BTS is arguably *the* most popular K-pop group in the world, and with good reason. Their accolades include becoming the first artists in iTunes history to have eight songs hit number one in 100 countries, breaking the record for most viewers for a YouTube premiere, and absolutely crushing a U.S. stadium tour.\n\nWow, right? With three rappers (RM, Suga, and J-Hope) and four singers (Jin, Jimin, V, and Jungkook), the group mixes hip-hop, pop, some EDM, and rap into their body of work, addressing love and mental health issues with their music. It just takes watching one of their videos to understand why they became such a global phenomenon.\n\nBLACKPINK\n\nOnce you welcome Jennie Kim, Lisa, Jisoo, and Ros\u00e9 into your life, it\u2019ll be hard to let them go. Considered one of this generation's most popular K-pop acts, BLACKPINK's songs all become hits\u2014I challenge you to listen to any song and not get it stuck in your head for days. They\u2019ve made history on music charts over the years with their dynamic and bold songs plus amazing choreography you'll feel the itching need to learn.\n\nMONSTA X\n\nK-pop\u2019s bad boys definitely deserve a spot on your playlist. Topping multiple music charts and breaking hearts all over the place, MONSTA X's popularity continues to surge, and you'll understand why the minute you hit play. Bringing some hip-hop, EDM, and pop to the plate, every MONSTA X song is a universe you\u2019ll want to immerse yourself in. Layers and layers of fierce vocals meet vehement rap lines in the songs, which make you a Monbebe in a heartbeat.\n\nTWICE\n\nGet to know K-pop's sweethearts right here. TWICE's melodic tunes and mix of different styles make them one of the most addictive South Korean acts to see. With a sound as sparkly as their personalities, the nine queens of the bubblegum style were set for fame from their debut in 2015. Since then, it\u2019s been hit after hit after hit!\n\nEXO\n\nMeet your new boyfriends. With their vocals, good-boy-gone-bad vibes, and music videos you won\u2019t be able to stop replaying, EXO has reached the hearts of their fans for a reason\u2026or, well, many reasons. They've tried every concept you can imagine\u2014sexy, cute, bad boy, bubbly, etc.\u2014while reinventing themselves, and it's admirable as hell that they pull every style off well.\n\n\n\nATEEZ\n\nATEEZ has only been together for five years, but it truly feels like they have been doing this forever. After having arguably one of the most powerful debuts in K-pop history, this group has taken the world by storm. Featuring strong vocals, powerful rap, and oh-so-intense choreography, the new kids in town are here to stay and no one can ignore them.\n\nRed Velvet\n\nWith Irene, Seulgi, Wendy, Joy, and Yeri, you get the best of both worlds: the sweet and the bold, the sparkly and the sexy, the red and...the velvet? The group has been shaking up the charts all over the world for the past few years, always surprising their fans with unexpected new sounds, concepts, and English versions of their hits.\n\nNCT\n\nOne the the largest K-pop groups in the world, NCT features over 20 members, but they do not perform all together. The group is divided into subunits NCT127, NCT U, NCT Dream, and WayV. NCT Dream embraces more of a young, bright feel, while NCT U is a special unit where members rotate based on specific concepts. NCT 127 is considered Seoul\u2019s representative group, while WayV stands in as a Chinese group. It may be a bit confusing at the beginning, but once you deep dive into their powerful songs and outstanding videos, you\u2019ll become NCT-ed.\n\nGirls' Generation\n\n\n\nWanna add some classics to your list? Girls' Generation is what you need. In addition to a massive 15th-anniversary album, there\u2019s a big chance they already got you (or someone you know) into K-pop in the first place. Known as SNSD in Korea, these nine (now eight!) performers were considered the ultimate girl group, capturing everyone\u2019s hearts with their youthful, vibrant songs and videos. Their signature electro-bubblegum sound matured with time while their audience saw them turn from girls into women right in front of their eyes.\n\nRelated Story Tiffany Young Is Not the New Girl\n\nITZY\n\nITZY earned their previous \"monster rookie\" nickname for a reason\u2014they're damn good at everything they do. While their larger-than-life pop music focuses heavily on embracing uniqueness and practicing unconditional self-love, their dances are some of the hardest in the industry. (See: all the comments about fans breaking their shoulders attempting the \"Wannabe\" choreo.) Prepare to sweat\u2014and expect to pull a muscle or two, just being honest\u2014while attempting their most popular moves.\n\n(G)I-DLE\n\nWant a group that can give you any genre under the sun? Look no further than (G)I-DLE\u2014the stars manage to flawlessly blend everything from tropical house and Latin pop to hip-hop without batting a single eyelash. Even cooler? (G)I-DLE is super involved in the creation of their music, with members Soyeon, Minnie, and Yuqi lending their talents to writing production on their records.\n\nSuperM\n\nThe \"super\" in SuperM pretty much stands for supergroup, TBH. All seven of the group's members already come from successful K-pop groups\u2014EXO, WayV, NCT 127, and SHINee\u2014making for some MAJOR star power from these dudes. With immaculate choreo, amazing raps, and stunning visuals, this group quite literally has it all.\n\nSHINee\n\nFormed back in 2008\u2014almost two whole decades ago!\u2014Onew, Key, Minho, and Taemin (as well as former member Jonghyun, who sadly passed away in 2017) are considered the \"princes of K-pop\" for their impact on the genre. Come for the unbelievably intricate dance routines, stay for the infectious R&B...and *really* cute dudes.\n\n\n\nSuper Junior\n\nSuper Junior was one of the groups that ushered in what stans call the \"second generation\" of K-Pop, which helped popularize the genre globally. And now, they're back!...though they never really left. Since they debuted in 2005, they've been releasing new music on and off, s some members went on to do their obligatory military service. \"Sorry Sorry,\" \"Bonamana\" and \"Devil\" are some of my personal faves.\n\n\n\nSeventeen\n\nDon't get overwhelmed by their numbers. Seventeen is very obviously a huge ensemble, but they're a multi-talented one. Each member is integral in forming the group's sound and image. Some highly-recommended hits that I find on my regular K-Pop rotation are \"Rock with You\" and \"Snap Shoot.\"\n\nIVE\n\nIVE debuted in 2021 and soon made a splash with their first single, \"Eleven.\" They've got a total of six members: Yujin, Gaeul, Rei, Wonyoung, Liz, and Leeseo. Watch the video above and you'll see exactly what all the hype is about.\n\nStray Kids\n\nStray Kids was formed through a 2017 reality show of the same name, and the group later officially debuted in 2018. They also have a rap sub-unit definitely worth listening to called 3RACHA, which is made up of their members Bang Chan, Changbin, and Han.\n\nSTAYC\n\nFor those looking for a fresh take on the classic K-pop experience, the group STAYC has embraced the themes of previous eras while still concocting a new, colorful sound. From the production-heavy bubblegum design of their hit \u201cASAP\u201d to the dark-horse R&B-tinted influence of their rather rich track \u201cComplex,\u201d these women have shown that they have what it takes to alter the glittery side of the industry but aren\u2019t exclusively committed to staying in one lane either.\n\nLE SSERAFIM\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the title of a K-pop group\u2019s debut song suggests that they\u2019re going for bold, you can guarantee the rest of their work is going to be unapologetically gutsy. Girl group LE SSERAFIM from Source Music is no exception; they dropped their record-breaking debut EP Fearless with the title track by the same name. But it\u2019s actually the group\u2019s vibey b-side additions like \u201cBlue Flame\u201d and \u201cSour Grapes\u201d that\u2019ll have you invested in their next big move.\n\n\n\n\u00e6spa\n\n\u00e6spa debuted together in 2020, and ever since, the unique concept behind their group has captivated fans of K-pop. Members Karina, Winter, Giselle, and NingNing have virtual versions of themselves living in another dimension called \"FLAT\" named \u00e6-Karina, \u00e6-Winter, \u00e6-Giselle, and \u00e6-NingNing. Cool, huh? \u00e6spa also has some pop BANGERS. At the end of 2020, the band released their debut single, \"Black Mamba.\" When the music vid premiered, it broke the record for the highest-viewed debut video for a K-pop group in 24 hours\u2014a truly impressive feat. Be on the lookout for more hits from them, such as their recent hit \"Savage\" or their first English track, \"Life's Too Short.\"\n\nBB Girls\n\nThe reverse-charting group BB Girls (previously known as Brave Girls) is likely the most resilient group you\u2019ll discover on this list. The group is a prime example of an authentic K-pop underdog story, going from disbanding in early 2023 to gaining massive traction with their most recent release under a new label and name.\n\nWeekly\n\nWanna satisfy your sweet tooth? Weekly is the group for you! Specializing in upbeat and youthful pop, Weekly's songs are bound to lift your spirits if you're feeling down. Check out some of their bops like \"Yummy!,\" \"Tag Me (@Me),\" and their latest song, \"Stranger\" for tons of fun.\n\nP1Harmony\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever come across a single or music video by the hip-hop-inspired boyband P1Harmony, you\u2019re already acutely aware of how talented they are. If you haven\u2019t, you're definitely missing out. Their recent uptempo tracks like \u201cFall in Love Again\u201d and \u201cKillin' It\u201d are must-listens, and to experience their silky vocal range, make sure to check out \u201cIf You Call Me.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523000000&id=social-button-icon",
