In the past, such moves would\u2019ve taken all season, thanks to traveling on horseback or by boat. Nowadays, it\u2019s like the characters invented the Hyperloop off-screen, which would\u2019ve helped Daenerys instead of waiting six seasons to get her to Westeros.\n\nThis new breakneck speed has characters teleporting all over the Westerosi map in a move by showrunners, D.B. Weiss and David Benioff to get to the final, important plot threads.\n\n\u201cThings are moving faster because in the world of these characters the war that they\u2019ve been waiting for is upon them,\u201d Weiss explained in an Entertainment Weekly interview. \u201cThe conflicts that have been building the past six years are upon them and those facts give them a sense of urgency that makes [the characters] move faster.\u201d\n\nWhile it makes sense practically, the transition has only served as a distraction for longtime viewers \u2014 drawing attention to the pacing and the movement of time when they should be focusing on narrative and character.\n\nIt also breaks away from George R.R. Martin\u2019s novels. The show diverges from the source material at a certain point in all respects, but tweaking with how the story plays with time and distance only shows that the showrunners and HBO are missing a key theme and a deliberate move by Martin to build tension.\n\nThe \u201cSong of Ice and Fire\u201d books are almost too long thanks in part to how much time Martin puts into traveling. Readers won\u2019t read passages about the intricacies of travel \u2014 how to pitch a camp or how to get food, for example \u2014 but a lot of the events of the first three novels revolve around transit. The fact that it takes forever for characters to get from one city to another is the device used to instigate events.\n\nHow the act of movement affects the characters can be clearly seen with Arya Stark, who spends most of her time throughout these books getting from one place to another. The first book, \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d has her going from Winterfell to King\u2019s Landing. After her father\u2019s death, she gets caught up in a series of unfortunate distractions, whether it\u2019s being captured at Harrenhal (while on the way to the Night\u2019s Watch) or being taken hostage by the Hound.\n\nShe eventually gains her freedom and travels to Braavos, where she apprentices with the Faceless Men. It\u2019s around this time when the books and the show diverge. The books end with Arya losing her eyesight, which viewers will remember occurs at the end of Season 5. Season 6 then is about Arya gaining her sight back and going through another separate moral crisis.\n\nThat\u2019s when the pacing starkly (pun intended) changes. Remember how it took Arya essentially four seasons to get to Braavos? Sometime in between the eighth episode of Season 6 and the finale (episode 10), she manages to get from the island to the Twins. She would\u2019ve had to cross the Narrow Sea \u2014 the body of water that runs in between Westeros and Essos \u2014 and then cross the bulk of Westeros to even get to the Frey stronghold. This is a long journey, yet she\u2019s able to do it in less than three episodes. She also has time to kill and cook each of Walder Frey\u2019s sons into a pie.\n\nThis change of pace has only become more clear in Season 7, as the showrunners work to close all open story threads. In Season 6, the sudden location jumps were different, but because the plots didn\u2019t revolve around one character having to meet with another or a group going off to war, it didn\u2019t matter as much. Season 7, over the first three episodes at the time of this writing, has consisted primarily of characters practically teleporting to other locations that are hundreds of miles away.\n\nNormally this wouldn\u2019t be much of a problem. There is limited time left in \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to be worrying about what a character like Jon Snow is doing on the way to Dragonstone or if he encounters any conflicts. However, when the pace of a show is consistent for five seasons and then immediately becomes the opposite, the change is distracting.\n\nAnd while the show is its own entirely separate work, the change in pacing is also a dramatic departure from the source material, which frequently emphasizes long, difficult (and often boring) travel, during which you\u2019re all but cut off from channels of communication, as an inconvenient fact of life in Westeros. That distance keeps characters utterly out of the loop at critical times, a frequent source of dramatic irony and tension.\n\nThat aspect paid off well in the TV series. In Season 3, for example, as we see Arya slowly make her way to the Twins, we\u2019re also witnessing what will eventually become the Red Wedding. The parallel journeys and how they intersect makes Arya\u2019s timing and observance of her brother and mother\u2019s deaths only made the scene more heartbreaking. This is even more apparent in the books, as Arya only learns about the event in bits and pieces over the next few chapters.\n\nHowever, none of this is more apparent than with the core conflict of the show \u2014 the fight against the White Walkers. Jon and the rest of the Night\u2019s Watch know about the impending undead doom and have been slowly trying to solve the incoming apocalypse while the rest of Westeros is engaged in war. This distance allows scenes like the one in Season 7 episode 3 where Jon tries to convince Daenerys of the Walkers\u2019 existence possible. Because travel to the North would be complicated, nobody south of Winterfell knows anything about the true nature of winter.\n\nSubsequently, the distance between the cities in the North, the capital in the South and the cities in Essos where Daenerys had been holed up for six seasons, ensured that those stories remained appropriately separate. While Season 7 shows that these stories are finally intersecting, it doesn\u2019t make much sense when the White Walkers are only now a hop and a skip away from King\u2019s Landing, if the new travel is any indication. It throws what we\u2019ve been taught over six seasons into chaos.\n\nGranted, the White Walkers are barred from traveling south because The Wall is infused with magic that prevents the dead from passing it \u2014 but once The Wall is breached, as it surely must be, will the overrun Westeros as quickly as Jaime went from King\u2019s Landing to Highgarden in the third Season 7 episode?\n\nIt\u2019s clear that the showrunners have deemed the pacing change as the best means of finishing up \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d in the limited time frame they\u2019ve imposed on themselves. (By design, Season 7 has only seven episodes, and Season 8 will have only six). However, in the process the show is losing a significant part of what made it \u2014 and the books on which it is based \u2014 so fascinating.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the slow pacing is inherently better than the opposite. But this particular tale has long been defined by, and benefitted from, a pacing that is purposefully slow. As a result, the dramatic change in pace proves to be a needless distraction just as the show is (finally) getting close to the finale we\u2019ve been waiting for since 2011.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/arya-stark-game-of-thrones.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/5x4_082025_COVER_B.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/arya-stark-game-of-thrones.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carli Velocci", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid", "Border-Radius Box-Shadow Rgba", "Rgba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/game-of-thrones-pacing-commentary/", "title": "\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Is Moving at a Breakneck Speed \u2014 And That\u2019s a Problem (Commentary)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Game of Thrones' Is Moving at a Breakneck Speed -- And That's a Problem (Commentary)", "description": "It's tough to accept a rapidly-moving story when the show has only benefited from slow pacing", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/game-of-thrones-pacing-commentary/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/arya-stark-game-of-thrones.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/png"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-04T00:07:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-04T17:24:05+00:00"}, "author": "Carli Velocci", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@velocciraptor", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Carli Velocci", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "7 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "a_song_of_ice_and_fire, arya-stark, db_weiss, david_benioff, game-of-thrones, george-r-r-martin, hbo, jon-snow", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "game-of-thrones, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501805223.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
