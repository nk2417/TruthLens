Griffin was fired from her post last spring after she posed for a controversial photo in which she was shown holding what appears to be the decapitated head of President Donald Trump.\n\nGriffin apologized, but later retracted any expression of remorse. Cooper publicly condemned Griffin for taking the photo and the comedian has since revealed that her friendship with the CNN anchor ended because of the scandal.\n\nCNN will live-stream New Year\u2019s Eve coverage, without requiring log-in to a cable provider, on Dec. 31 from 8 p.m.-1:05 a.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/andy_cohen_anderson_cooper_-_publicity_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/andy_cohen_anderson_cooper_-_publicity_-_h_2018.jpg?w=2000&h=1126&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/andy_cohen_anderson_cooper_-_publicity_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evan Real", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/anderson-cooper-andy-cohen-set-host-cnns-new-years-eve-again-1166257/", "title": "Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen Set to Host CNN\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve Again", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "CNN on Tuesday announced that Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen will host the network's upcoming New Year's Eve celebration in New York for a second year in a row.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Evan Real", "tags": "Anderson Cooper, Andy Cohen, CNN", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen Set to Host CNN\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve Again", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/anderson-cooper-andy-cohen-set-host-cnns-new-years-eve-again-1166257/", "description": "CNN on Tuesday announced that Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen will host the network's upcoming New Year's Eve celebration in New York for a second year in a row.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/andy_cohen_anderson_cooper_-_publicity_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen Set to Host CNN's New Year's Eve Again"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-12-04T12:37:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-17T23:10:25+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "CNN on Tuesday announced that Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen will host the network's upcoming New Year's Eve celebration in New York for a second year in a row.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen Set to Host CNN\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve Again", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/andy_cohen_anderson_cooper_-_publicity_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543927050.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
