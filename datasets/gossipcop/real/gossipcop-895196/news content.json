woman who crashed her car in California on Sunday.\n\nThe \u201cStar Wars\u201d actor was driving east on a freeway near Santa Barbara when the female driver in front of him lost control of her ride, swerved off the road and smashed into an embankment, according to TMZ.\n\nFord switched into action-hero mode \u2014 slamming on his brakes and swooping in to help.\n\nSporting his own version of a superhero costume \u2014 a sensible button-down shirt and sunglasses \u2014 the 75-year-old star bolted to her gray sedan.\n\nHe and other good Samaritans then pulled her from the car as paramedics arrived, a witness told the celebrity news site.\n\nThe lucky lady was transported from the site of the accident, on California State Route 126, to a hospital.\n\nShe suffered only minor injuries, law-enforcement sources told the site.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time the actor has played a noble role off screen.\n\nIn September, a Midtown tunnel pile-up cause his Mercedes Benz to get stuck between cars, so he hopped out and began directing traffic, video footage shows.\n\nFord was also recently the victim of an accident himself when engine trouble forced him to land his private plane on a golf course in Santa Monica in 2015.\n\nThe Oscar-nominated actor has appeared in movies such as \u201cIndiana Jones,\u201d \u201cPatriot Games\u201d and \u201cThe Fugitive.\u201d", "images":
