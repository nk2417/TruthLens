Disick then also flew to France and was spotted partying with multiple women over multiple days.\n\n\u201cLook at it in my perspective. She was on vacation with one man, a whole trip,\u201d Disick, 34, explains to Kim. \u201cThat looks like a happier scenario than me, jumping around, trying to find happiness and these girls are not fulfilling that. I\u2019m just not happy with anybody.\u201d\n\nRelated: Kourtney Kardashian and Younes Bendjima\u2019s Sexy Romance in Pictures From Los Angeles to France, Kourtney Kardashian can\u2019t stop showing off her hot romance with model Younes Bendjima \u2014 click through to see the couple\u2019s sexiest moments\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s beyond the girls at this point. I think if you found someone that you were happy with, I think Kourtney would be happy for you, but she sees you out and really drinking and really going through it, she just had concern,\u201d Kim answers, which shocks Disick. \u201cShe sure didn\u2019t say that,\u201d he responds.\n\nDuring his confessional, the father of Mason, 7, Penelope 5, and Reign, 2, reveals that Cannes \u201cwasn\u2019t good\u201d and he understands that his messy life looks bad. \u201cI don\u2019t live the cleanest looking life. I\u2019m a guy, I\u2019m a little younger. Maybe the way I\u2019m getting over her is a drop different, and it\u2019s hard,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t really know what to do. If I step out of line in one way, I could lose everybody in a matter of seconds.\u201d\n\nRelated: Cutest Kardashian Kids Moments: North, Mason, Dream and More! Kim, Rob and Kourtney Kardashian have the cutest kids \u2014 see photos of cousins North and Saint West, Dream Kardashian and Mason, Penelope and Reign Disick!\n\nThat\u2019s when he admits the \u201cscary\u201d thought he has in the back of his head: the fear that if his ex settles down with someone else, the family won\u2019t \u201cneed to be close\u201d with him anymore. Kim, of course, reassures Disick that they\u2019ll \u201calways\u201d be close, and tells him to worry about that when it happens.\n\nThe clip ends with Kim revealing in her confessional that he is taking \u201ca little big longer \u2014 or a lot longer \u2014 than Kourtney\u201d is when it comes to adjusting to life apart.\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs on E!
