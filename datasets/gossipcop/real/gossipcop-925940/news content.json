For other people with the same name, see Travis Scott (disambiguation)\n\nJacques Bermon Webster II (born April 30, 1991), known professionally as Travis Scott (formerly stylized as Travi$ Scott), is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Scott has had five number-one hits on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart, along with a total of over one hundred charting songs. In addition to ten Grammy Award nominations, he has won a Latin Grammy Award, Billboard Music Award, MTV Video Music Award, and several BET Hip Hop Awards.[9] Scott's musical style has been described as a \"blend between traditional hip-hop and lo-fi\" and often characterized as \"ambient,\" drawing notable influence from rappers Kanye West and Kid Cudi. His stage name is derived from the latter's real name, Scott Mescudi, combined with the name of a favorite uncle.\n\nIn 2012, Scott signed his first major-label recording contract with Epic Records, as well as a publishing deal with Kanye West's GOOD Music as an in-house producer. In April 2013, he entered a joint-venture record deal with Georgia-based rapper T.I.'s Grand Hustle Records. Scott self-released his first full-length project, a mixtape titled Owl Pharaoh in 2013, which was followed by his debut mixtape, Days Before Rodeo (2014). His debut studio album, Rodeo (2015), was met with critical and commercial success; it spawned the singles \"3500\" (featuring Future and 2 Chainz) and \"Antidote\", the latter peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100. His second album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight (2016), became his first number-one album on the Billboard 200 chart.

It yielded his first Billboard Hot 100 number-one single, \"Sicko Mode\" (featuring Drake).[10] In late 2019, Scott's vanity label imprint, Cactus Jack Records, released the compilation album JackBoys, which also topped the Billboard 200. With his 2019 single \"Highest in the Room\" and his 2020 singles \"The Scotts\" (with Kid Cudi) and \"Franchise\" (featuring Young Thug and M.I.A.), Scott became the first artist on the Billboard Hot 100 to have three songs debut at number one in less than a year.[11] Following a series of controversies and five years after the release of his previous solo album, Scott released Utopia (2023), which became his fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200 and spawned the Billboard Hot 100 top-ten singles \"Meltdown\" (featuring Drake), \"Fein\" (featuring Playboi Carti), and \"K-pop\" (with Bad Bunny and The Weeknd). In 2025, he released the single \"4x4\", which peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100. His second collaboration with JackBoys, JackBoys 2, charted atop the Billboard 200, making it Scott's sixth consecutive number-one album overall on the chart.\n\nAlong with his highly publicized relationship with American media personality Kylie Jenner, Scott has collaborated with organizations including Nike, Dior, and McDonald's. His Cactus Jack record label, founded in 2017, has signed artists including Don Toliver and Sheck Wes. Scott has gained notoriety for controversies and legal issues regarding concert safety. In November 2021, a mass-casualty crowd crush occurred during Scott's hometown performance at his annual Astroworld Festival, causing ten deaths and hundreds of injuries.[12][13][14]\n\nEarly life\n\nJacques Bermon Webster II[15] was born on April 30, 1991, in Houston, Texas, the son of Wanda, who worked for AT&T, and Jacques Webster Sr., an entrepreneur and musician.[16] From ages one through six, Webster lived with his grandmother in South Park, Houston. The neighborhood was notorious for crime and had an impact on a young Webster, \"Growing up, my grandmother stayed in the 'hood so I seen random crazy shit. [I saw] mad bums and crazy spazzed out motherfuckers, I saw people looking weird, hungry, and grimey [sic]. I was always like, 'I gotta get the fuck out this shit.' It gave me my edge\u2014[it made me] who I am right now.\"[17]\n\nWebster moved to Missouri City, a middle-class suburban area bordering southwest Houston, to live with his parents. His mother worked for Apple and his father ran his own business.[18] Webster's father is also a soul musician and his grandfather was a jazz composer.[19] Webster attended Elkins High School and graduated at seventeen.[20] During high school, he participated in musical theater.[21] Webster then attended the University of Texas at San Antonio, before dropping out his second year to fully pursue his music career.[22][23]\n\nDuring an interview, Webster revealed he chose his moniker as a combination of his favorite uncle, Travis, and the first name of one of his biggest inspirations, Kid Cudi (whose real name is Scott Mescudi).[24]\n\nCareer\n\n2008\u20132012: Career beginnings and record deals\n\nWebster formed a duo with his longtime friend Chris Holloway known as The Graduates.

After moving to New York, Scott slept on the floor at his friend's house and spent most of his time at Just Blaze's studio. Eventually frustrated in New York and the lack of progression,[27] Scott moved to Los Angeles, California, after only four months in the state.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Webster was abandoned by his friend who had promised to help him by providing housing. His parents cut him off financially and he eventually was forced to relocate back to Houston, where his parents kicked him out of their home. Webster moved back to Los Angeles once again and began to sleep on the couch of a friend who studied at University of Southern California.[28] Atlanta-based rapper and owner of Grand Hustle Records, T.I. would later hear one of Webster's productions, titled \"Lights (Love Sick)\".

The live stream also showcased snippets of songs from his upcoming fourth studio album Utopia featuring a song with Westside Gunn and instrumentals from the album.[140] In later 2022, Scott and Skepta, a British grime MC, rapper, and record producer, headlined an event hosted by Virgil Abloh Securities. The one-day music festival was held at the FPL Solar Amphitheater in Miami, Florida, U.S. The event took place to honor the late Virgil Abloh's legacy called Mirror Mirror.[141] Since then, Scott has partnered both creatively and as the face of several clothing lines for luxury fashion houses like Helmut Lang and Saint Laurent.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2025, Scott was appointed Chief Visionary Officer by the eyewear brand Oakley, a role intended to influence the company\u2019s creative direction.[142]\n\nNotable Sneaker collaborations\n\nScott's sneakers collections are listed below:[143]\n\nHelmut Lang, launched in 2017\n\nJordan Trunner LX, launched in 2017\n\nNike Air Force 1, launched in 2017\n\nAir Jordan 4 \"Cactus Jack\", launched in 2018\n\nAir Jordan 4 \"Purple Suede\", launched in 2018\n\nAir Jordan 4 \"Olive\", launched in 2018\n\nNike Air Force 1 \"Sail,\" launched in 2018\n\nAir Jordan 1, launched in 2019\n\nAir Jordan 1 Low \"Grammy\", launched in 2019\n\nAir Jordan 33, launched in 2019\n\nAir Jordan 6, launched in 2019\n\nAir Jordan 1 Low, launched in 2019\n\nNike Air Force 1, launched in 2019\n\nNike SB Dunk Low, launched in 2020\n\nNike Air Max 270 React ENG, launched in 2020\n\nAir Jordan 6 \"British Khaki\", launched in 2021\n\nAir Jordan 1 High OG x Fragment, launched on June 29, 2021\n\nAir Jordan 1 Low OG x Fragment, launched on August 13, 2021 [ 144 ]\n\nAir Jordan 1 High OG, launched in 2021\n\nNike Air Max 1, launched in 2022\n\nNike Air Trainer 1, launched in 2022\n\nAir Jordan 1 Low \"Reverse Mocha\", launched in 2022\n\nDior B713, launched in 2022\n\nFortnite collaborations\n\nIn 2020, Scott and his Cactus Jack team collaborated with Epic Games to launch new merchandise inspired by the Fortnite game, including clothing, action figures, and Nerf guns.

They also uploaded a special unboxing video of the PlayStation 5 console to YouTube.[156] The video features footage of Scott playing the console alongside fans, a piano performance by James Blake, and a tribute to Pop Smoke.\n\nThe Scotts\n\nAside from his solo musical career, Scott is also one-half of the alternative hip-hop super-duo the Scotts, alongside his mentor and frequent collaborator, American musician Kid Cudi. They have currently been working on their debut collaborative effort since 2020, when the duo released the Billboard Hot 100 number one single, \"The Scotts\".[157] In December 2022, Cudi revealed they were no longer working on the album, effectively announcing its cancellation.[158] However in July 2023, Cudi stated the album \"is [definitely] happening at some point.\"[159][160]\n\nFilm industry\n\nScott made his theatrical debut in the 2021 film Gully as a movie store owner.[161] He also contributed to the film's soundtrack but his song \"Knife\" was cut due to sampling issues, but was still featured briefly in the film. On August 2, 2021, Scott signed a movie production deal with A24. The same day he announced the completion of a draft for a film based on his then-upcoming fourth studio album Utopia, which would later be revealed to be Circus Maximus.[162]\n\nProfessional wrestling\n\nScott started making appearances for American professional wrestling promotion WWE in 2025. He would make his professional wrestling debut on January 6, 2025, where Scott appeared in-person at WWE Raw's premiere on Netflix, in which his song's title, \"4x4\", was revealed and was confirmed to serve as the program's opening theme. He would escort professional wrestler Jey Uso to the ring before his match.[163] Scott would appear at the Elimination Chamber: Toronto event on March 1, 2025, where he accompanied Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson to the ring ahead of Rock's segment with then-Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes. When John Cena betrayed Rhodes during the segment, Scott assisted Rock and Cena in attacking Rhodes, establishing himself as a villain.[164] It was reported that Scott injured Cody when he attacked him by throwing an improper punch to the side of Cody's face, causing a \"busted eardrum and a black eye\".[165] Scott would appear at WrestleMania 41 Night 2 on April 20, 2025, where he walked out to his song \"Fein\" (one of the official theme songs of the event), and interfered in the main event between Rhodes and Cena for the Undisputed WWE Championship. He would be taken out with a Cross Rhodes by Cody,[166] but would ultimately help Cena win his record 17th world championship in WWE.[167] It was reported that Scott would make his in-ring debut in a tag team match teaming up with Cena against Rhodes and another celebrity, however those plans were scrapped as it was reported that Scott and WWE had a \"falling out\". This would also lead to his removal as a surprise celebrity DLC character for the video game WWE 2K25. It was also reported that the reason WWE had featured Travis Scott so heavily is that the chief executive officer (CEO) of WWE's parent company TKO Ari Emanuel has promised Scott the spot as a \"favor\" and that WWE saw Scott as \"lazy\" and was \"difficult to work with\".[168][169][170]\n\nArtistry\n\nInfluences\n\nScott performing in 2017\n\nScott has stated that Bj\u00f6rk is \"one of my biggest inspirations for why I do what I do\".[171] He is also influenced by Bon Iver, Kid Cudi, M.I.A., Kanye West, Toro y Moi, Tame Impala, T.I., and Thom Yorke.[172][173][174]\n\nMusical style\n\nScott makes heavy use of audio manipulation effects such as Auto-Tune, phasing, delays, and stereo-sculpted chorusing and harmony structures,[175] predominantly influenced by producers Mike Dean and Alex Tumay.[176] Scott's musical style has been characterized as \"ambient\";[175][177] Scott himself has said \"I'm not hip-hop\".[174] Vulture described Scott's sound as \"unremittingly dark, syncretic, hi-res, and above all unnatural\".[178] Scott's musical style has been described as being hip-hop,[179] \"psychedelic\" trap,[1][179] and pop rap.[1] Spin magazine compared his debut mixtape Owl Pharaoh (2013) to fellow American rapper Kid Cudi's Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager (2010).[180]\n\nCreative vision\n\nIn 2016, Harmony Korine, an American filmmaker, teamed with Scott and fellow American rapper Gucci Mane to release a collaborative music video for their collaboration \"Last Time\"; Korine made a cameo appearance in the short directed by David Helman.[181]\n\nIn 2018, Scott has said that he is a fan of Broadway theatre and would like to do an album of show tune covers. He has said that he would like to write his own musical in the future.[182][183][184]\n\nIn 2021, Scott starred in a cover story of i-D Magazine Issue 362 \"Utopia in Dystopia\" photographed by Spike Jonze. Scott graced two covers for the issue, including a limited-edition cover featuring original artwork by Jonze. Scott teamed up with i-D Magazine for a limited edition merch capsule release. Scott added his original signature artwork to the special edition issue of the magazine. His classic scrawled artwork also makes an appearance on the Travis Scott X i-D collaborative merch.[citation needed]\n\nScott has also collaborated with the photographer David LaChappelle. Scott's album Astroworld's cover art was reportedly shot by LaChappelle. The artwork featured a large golden replica of Scott's head.[185]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nCactus Jack Foundation\n\nScott established the Cactus Jack Foundation in November 2020 to assist Houston youth with education expenses and creative endeavors.[186] In December 2021, the foundation gave out thousands of toys to the children of Houston.[187] On May 17, 2022, Scott announced that he would give away $1 million in scholarships to 100 HBCU college students from the graduating class of 2022 through the Cactus Jack Foundation.[188]\n\nProject Heal\n\nIn 2022, Scott launched a multi-tier, long-term series of community-focused philanthropy and investment efforts called Project HEAL through his Cactus Jack Foundation. The philanthropic effort provided $5 million for community-based initiatives in Scott's home state of Texas. Project HEAL is a multi-tier initiative dedicated to addressing challenges facing today's youth, especially those from marginalized and at-risk communities.[189]\n\nPersonal life\n\nScott began dating media personality and businesswoman Kylie Jenner in April 2017.[190] In February 2018, Jenner gave birth to their daughter.[191][192] Jenner appeared in the music video for \"Stop Trying to Be God\", from Scott's third studio album Astroworld.[193] They broke up in September 2019,[194] but quarantined together during the COVID-19 pandemic for the sake of their daughter and ended up rekindling their relationship.[195] On September 7, 2021, after weeks of speculation, Jenner revealed that she and Scott were expecting their second child.[196] Jenner gave birth to their son in February 2022.[197][198][199] The couple separated for a second time by January 2023.[200]\n\nLegal issues\n\nIncidents at performances\n\nScott's performances have experienced a number of issues. At Lollapalooza in 2015, Scott was charged and arrested for disorderly conduct after inciting concertgoers to ignore security and rush the stage.[201] For this, he would later plead guilty to reckless conduct and receive one year of supervised release.[202] That same year, at the Openair Festival in Switzerland, he encouraged fans to attack a man who took his shoe while he was crowd-surfing, by stopping the concert and repeatedly telling the crowd to \"fuck him up\", while also spitting on him.[203]\n\nIn 2017, he was arrested for similar conduct to his Lollapalooza behavior after a performance at the Walmart Arkansas Music Pavilion[204] in Northwest Arkansas.[205] That same year, a fan sued Scott and the organizers of a 2017 concert at Terminal 5 in Manhattan after falling from a balcony and being dragged on stage, blaming the fall on a crowd surge.[206] In 2019, three people were trampled and injured as a crowd rushed to enter the compound at Astroworld.[207][208]\n\nAstroworld Festival crowd crush\n\nOn November 5, 2021, at least ten people died and hundreds were injured in a crowd crush moving toward the stage during Scott's performance at the Astroworld Festival in NRG Park in his hometown of Houston, Texas.[14] On the first night, a crowd crush occurred, resulting in the cancellation of the second night of the festival.[13][209][12] In video footage of the incident, Scott is seen continuing to perform despite chants from the crowd pleading for him to stop; observing at least one audience member had been hurt, then ordering security for a brief moment to \"help, jump in real quick, keep going\", only to continue with the rest of the show for the following hour; encouraging people to \"get wild\" and \"crazy\", despite an ambulance passing through the crowd that was pulling out lifeless bodies.[210][211] Victims killed ranged from 9 to 27 years old.[212]\n\nShortly after, a lawsuit was announced by the concertgoers. It was started by Kristian Paredes, who filed for $1,000,000 due to the injuries he received. On June 29, 2023, a Texas grand jury declined to indict Scott in a criminal probe of the crowd surge.[213][214]\n\nNebula assault allegations\n\nOn March 1, 2023, Scott was performing at Nebula, a nightclub in New York City, alongside Don Toliver when a sound technician, identified only as Mark, asked Scott to lower the music as it was too loud for the venue's size. Scott reportedly responded by giving Mark the middle finger and punching him in the head, resulting in Mark needing medical attention and police being called to the scene around 3:25 a.m. Scott had reportedly been drinking alcohol and damaged $12,000 in the club's sound equipment before he left the premises. The New York City Police Department (NYPD) issued a warrant for Scott's arrest in relation to the incident on March 2, 2023.[215][216] The matter was resolved with a settlement reached and the NYPD not pressing any charges.[217][218]\n\nScott's mugshot on June 20, 2024, in Miami\n\nMiami Beach arrest\n\nIn the early hours of June 20, 2024, Scott was arrested in Miami Beach on charges of disorderly intoxication and trespassing property after warning.[219] He was released over six hours later after posting a $650 bond.[220] The same day, Scott would capitalize on this incident by unleashing merchandise containing his mugshot which was taken following the arrest.[221] In August, prosecutors dropped Scott's disorderly intoxication charge whilst continuing to press charges for trespassing after warning.[222]\n\nParis arrest\n\nIn the early hours of August 9, 2024, Scott was arrested in Paris after allegedly getting into a fight with his bodyguard. A security guard at the luxury George V hotel where Scott was staying at intervened, which prompted Scott to attack the security guard as well.[223][224] Scott was released without charges the following day.[225]\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nCollaborative albums\n\nCompilation albums\n\nFilmography\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nTours\n\nHeadlining\n\nSupporting", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/14/Travis_Scott_-_Openair_Frauenfeld_2019_08.jpg/250px-Travis_Scott_-_Openair_Frauenfeld_2019_08.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Travi%24_Scott_2014_2.jpg/250px-Travi%24_Scott_2014_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/2025-0120_Cole_Gahagan_Michael_Rubin_Travis_Scott_%28cropped%29.jpg/960px-2025-0120_Cole_Gahagan_Michael_Rubin_Travis_Scott_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Travis_Scott_sig.svg/250px-Travis_Scott_sig.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/McDonald%27s_sign_reading_%22Cactus_Jack_was_Here%22_in_St._Petersburg%2C_FL%2C_Sep_2020_%28cropped%29.jpg/120px-McDonald%27s_sign_reading_%22Cactus_Jack_was_Here%22_in_St._Petersburg%2C_FL%2C_Sep_2020_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/40px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Travis_Scott_The_DAMN._Tour_%40_TD_Garden_%28Boston%2C_MA%29_%2835709832840%29.jpg/250px-Travis_Scott_The_DAMN._Tour_%40_TD_Garden_%28Boston%2C_MA%29_%2835709832840%29.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/45/Travis_Scott_at_Basel_Castle_2013.jpg/250px-Travis_Scott_at_Basel_Castle_2013.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Travis_Scott_mugshot_%282024%29.jpg/250px-Travis_Scott_mugshot_%282024%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/2025-0120_Cole_Gahagan_Michael_Rubin_Travis_Scott_%28cropped%29.jpg/250px-2025-0120_Cole_Gahagan_Michael_Rubin_Travis_Scott_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b9/McDonald%27s_sign_reading_%22Travis_Scott_was_Here%22_in_St._Petersburg%2C_FL%2C_Sep_2020_%28cropped%29.jpg/120px-McDonald%27s_sign_reading_%22Travis_Scott_was_Here%22_in_St._Petersburg%2C_FL%2C_Sep_2020_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/20px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Travis_Scott_2015_2.jpg/250px-Travis_Scott_2015_2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/2025-0120_Cole_Gahagan_Michael_Rubin_Travis_Scott_%28cropped%29.jpg/960px-2025-0120_Cole_Gahagan_Michael_Rubin_Travis_Scott_%28cropped%29.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travis_Scott", "title": "Travis Scott", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/2025-0120_Cole_Gahagan_Michael_Rubin_Travis_Scott_%28cropped%29.jpg/960px-2025-0120_Cole_Gahagan_Michael_Rubin_Travis_Scott_%28cropped%29.jpg", "width": 775, "height": 1200}, "title": "Travis Scott - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
