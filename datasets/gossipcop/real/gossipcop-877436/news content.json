So, it\u2019s more important than ever to save some money where you can by taking advantage of holiday sales events.\n\nLabor Day weekend, which this year starts on Sept 2 and runs through Monday, Sept 4, is known for offering considerable discounts on pricey items like refrigerators, mattresses, and large furniture pieces. It\u2019s one of the best times of year to purchase these home products, either online or in stores.\n\nAnd while you have the option to shop sales in-person at these stores open on Labor Day, with so many retailers offering free shipping and quick delivery for the holiday \u2014not to mention offering free in-store pickup for online purchases\u2014it might make more sense for you to order online to secure the deal you want\n\nAll weekend long, major retailers like Best Buy, Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, Wayfair, and Walmart will be offering Labor Day sales on some of the most popular items from well-known brands like GE, LG, Dyson, Shark, Tempur-Pedic, and many others. But some of these sales start early and extend after the holiday ends, sometimes up to a week or more, before or after.\n\nHere are some of the best deals we found last year.\n\nGetty Images\n\nLabor Day Appliance Sales\n\nMost major appliance stores, like The Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, and Best Buy, are running competitive sales for the Labor Day weekend this year.\n\nThe home improvement retailer is cutting prices on all types of appliances through Sept. 13. This includes up to $700 off select appliances, plus instant savings of up to $1,000 when you purchase more than one appliance. Buy two appliances and get $100 off or $300 off three, $400 off four, $500 off five, and $1,000 off six or more. The home improvement retailer is also taking $100 off select laundry sets.\n\nThat means you can score some nice discounts on items like refrigerators, washers and dryers, cooktops, ranges, and range hoods, as well as smaller appliances such as vacuums, coffee makers, and toaster ovens. Brand names on sale included LG, Samsung, Frigidaire, KitchenAid, and GE, among others. Free delivery was also included for most large appliances over $369.\n\n\n\nThe big-box home improvement store has one of the largest appliance selections out there, and many highly rated models are on sale for Labor Day. Through Sept. 13, shoppers can get up to $1,500 off select appliances, and get $100 off laundry sets priced at $1,396 or more. Outdoor grills are also selling for up to 40% off. Major appliances from name brands like LG, Whirlpool, Haier, Bosch, and Maytag were on sale, as were smaller items like ice makers, robot vacuums, air conditioners, and air purifiers.\n\nWhile you shop the Labor Day sale at Lowe\u2019s, keep in mind the retailer offers special financing, free in-store pickup, and free local delivery on appliances that cost $396 or more.

You'll also earn Best Buy rewards, which are points you can apply for credit toward future purchases. The retailer offers free delivery on major appliance orders of $399 or more and free standard installation on select products.\n\nThe mass retailer doesn\u2019t carry all of the major appliance brands, but you should be able to find Labor Day deals this year on more budget-friendly names like Avanti, RCA, Midea, Arctic King, and Danby mixed in with some options from Frigidaire, Whirlpool, and GE. If you\u2019re looking for smaller-size appliances, including air fryers and stand mixers, Walmart\u2019s Labor Day sale may be a good bet to get one at a great price.\n\nWhen shopping for appliances during this sale, be careful to look at the \"Sold and Shipped by\" information on the product page. Walmart mixes in products sold by resellers who may have different shipping and return policies.\n\nSamsung is offering several discounts for Labor Day, starting with an offer on home appliance packages that will award you a prepaid Mastercard of up to 10% of the pre-tax subtotal on three or more appliances, or a spend of at least $2,999.

Prices may vary by brand and retailer, so check several before making your final decision.\n\nWhile you\u2019re looking around for the best price, check to see if a retailer will match the price of its competitors. This is advantageous if the return policy or extended warranty, for example, is better at one retailer versus another. Many retailers offer price matching, but if you can\u2019t find the information on the website, check with the store\u2019s customer service.\n\nBuy an older model\n\nWhile you can find deals on new models, the best deals will be reserved for the older ones that brands and retailers are trying to clear from their inventory. With September seeing new washers, dryers, and dishwashers hitting the market, Labor Day sales could be a great time to find price cuts on the older models.\n\nConsider a floor model\n\nIf it\u2019s possible to purchase a mattress or appliance model that\u2019s on display, you can sometimes save big. Plus, if it\u2019s a little scratched or dented and you don\u2019t mind, you can ask if the retailer will discount it further.\n\nUse a credit card with rewards\n\nIf you\u2019re going to use a credit card for a major purchase, you may as well use one that gives you cash-back rewards or points that you can use for later savings. Many credit card companies offer these types of promotions, so take advantage of them if possible.\n\nMore Deals To Save\n\nLearn More\n\nRelated 360 Reviews\n\nWhy You Can Trust Us", "images": ["https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000184-aa41-d967-a5e5-bfefc9e60000/saatva-classic-mattress.png?update-time=1669303821978&size=responsiveFlow300", "https://www.usnews.com/object/image/0000018a-3975-d443-a1fa-bb7ff0300000/castalia-chesterfield-sectional-sofa.jpg?update-time=1693181264078&size=responsiveFlow300", "https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000182-efcb-d602-a5f6-ffdbc35b0000/istock-1332363471.jpg?update-time=1661880603999&size=responsive640", "https://www.usnews.com/static/img/usn-logo-large.svg", "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/2db0791/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F10%2F11%2F7ed7ebda43799134d2ca1cbcd9fb%2Fistock-1332363471.jpg", "https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000142-9255-d33c-abc6-ff554e620001/24462FE_PR_111123gifts.jpg?update-time=1447084634234&size=responsiveSquare150", "https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000186-2714-dbf2-a38f-ff35773d0000/gettyimages-1098390206.jpg?update-time=1675692957767&size=responsiveFlow300", "https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000182-8d55-d6ff-a18e-dd75cc940000/istock-1166892600.jpg?update-time=1660228782235&size=responsiveSquare150", "https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000180-4c60-d41c-a7ed-7d79723a0000/istock-1307615661.jpg?update-time=1650548970208&size=responsiveSquare150", "https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000180-61c1-d187-a5cb-ffdd1def0000/lindsayboyers-headshot-copy.png?update-time=&size=responsiveSquare300", "https://www.usnews.com/object/image/00000182-5f4c-d73d-a5ea-fffcaa390000/kathryn-mccann-core-katie-core.jpg?update-time=1659456524790&size=responsiveSquare300", "https://money.usnews.com/static-atlas/assets/img/usn-logo-large.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.usnews.com/dims4/USNEWS/2db0791/2147483647/thumbnail/970x647/quality/85/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fcmsmedia%2F10%2F11%2F7ed7ebda43799134d2ca1cbcd9fb%2Fistock-1332363471.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Boyers", "Kathryn Core", "David Dritsas", "Aug.", "At A.M."], "canonical_link": "https://deals.usnews.com/deals/best-labor-day-deals", "title": "Best Labor Day Sales 2023", "meta_data": {"optimizely": "Optimizely is supported by this application but is not enabled for this page.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "description": "Look forward to deep discounts on appliances, furniture, and mattresses during Labor Day 2023.
