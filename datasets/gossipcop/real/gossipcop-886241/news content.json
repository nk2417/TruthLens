Everyone knows that the people we love the most are the ones who can \u2014 and usually do \u2014 drive us crazier than anyone else on earth. It\u2019s inexplicable and irrational, but it\u2019s one of life\u2019s many cosmic truths. With all this said, I have a confession to make: Lately, This is Us is working my last nerve.\n\nBefore you start gathering your pitchforks and torches, hear me out. This is Us is a very good show, and it deserves to be the hit that it is. The brilliance of its structure \u2014 telling the story of the Pearson family over past, present, and future timelines \u2014 allows the writers to illustrate our changing perspectives about family in a uniquely affecting way. Like so many of us, the surly, anxious Pearson kids grow up to be contemplative adults who realize \u2014 sometimes far too late \u2014 that their parents were not dictators sent to torment them, but actual people dealing with the same fears, hopes, and dashed dreams we all do.\n\nBut when a show does something really well \u2014 and there\u2019s no series on TV now that delivers \u201call the feels\u201d more effectively than This is Us \u2014 it sometimes leads to a creative stasis, a reluctance to do anything other than what it\u2019s known for. Now that we\u2019re about one-third of the way through season 3, I fear that This is Us has evolved (devolved?) from a multi-layered serial drama into something else, a genre entirely of its own making: The emotional procedural.\n\nJust as we watch Criminal Minds to see the BAU team hunt down psycho-of-the-week, or Law & Order: SVU to witness Olivia Benson sending pervs to prison, we can tune into This is Us certain in the fact that there will be one moment every episode that will, no matter what, fill our tear ducts to the brim. It\u2019s predictable. It\u2019s comfortable. And man, is it starting to get boring. Procedurals absolutely have their place in the TV landscape, but This is Us became a sensation from the very beginning for all the ways it surprised us. Now, the show that proved broadcast TV is still capable of innovation and magic seems willing to settle for rote sentimentality over a full spectrum of storytelling.\n\nOf course, This is Us is a tale built on sadness: How could anyone who lost Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) \u2014 simultaneously the World\u2019s Greatest Dad and World\u2019s Most Romantic Husband \u2014 ever be happy again? But 41 episodes in, it\u2019s time to let the Pearsons (and key Pearson-adjacent characters) be defined by something other than just loss. \u201cNothing ever works out for us,\u201d scowled Middle Kate (Hannah Zeile) during that egg-retrieval dream sequence in \u201cKatie Girls\u201d (October 9). Two weeks later, in \u201cToby,\u201d Grown-Up Kate (Chrissy Metz) reiterated her origin story of sorts to a stranger by the elevator: \u201cWhen sad things happen to me, I tend to shut music out of my life. A lot of sad things have happened to me.\u201d\n\nThe stranger\u2019s response \u2014 \u201cWell, I hope things stay happy!\u201d \u2014 was accidentally laughable, because in order for things to stay happy for Kate, they\u2019d have to get happy first. For every good development (hooray, she\u2019s pregnant!), there\u2019s a \u201cblack cloud\u201d counterpart (boo, Toby\u2019s depression is back!) \u2014 and this doesn\u2019t just happen to Kate. Rebecca (Mandy Moore) and Jack had a Great Love back in the day, but with the mystery of his death solved, the writers seem more interested in showing us Rebecca as the grieving widow whose kids resent her, or the well-meaning but tactless mother whose grown daughter resents her. Kevin\u2019s (Justin Hartley) big-time war movie, meanwhile, turned out to be a Ron Howard masterpiece\u2026 but Kevin couldn\u2019t enjoy it because Terry Gross immediately bummed him out (unintentionally) by asking him a bunch of questions about Jack\u2019s time in Vietnam that he couldn\u2019t answer. Now he\u2019s neck-deep in guilt research, tracking down Jack\u2019s old war buddies and, possibly, the mystery woman who was wearing Jack\u2019s necklace in the photo. (I can only imagine all the hand-wringing and melodramatic tears when Jack\u2019s secret Vietnam War love child turns the Big Three into the Big Three-Point-Five.) Even NBC\u2019s poster for the show this season (below, far right) seems more depressed than ever.\n\nNBC (3)\n\nTo be fair, the Vietnam story line did inspire this season\u2019s most experimental episode, a reverse-chronological look at the life of Jack\u2019s dead brother Nicky (Michael Angarano). There was a lot to admire about \u201cVietnam\u201d \u2014 like the focus on Nicky\u2019s date of birth, a subtle callback to the Big Three\u2019s 36th-birthday turning points in the pilot. If only the writers trusted themselves \u2014 and viewers \u2014 enough to avoid hand-holding us through the Big Cry moment: As Jack\u2019s friend and fellow soldier Robinson (Mo McRae) lay wounded on the ground, he reached up and cradled Jack\u2019s face with both hands. \u201cJack,\u201d he said, staring his sergeant in the eye. \u201cBreathe.\u201d Every single This is Us fan knew the importance of this gesture \u2014 but rather than giving us the space to feel this emotion on our own, the show felt the need to insert a mid-scene flashback of Jack cradling young Randall\u2019s (Niles Fitch) face the same way, turning what could have been a genuinely tear-inducing sequence into a flashing-neon \u201cCry Now!\u201d command.\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating to see This is Us resort to such ham-handed maneuvers, especially when it can be \u2014 and sometimes still is \u2014 so outstanding. The second episode this season, \u201cThe Philadelphia Story,\u201d featured a masterful juxtaposition of timelines: Young Kate, plowing through Fudge Stripe cookies on the couch, tells her mother, a hint of defiance in her voice, \u201cI gained 25 pounds.\u201d Rebecca\u2019s hesitant reply \u2014 \u201cDon\u2019t be so hard on yourself\u201d \u2014 dovetailed beautifully with the modern-day story line, as she offered to administer Kate\u2019s hormone shot in the bathroom at Kevin\u2019s movie premiere. \u201cI should have done more when you really started gaining the weight,\u201d Rebecca admits sadly. It was a delicate and earned moment of emotion.\n\nIt is not a coincidence that the most likable characters on This is Us are the ones that are consistently allowed to have feelings other than sadness, loss, and regret: Randall (Sterling K. Brown) and Beth (Susan Kelechi Watson). Of course, Randall is earnest to a fault and prone to well up at the slightest hint of sentiment \u2014 but he\u2019s also an adorably dorky father and husband who generally enjoys his life (even when he can\u2019t convince all his daughters to join him for \u201ccelebratory fro-yo\u201d). And every time Randall gets a little too maudlin for his own good, Beth is there to set things right with humor and I\u2019m-over-it clarity. Take this exchange, from last week\u2019s episode:\n\nBeth: \u201cYou\u2019re an emotional man, Randall. You talk about fathers, you cry. You talk about daughters, you cry. You talk about the little round boy on the corner who tried to sell lemonade in the winter\u2026\u201d\n\nRandall: \u201cAll his lemonade froze, Beth.\u201d\n\nAnd now we\u2019re going to have to watch poor Beth struggle with depression after losing her job? \u201cFor the past few weeks, I have been pretending that I\u2019m fine,\u201d she tells Randall in previews for tonight\u2019s episode. \u201cI\u2019m not fine.\u201d Who has two hands and does not want to watch the most grounded and entertaining character on This is Us get sucked in to a vortex of schmaltz? This girl, right here. Of course, a charismatic and highly accomplished superwoman like Beth is allowed to get the blues sometimes \u2014 but my fear is that her angst won\u2019t lead to actual character development, and instead will wind up being another emotional procedural moment. Tears? Check. On to next week.\n\nStill, I\u2019m sticking with This is Us \u2014 fandom, like family, is built on forgiveness, after all. My only hope is that the writers will take the upcoming winter break to remember something Kevin said in season 1: \u201cLife is full of color.\u201d And not all of it is gray.
