Of course, Darcell didn't get partake.\n\nWe're told the pregnancy announcement was a huge success. Darcell's family wasn't at the show but she immediately texted them a video and they \"freaked out,\" naturally.", "images": ["https://theblast.com/assets/facebook_black.svg", "https://theblast.com/assets/logo-primary.svg", "https://theblast.com/assets/flipboard_black.svg", "https://theblast.com/assets/email_black.svg", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/0x0/previous/adf9e91eb8ee6f407aeb55d38dd9887b.jpg", "https://theblast.com/assets/x_black.svg", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2025/04/10103529/favicon-16x16-1.png"], "top_img": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2025/04/10103529/favicon-16x16-1.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/55070/justin-timberlake-concert-fan-announce-pregnancy/", "title": "Justin Timberlake Stops Concert for Epic Pregnancy Announcement", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Timberlake Stops Concert for Epic Pregnancy Announcement", "url": "https://theblast.com/55070/justin-timberlake-concert-fan-announce-pregnancy/", "site_name": "The Blast"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheBlastnews", "published_time": "2018-04-03T03:49:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-03T03:49:00+00:00"}, "author": "TheBlast Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@undefined", "site": "@theblastnews"}, "keywords": "News,Hey Baby,Justin Timberlake,Concerts", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2025/04/10103517/android-chrome-192x192-1.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522727340.0, "source": "https://theblast.com", "summary": ""}
