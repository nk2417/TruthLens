She was 47.\n\n\u201cThe news of her death destroyed our life and we will never be the same,\u201d said her father, John Nesci, in a statement read during Reagan\u2019s sentencing in Torrance Superior Court. \u201cAll of a sudden, in the dark of the night, everything was stolen from her and from all of us.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNesci was an avid body builder whose show followed her life as a tough, hardworking attorney in the Riviera Village. Her young son, Rocco, was featured in several episodes.\n\nA statement written for the sentencing by Robert Nesci, the victim\u2019s brother, described a troubled relationship between the couple \u2014 one that Nesci was allegedly preparing to leave.\n\n\u201cShe wasted years of her life, gifted you with so much money, and foolishly believed in your stories,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReagan was \u201cdistraught\u201d when he called police to the home in 2015 to report an emergency, said Redondo police Sgt. Fabian Saucedo.\n\n\u201cIt was kind of weird actually. He didn\u2019t say anything. It\u2019s one of those things we call an unknown trouble call,\u201d Saucedo said at the time. \u201cIt was very vague, like, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019\u201d\n\nPolice automatically respond to 911 calls, so they drove by Nesci\u2019s home \u2014 where Reagan waited outside, Saucedo said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe gave them details of what may have occurred, and as a result, [the officers] decided they better go in and check the welfare. That\u2019s where they found the body,\u201d Saucedo said at the time. \u201cObviously it was some kind of domestic dispute; otherwise, it wouldn\u2019t have led to this.\u201d\n\nAfter police discovered Nesci\u2019s body, Reagan was arrested.\n\nHis defense attorney contended in court that the stabbing was in self-defense and that Nesci fell on the knife during a struggle.\n\nAn autopsy revealed that Nesci was stabbed at least four times in the abdomen between her breasts and belly button. Reagan waited more than five hours after the stabbing to call police, contacting an attorney first.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA native of Connecticut, Nesci joined the Los Angeles Police Department in 1996 and worked as a patrol officer in the Southwest Division, according to a biography on her website. An LAPD spokeswoman declined to confirm that Nesci was a former employee, citing privacy issues.\n\nNesci said she was among the officers present during the North Hollywood shootout in 1997.\n\nHer career with the LAPD was brief. She left the department in 1998 and enrolled in law school at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn. In 2004, she returned to California and melded her legal career with pursuits in entertainment and media, including hosting a radio show on KCAA-AM (1050).\n\nesmeralda.bermudez@latimes.com\n\n@LATBermudez", "images": ["https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9eee71d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4486x3000+7+0/resize/320x214!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffc%2F4c%2F974f11404aaeafeff655c366b606%2Fla24-crimesofthetimes-9000x6000px.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/cc63765/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4500x3000+0+40/resize/840x560!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F61%2Faa%2F13d176ed47f2b6fa724bd144344b%2Fla-me-pesticides-child-farmworkers-01.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/481824d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/598x400+4+0/resize/320x214!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F57%2Fe2%2Ff48081114ea0bdeefc67498243ed%2Fla25-lacrimes-podcast-3x2.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1283b81/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6656x4437+768+0/resize/840x560!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F5d%2Fe2%2Fc0c3770043c6b0241e84cc5b3798%2F1530828-me-1118-laweather-baldwin-park-gem-005.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1c2e186/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2688+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2F6d%2F592853d14fbc82398535ee36c9e8%2Fcalifornia-political-aide-indicted-53161.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/a6/d6/eea0f1094fb281dbea09e0aa79cd/art-caltimes-trademark-3x.png", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6908a9a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3645x2430+1+0/resize/840x560!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F61%2F5e%2F992716bf43c8bd5940bb03581776%2Ftrump-47468.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/844e755/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x2000+0+15/resize/840x560!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc6%2Fec%2Fd2c43a0a4282a304c30e10166ffd%2F1496533-me-calabasas-landfill-protest-11-mjc.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1783c07/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5205x3470+0+80/resize/840x560!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F8a%2F93%2F3de941034756aaf72ca843141d00%2F1531023-me-ucla-file-images-02-mjc.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dcdebfd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1152x1152+448+0/resize/130x130!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Faa%2F06%2F15bf5e1be33c3661d2365ff582bb%2Fimg-57e59ffd-turbine-la-bio-esmeralda-bermudez", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3d9f3bb/2147483647/strip/true/crop/359x240+1+0/resize/320x214!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7c%2F40%2F89ed286f48bf867830f3e5780504%2Fla25-rebuildingla-180x120.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d7c8130/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2991x2000+5+0/resize/320x214!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fca%2F9a%2F467132654396b36ff59a62d8c8b4%2Fhairdresser-killed-85454.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/64e287b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F57d858144a2a88575fa2b03080bb%2Flatlogo-ss.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/8a7ffd3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2991x2000+5+0/resize/320x214!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F14%2F97%2F2dd8a46b4894bdbd89b9a75d5e10%2Fhairdresser-killed-44120.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ed00b1f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3744x2496+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb5%2F7f%2Fdf3a9a3649318f6189515127008c%2F1505425-me-real-id-airports-28.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/a13b728/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5270x3513+226+0/resize/840x560!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F33%2Fd7%2F824ccfd64373b18381d305da704b%2F1531130-me-alhambra-officer-killed01-rb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/64e287b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2400x1260+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fdf%2F45%2F57d858144a2a88575fa2b03080bb%2Flatlogo-ss.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Esmeralda Bermudez Writes Narrative Stories About The Lives Of Latinos For The Los Angeles Times.
