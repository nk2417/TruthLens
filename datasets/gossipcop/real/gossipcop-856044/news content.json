As one would imagine, the latter is the preferred property for celebrities and honeymooners, though newlyweds who prefer a cozier accommodation opt for a one-bedroom villa.\n\nEach one-bedroom villa includes a cozy sitting room, a media room, and a walk-through dressing area that opens onto an adjoining bedroom with a king-size bed. The rooms are decorated in neutral beige tones and accented with woven grass mats for a rustic, natural feel, which is carried through the rest of the resort. Each villa also comes complete with an outdoor bathtub and a wooden deck leading to a 107-square-foot private stone plunge pool overlooking a lagoon and surrounded by an abundance of pandanus, miki miki, and coconut trees.\n\nA villa at The Brando, complete with a private plunge pool.

And in keeping with The Brando\u2019s ethos of eco-friendly, post-carbon living, all ingredients are sourced from the resort\u2019s own gardens and orchards, and include the region\u2019s fruits and vegetables: mangoes, papayas, tomatoes, squash, avocados, green beans, and breadfruit.\n\nMiddleton and Matthews, both known for their athleticism, whether on the slopes or tennis courts, won't be lacking for activities to occupy their time. The Brando offers a number of options, including snorkeling, paddleboarding, and diving as part of its efforts to introduce guests to the beauty of the island.\n\nMiddleton and Matthews tied the knot at St. Mark\u2019s Church in Englefield, Berkshire, on Saturday, with a reception under a custom-built glass marquee on the Middleton family\u2019s grounds.", "images":
