Watt's fund for Hurricane Harvey victims in Houston raised more than $37 million before it was closed Friday at the request of the NFL star, according to YouCaring, the company that handled the online donations.\n\n\"If there is one thing that I have taken away from these last few weeks, it is the reassurance of how much good is out there in our world,'' wrote Watt, an All-Pro defensive end for the Houston Texans, in a message on his fund's page at YouCaring.com. \"When times are the toughest, humanity stands at its strongest and you have all helped to prove that emphatically.''\n\nWhen the fund closed at 6 p.m. ET Friday, Watt wrote, efforts would shift from fundraising to ensuring the money is put to work for the people in the devastated areas in and around Houston.\n\nWatt started the online campaign Aug. 28 with a donation of a $100,000 and a goal of raising $200,000. More than 200,000 people donated, most at less than $100 apiece.\n\n\"There are many places you could have donated your hard-earned money and I\u2019m honored you have chosen to join this effort to support the people who were affected most by Hurricane Harvey,'' he wrote. \"Please keep this spirit of helping one another alive. The world is a better place when we all take care of each other.\"", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/9d85d0430c2ebf91102fb2b5311252ee50ba77ed/c=0-400-3899-2603/local/-/media/2017/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636410999013236481-USATSI-10271845.jpg?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gciaf/prod/p?a=pageview&p=USAT-TEALIUM-TANGENT&m=web&k=f14ebdd6-0569-4c64-af73-99937bc06379&s=noscript", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/a020845da15ae9eacd1debbf816517e39a8772b8/c=66-44-553-531/local/-/media/2019/01/10/USATODAY/USATODAY/636827364294878515-JoshPeter.png?width=48&height=48&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/9d85d0430c2ebf91102fb2b5311252ee50ba77ed/c=0-400-3899-2603/local/-/media/2017/09/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636410999013236481-USATSI-10271845.jpg?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/texans/2017/09/15/jj-watt-hurricane-harvey-relief-fund-ends/672397001/", "title": "J.J.
