{"url": "https://now100fm.com/katy-perry-mean-american-idol-says/", "text": "Katy Perry is judging on the new American Idol alongside Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan, but she says that she can\u2019t be the mean judge like Simon Cowell. Why does she say that? Well, \u201cI\u2019m blunt, but I can\u2019t be mean \u2019cause I\u2019m a woman,\u201d Katy says.\n\nShe said that with a sort of joke tone in her voice, but Katy has been described as \u201cnot mean, but she\u2019s brutally honest.\u201d To be totally honest though, Simon Cowell wasn\u2019t really mean either \u2013 he was brutally honest. Katy later added that nobody can be \u201cthe new Simon\u201d because Simon was an executive in the music industry \u2013 the current judges are all performers. They aren\u2019t producers or executives.\n\nKaty went on to say \u201cI love Simon, he\u2019s my favorite judge. I think we all have our expertise. Luke can speak on a lot more country things, Lionel can speak on everything because he\u2019s a legend, I have my pop lane\u2026 I think we all bring strengths.\u201d They do have a good variety of judges, but I still feel like there should be an executive or producer from somewhere in the music industry there. I guess the problem is that most executives or producers are too \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d and not really recognisable characters. There must be a reason why they went the route they did. Either way, the show starts up pretty soon, March 11th. Will you watch the new show?\n\nSource.", "images": ["https://cdn.bonneville.cloud/i/KZZO-FM/custom.png", "https://cdn.bonneville.com/bonneville/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/01/GettyImages-902742024.jpg", "https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_generic_rgb_wo_45.png", "https://devimages-cdn.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/images/badge-download-on-the-app-store.svg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.bonneville.com/bonneville/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/01/GettyImages-902742024.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://now100fm.com/katy-perry-mean-american-idol-says/", "title": "Katy Perry Can\u2019t Be Mean On \u2018American Idol,\u2019 She Says", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Katy Perry was thought to be 'the new Simon' for American Idol, but she gave one reason to why she can't be the 'mean' judge.", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Katy Perry Can't Be Mean On 'American Idol,' She Says", "description": "Katy Perry was thought to be 'the new Simon' for American Idol, but she gave one reason to why she can't be the 'mean' judge.", "url": "https://now100fm.com/katy-perry-mean-american-idol-says/", "site_name": "Now 100.5 FM", "updated_time": "2018-03-20T13:56:31-07:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.bonneville.com/bonneville/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/01/GettyImages-902742024.jpg", "secure_url": "https://cdn.bonneville.com/bonneville/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/01/GettyImages-902742024.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 887, "alt": "katy perry", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"tag": "Simon Cowell", "section": "Celebrities"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Katy Perry Can't Be Mean On 'American Idol,' She Says", "description": "Katy Perry was thought to be 'the new Simon' for American Idol, but she gave one reason to why she can't be the 'mean' judge.", "image": "https://cdn.bonneville.com/bonneville/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/01/GettyImages-902742024.jpg", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "nowproducerdave", "label2": "Time to read", "data2": "1 minute"}, "tec-api-version": "v1", "tec-api-origin": "https://now100fm.com", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.bonneville.com/bonneville/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2020/04/cropped-kzzo_logo_square-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://now100fm.com", "summary": ""}
