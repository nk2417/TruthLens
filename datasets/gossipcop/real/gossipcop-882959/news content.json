Rashida Jones and Pat Rosnick are writing the 20th Century Fox film.\n\nThe buzz about a potential sequel grew after the 2017 Emmys in September, when the three co-stars appeared on stage together. At the time, Fonda recalled that in the film, they had a \"sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical\" boss. The ladies seemed to allude to Mr. Trump when Tomlin responded, \"We still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying, hypocritical bigot.\"\n\nIn March, Parton said she and her co-stars got their ducks in a row because of the recent conversation around gender inequality.\n\n\"All these years we've talked about doing a sequel to '9 to 5,' but it never made any real sense,\" Parton said. \"Until just recently [with] all the equal work for equal pay and all the harassment in the workplace [backlash] \u2013 we decided that we are going to try to do another one.\"\n\nShe also revealed, \"This new idea [is] going to bring some new girls in ... and they're gonna find us, the old characters. We've all come up with a business of our own. So, they come to find us just to get some input.\"", "images":
