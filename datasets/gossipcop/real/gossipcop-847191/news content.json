Typos, nipples \u2014 the internet has seen it all! Click through to relive celebs\u2019 biggest social media fails, from Scott Disick to Kim Kardashian and more\n\nDuring an Instagram Live session on Saturday, April 29, the \u201cBon App\u00e9tit\u201d singer read a series of fan questions aloud. \u201cOh, someone says, \u2018I miss your old black hair,'\u201d she said before sarcastically replying, \u201cOh, really? Do you miss Barack Obama as well? Oh, OK. Times change. Bye! See you guys later.\u201d\n\nPerry then started laughing and turned around to look at her friends, seemingly searching for their approval. \u201cI should leave now,\u201d she said, still giggling. An off-camera pal could be heard replying, \u201cOK, you\u2019re cut off,\u201d as Perry ended the livestream.\n\nRelated: Celebs Fight Back on Twitter!

The reference to former Pres. Obama was offensive & a poor, tasteless attempt at humor. Your privilege is showing,\u201d one user tweeted.\n\nAnother critic wrote, \u201cSometimes when I think that the world is an awful place, I remember that Barack Obama has more Grammys than Katy Perry, and I feel better.\u201d (Obama has two Grammys for his audiobooks Dreams From My Father and The Audacity of Hope; Perry has been nominated for 13 Grammys, but hasn\u2019t won.)\n\nRelated: Katy Perry\u2019s Video Looks Take a look back at Katy Perry's most memorable music video looks from her iconic onscreen tales\n\nPerry previously came under fire in February when she made an insensitive joke about Britney Spears\u2018 mental health and infamous head-shaving incident. During a red carpet interview at the 2017 Grammys, Perry was asked about her brief hiatus from music. \u201cIt\u2019s called taking care of your mental health,\u201d she replied. \u201cI haven\u2019t shaved my head yet.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cTeenage Dream\u201d singer has yet to publicly address her controversial Obama joke.
