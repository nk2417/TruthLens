Romantic, clever, and wise in a way the show hadn\u2019t yet been, Season 3 introduces us to the second love of Carrie\u2019s life, the much-mourned Aidan Shaw. Not one to let a good thing last too long, Carrie risks her steady, enriching relationship with Aidan to enter into an affair with Big, a series of episodes that gives the show its first true stabs of darkness. Parker is fantastic in this thoroughly compelling storyline, turning our beloved Carrie into someone who\u2019s almost detestable, but pulling her back just before she crosses into true villainy. (And, not for nothing, her just slightly disheveled Jackie O-esque trench coat and aviator glasses look in one episode is maybe the best she ever had.) Elsewhere, Miranda and Steve\u2019s relationship explores credible topics of everyday intimacy, while Samantha begins to struggle with age and just the faintest hint of loneliness. And, best of all, Season 3 is when we first meet the show\u2019s wonderful, bun-wearing fairy godmother, Magda.\n\nWhat\u2019s Not: I know lots of people prize this as the show\u2019s best season, but here\u2019s why I\u2019m only putting it in the middle. First off, the icky, seemingly never-ending Trey arc begins in Season 3, marking Charlotte\u2019s rapid tumble into fastidious psychopathy. After Season 3, Charlotte is never fully human again. Which is a shame, because Kristin Davis is a good actress who deserved more. As did Samantha. Though some effort is made to round out her character, the show had become enough of a hit that the writers started giving poor Kim Cattrall groaner after groaner of punny innuendo (not to mention the increasingly goofy sexcapades). At least the show was too classy to give her a catchphrase. And, it should be said, from today's perspective, every time Sam says the word \u201ctranny\u201d it lands with an uncomfortable thud. Two episodes that bring the girls to Los Angeles are largely wastes of time that rely way too heavily on an overstated New York vs. L.A. dichotomy. And Season 3 also sees the debut of Mario Cantone\u2019s wretched Anthony, the most appalling recurring character of the show\u2019s run. But the real problem with Season 3, and please don\u2019t tar and feather me for saying this, is that Aidan is just such a dweeb. In all his laid-back doofus-ness, he is so clearly a wrong fit for Carrie that it\u2019s hard to root for him at all in the season\u2019s centerpiece love triangle. I know that to many, Aidan represents the nice guy that Carrie should have ended up with, but knowing what lies ahead for Carrie, it\u2019s plain to see when re-watching Season 3 that he\u2019s just too easy for our frazzled, wild heroine.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5307a9aff9a60fb55e000076/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/1393011126257_satc-anniversary-seasons-05.jpg",
