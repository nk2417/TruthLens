The talented actress took to Instagram on May 27 to post an adorable family photo of herself with husband, Michael Douglas, 73, and their son, Dylan, 17, who was all dressed up to go to his senior prom! \u201cProm Proud!\u201d Catherine captioned the snapshot. \u201cGraduation around the corner! So proud of you Dylan. College bound! Love you so.\u201d Aw! In the close-up pic, Catherine and Michael can be seen with big smiles on their faces as an equally happy Dylan stands next to them in a classic black and white tuxedo. In addition to the family pic, Catherine posted a pic of just Dylan looking dashing while running his fingers through his hair.\n\nThe photos appear to have been taken during pre-prom festivities at the Douglas house and in another pic that was posted to Instagram, Dylan can be seen with his date, a gorgeous brunette. The special occasion seemed to go over well and proved that after 18 years of marriage, Catherine and Michael still have a close bond. In addition to Dylan, the loving couple share a daughter, Carys, who is 15, and Michael has a son, Cameron, 39, from his previous marriage.\n\nMichael and Cameron recently made headlines when Cameron opened up about his rough past that included drug addiction and some prison time. He credited his family, including Michael and stepmother Catherine, for encouraging him to get through it and never giving up on him. \u201cCatherine is a scrapper, she\u2019s someone who came from Wales and clawed her way up to the very top through sheer talent and determination,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cShe never gives up on anything and she didn\u2019t quit on me. The love of my family got me through my darkest days.\u201d", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/catherine-zeta-jones-48-michael-douglas-send-handsome-look-alike-son-17-off-to-prom-see-his-pic-with-date-ftr.jpg?resize=384%2C216", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/catherine-zeta-jones-48-michael-douglas-send-handsome-look-alike-son-17-off-to-prom-see-his-pic-with-date-post.jpg?resize=620%2C624", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/catherine-zeta-jones-48-michael-douglas-send-handsome-look-alike-son-17-off-to-prom-see-his-pic-with-date-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C350"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/catherine-zeta-jones-48-michael-douglas-send-handsome-look-alike-son-17-off-to-prom-see-his-pic-with-date-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C350", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Silvia", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/28/catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-son-dylan-prom-photo-pic/", "title": "Catherine Zeta Jones, 48, & Michael Douglas Send Handsome Look-Alike Son, 17, Off To Prom", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas show off lookalike son in prom pic", "google-site-verification": "Atm19DlLsEdntyQvdD3b8sMiONm67k-Es2Ds9GrBCvU", "news_keywords": "Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Douglas", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "amp-consent-blocking": "amp-ad,amp-iframe", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.4.7", "auto-social": "always", "author": "Erin Silvia", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Catherine Zeta Jones, 48, & Michael Douglas Send Handsome Look-Alike Son, 17, Off To Prom", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/28/catherine-zeta-jones-michael-douglas-son-dylan-prom-photo-pic/", "description": "Catherine Zeta-Jones took to Instagram on May 27 to proudly show off a happy pic of her son, Dylan, along with hubby Michael Douglas, as the teen was excitingly getting ready to attend his senior p\u2026", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/catherine-zeta-jones-48-michael-douglas-send-handsome-look-alike-son-17-off-to-prom-see-his-pic-with-date-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C350", "width": 620, "height": 350, "alt": "Catherine Zeta-Jones, Michael Douglas, Dylan Douglas"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-28T16:24:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-12-09T07:53:36+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Catherine Zeta Jones, 48, & Michael Douglas Send Handsome Look-Alike Son, 17, Off To Prom", "description": "Catherine Zeta-Jones and Michael Douglas show off lookalike son in prom pic", "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/catherine-zeta-jones-48-michael-douglas-send-handsome-look-alike-son-17-off-to-prom-see-his-pic-with-date-ftr.jpg?fit=620%2C350"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cropped-hlicon_COLOR.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527480000.0, "source": "https://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
