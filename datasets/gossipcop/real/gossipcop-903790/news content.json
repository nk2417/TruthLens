Khloe also revealed on Jimmy Kimmel's chat show last night that both 26 year-old Thomas and the KUWTK crew knew before the Jenner Kardashian family, 'I've known the crew since 2007. We've had pretty much the same. They've been involved in pretty much the best and worst of us and they keep quiet.'\n\nRead Next\n\nAfter hearing the news, her siblings provided her with plenty of 'unwanted' advice.\n\n'Kourtney gives a lot of advice. I think it's so sweet, but I don't want to do some of that stuff,' she said.\n\nKourtney is know for her natural-lead mothering, which includes avoiding TV's and processed foods, for her three children with Scott Disick. Khloe went onto explain, 'If someone buys blocks, I'm allowed to have blocks! Let me experience things. It's either her way or no way. It's not what you say, it's how you say it.'\n\n'We've been fighting a lot lately and we never fight,' Khloe said, 'She got p***ed because I wanted to put a TV in the nursery. ...I'm the worst person for ever wanting a TV.'\n\nYesterday the six month pregnant designer also popped by Ellen DeGeneres' show to spill further beans. She told the comedian why she announced her pregnancy on Instagram and also what her name ideas are for her newborn. She explained, 'I think, if it's a boy I'll go with\u2026 Tristan Jr. , and then for a girl I don't even know where to begin \u2026I think I want a K or a T.'\n\nThat's right, a continuation of the K dynasty. We wouldn't expect anything less.\n\nRelated Story Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian on Why She Took So Long to Confir\n\nRelated Story The Kardashians Pressured Khlo\u00e9 to Lose Weight", "images":
