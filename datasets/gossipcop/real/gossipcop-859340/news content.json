{"url": "https://people.com/tv/bethenny-frankel-ramona-singer-friendship-status-rhony/", "text": "Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer\u2018s feud fueled most of the action in season 9 of The Real Housewives of New York City \u2014 stemming from the moment Singer made the mistake of bringing up Frankel\u2019s naked film past in the context of her 7-year-old daughter Bryn.\n\nFrom there, it was one fight after the next \u2014 each time Singer attempting to apologize only to dig a deeper and deeper hole for herself by insulting Frankel again and again.\n\nFirst there was a chat in a restaurant during a group holiday party, where Singer attempted a more polite approach but got vicious when Frankel calmly told her \u201cI don\u2019t want to be schooled by you right now and I don\u2019t like the way you\u2019re speaking to me.\u201d Then there was Singer\u2019s Berkshires blowout \u2014 where she criticized everything from Frankel\u2019s Skinnygirl empire to her relationship status to the real way she allegedly made her millions (sample: \u201cYou didn\u2019t have any money until you f\u2014\u2013. You would date every guy for their f\u2014\u2014 money\u201d).\n\nIt only got worse when Frankel disinvited Singer from a group vacation \u2014 causing Singer to launch into an emotional tirade about her divorce. \u201cMy f\u2014\u2014 heart was cut out, my legs, my arms,\u201d Singer said, tearing up. \u201cSo don\u2019t even tell me and try to compare your life to mine. Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t. Just don\u2019t, Bethenny. Have more respect for me. Have more respect and more sympathy. It\u2019s not always about you.\u201d\n\nBravo\n\nBravo\n\nEventually the two would make a pact to drop the nasty comments. And during a tequila-filled trip to Mexico, the two would come to peace \u2014 having a heart-to-heart on pool floats while the Skinnygirl mogul skinny-dipped.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m f\u2014ed up, okay? I\u2019m f\u2014ed up,\u201d Singer said. \u201cI\u2019m a miserable person, I\u2019m horrible, I\u2019m a bad friend, I don\u2019t know how to act. I am so sorry that I did what I did and I hurt you. I\u2019ll never do that again. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to be that person. I care about you and I don\u2019t want to hurt you or anyone else I care about.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat s\u2014 has to stop. You be a good friend. Who does that? Who acts like that?\u201d Frankel told her in response. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to be that person. I know you don\u2019t know. You\u2019re not bad \u2014 you\u2019re not an evil person. \u2026 I want you to be happy. I really do, I swear to God on my life I want you to be happy.\u201d\n\nBravo\n\nSo where does Frankel and Singer\u2019s friendship stand now?\n\nOn Wednesday\u2019s reunion part three, the two once again revisited their season-long battle. And after exchanging another round of blows, they appeared to settle back into a truce \u2014 even hugging at the end.\n\n\u201cThe thing was all season, I just wanted you to be out of my way,\u201d Frankel told Singer. \u201cI\u2019m not angry at you \u2014 I knew you had such anxiety coming in here. I don\u2019t feel anger towards you. But do I need to be your best friend? No.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be close, but I don\u2019t not not like you is where I am with you,\u201d she said, quoting Singer\u2019s iconic \u201cI don\u2019t not not like you\u201d from earlier in the season. \u201cI\u2019m not angry with you, I honestly wish you happiness.\u201d\n\nHer words resonated with Singer. \u201cI feel it from you. I\u2019m honestly happy we\u2019re in this place. I really feel better,\u201d she said, as host Andy Cohen pointed out the two weren\u2019t in that good of a place. \u201cAt least [Bethenny\u2019s] talking to me. She\u2019s not icing me out. So for me, that\u2019s good!\u201d\n\nBravo\n\nSinger spent a lot of time Wednesday apologizing for her actions \u2014 even admitting that she \u201ccringed\u201d when she watched back some of her arguments with the upcoming Shark Tank investor.\n\n\u201cIt was blind range,\u201d she said of her behavior in the Berkshires. \u201cI was so angry, it was blind range.\u201d\n\nShe was also blind drunk too. \u201cI had a few too many,\u201d Singer admitted, balking down questions from Cohen that she was also on pills. \u201cI wasn\u2019t on pills, I was just drinking all day because being around her was making me nervous. I don\u2019t take Xanax.\u201d\n\n\u201cLooking back, I looked like an a\u2014\u2014. I don\u2019t know what I was thinking the whole damn season,\u201d Singer added. \u201cI just lost my whole mojo for weeks on end because Bethenny was so upset with me \u2014 which I can understand in retrospect. But I just didn\u2019t know how to make it right and it just got worse. And it was just a horrible moment in my life.\u201d\n\nBravo\n\nStill, despite \u201cowning\u201d her bad behavior, Singer remained steadfast that her original question about Frankel\u2019s naked-film past was innocent.\n\n\u201cMy delivery sucked at that lunch. [But] it was not coming out of viciousness, it was not coming out of maliciousness,\u201d Singer said, explaining that she had been sent the article from a friend a week before talking with Frankel about it.\n\n\u201cMy first concern in the back of my head was remembering that [former New York City Housewife] Alex McCord had a naked picture in one of the weeklies [in season 1],\u201d Singer recalled. \u201cAnd [my daughter Avery\u2019s] school was upset, she was almost asked to leave. \u2026 I was like, \u2018Oh my God, I hope everything\u2019s okay with Bryn. I hope no one\u2019s saying anything.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBravo\n\nFROM PEN: Andy Cohen\u2019s Pick For The Most Absurd Real Housewives\u2019 Business Ever\n\nFrankel didn\u2019t buy it. \u201cThe article brought up something that had already been in the press years ago and I wrote in a book had come out six weeks before,\u201d she told Singer. \u201cSo when you came to that very intimate time to speak to me mother-to-mother in a very public restaurant and bring me this smoking gun, it wasn\u2019t that it was the delivery. It was the content, it was the intention \u2014 it was malicious.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was going through a bad situation in my personal life and despite that, I didn\u2019t come at you at all,\u201d Frankel continued, looking back at their season of blows. \u201cNot one time did I attack you. You attacked my entire career and insinuated I slept my way to I don\u2019t know where, but I never attacked you not one time, Ramona. \u2026You\u2019ve been disgusting to me.\u201d\n\nRHONY REWIND: Bethenny Frankel and Ramona Singer Fight on the Brooklyn Bridge\n\n\n\nThe two continued to go back and forth \u2014 Frankel bringing up past arguments (the Brooklyn Bridge!) and Singer maintaining that she was always a good friend (\u201cI\u2019ve been so there for you on so many levels\u201d).\n\nBut in the end, none of that mattered as the two decided to put down their (metaphorical) guns and focus on moving on.\n\n\u2018Til next season \u2026", "images":
