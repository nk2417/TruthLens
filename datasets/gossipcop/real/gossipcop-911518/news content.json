Abrams-produced movie heretofore known as God Particle would forgo a theatrical release and instead debut on the streaming service immediately following the big game on Sunday.\n\nThe marketing stunt capped a rescue plan hatched by Abrams, Paramount chairman-CEO Jim Gianopulos, Netflix chief Ted Sarandos and head of original films Scott Stuber, among others.\n\nWorried that Cloverfield Paradox would perish at the box office \u2014 it was set to hit theaters April 20 after several delays \u2014 Paramount and Abrams handed it to Netflix, which is willing to shell out big bucks for high-profile content.\n\nThe deal, broached over the holidays and finalized in January, is worth north of $50 million, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter, with Paramount retaining rights for China and home entertainment.\n\nIt makes the movie instantly profitable for the studio, which avoids a (likely) misfire and costly marketing campaign. And Netflix got what it was looking for, regardless of withering reviews (18 percent on Rotten Tomatoes at press time): buzz.\n\n\u201cIt gets them attention and captures some viewing right off the bat,\u201d says eMarketer\u2019s Paul Verna. And even if the streamer doesn\u2019t ultimately get the viewership it hoped for Paradox, \u201cthey still got a brand jolt,\u201d he adds.\n\nCloverfield Paradox, which finished principal photography in September 2016, was part of the successful and popular Cloverfield series, but sources say Gianopulos, who joined Paramount six months later, was worried.\n\nDespite additions to clarify character beats and tie the film to the franchise\u2019s universe, it was ultimately deemed unsalvageable, even with a cast led by Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Elizabeth Debicki, David Oyelowo and Daniel Bruhl.\n\nNetflix was an obvious destination, having already taken over international rights to the Natalie Portman starrer Annihilation, which Paramount will release domestically Feb. 23.\n\nParamount retains the rights to future Cloverfield installments. Overlord, a World War II zombie film from Abrams that scored high in two recent test screenings, could be a contender, although sources say that its fate is still undetermined.\n\nThis story first appeared in the Feb. 7 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
