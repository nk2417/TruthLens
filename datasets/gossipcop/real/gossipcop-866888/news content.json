Impact Link\n\nThese two are just friends. MTV The INSIDER Summary:\n\nTom Holland and Zendaya are costars in \"Spider-Man: Homecoming.\"\n\nPeople published a report that the two were dating in real life.\n\nThey both took to social media to shut the rumors down.\n\nThe two are just friends.\n\n\n\nZendaya and Tom Holland can't seem to escape the romance rumors, but these \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" stars are not dating.\n\nPeople magazine published a report Thursday evening citing a source who told them that the potential couple started dating while filming the newest Marvel movie.\n\n\u201cThey started seeing each other while they were filming 'Spider-Man,'\" said the magazine's source.\"They\u2019ve been super careful to keep it private and out of the public eye but they\u2019ve gone on vacations with each other and try and spend as much time as possible with one another.\"\n\nZendaya, 20, who plays Michelle in the movie, responded to the rumors on Twitter and shut them down.\n\n\"Wait wait...my favorite is when it says we go on vacations together HA! I haven't been on vacation in years! hbu [how about you] @TomHolland1996?\" she tweeted.\n\nHolland, 21, who plays Spider-Man, responded with some laughing emojis and joked, \"Does the press tour count?\"\n\nZendaya's final tweet on the romance rumors was, \"I'm done,\" with a crying/laughing emoji and raised hand emoji.\n\nThat settles the question of romantic involvement, but it won't stop people from wanting it to be true.\n\n(Note: Minor spoilers for \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" are below.)\n\nIt's unclear whether the two characters will become romantically involved in future movies. Zendaya's character, Michelle, revealed at the end of the film that her nickname is MJ. The moniker is used as the nickname for Mary Jane, Spider-Man's love interest in the comics, so it could happen. Though, it is safe to say after their responses that these two are just friends in real life.", "images": ["https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5968ce139d09180cb162d471?width=1010&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5968ce139d09180cb162d471?width=1010&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anjelica Oswald"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/are-spider-man-costars-zendaya-tom-holland-dating-2017-7", "title": "'Spider-Man' stars Zendaya and Tom Holland shut down reports that they're dating in real life", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "'Spider-Man' stars Zendaya and Tom Holland shut down reports that they're dating in real life", "datePublished": "2017-07-14T13:58:12.000Z", "dateModified": "2017-07-14T13:58:25.000Z", "news_keywords": "News, Movies, Culture", "description": "The stars of the new Marvel movie may be heating up the screen, but they had to address reports of a romance offscreen.", "author": "Anjelica Oswald", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "tbi-vertical": "News", "og": {"title": "'Spider-Man' stars Zendaya and Tom Holland shut down reports that they're dating in real life", "description": "The stars of the new Marvel movie may be heating up the screen, but they had to address reports of a romance offscreen.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/are-spider-man-costars-zendaya-tom-holland-dating-2017-7", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/5968ce139d09180cb162d471?width=1010&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1010, "height": 505}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@businessinsider"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"psvp": "c"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "5968ce139d09180cb162d473", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"sections": "News", "tags": "Page Type:story"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2025-05", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
