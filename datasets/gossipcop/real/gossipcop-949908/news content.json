News reports, Prince William was surprisingly candid about the role his mother would play in his children\u2019s lives if she were still around.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019d be a nightmare grandmother, absolute nightmare.\u201d\n\nThere is no doubt, he said, that she would love her grandchildren to the Moon and back. But William also said that she would spoil them rotten, much like your own grandmother likely did to you.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019d come in probably at bath time, cause an amazing\u2026 scene, bubbles everywhere, bathwater all over the place, and then leave.\u201d\n\nIt may sound just like the normal parent/grandparent relationship to your ears. But coming from the Royal Family, that type of thing is borderline shocking.\n\nBack when Prince William and Prince Harry were young boys, Princess Diana\u2019s parenting style was hands-on to an almost shocking degree. Sure, she had nannies to do the \u201cheavy lifting,\u201d such as changing dirty diapers and such. But her level of involvement with her sons was leaps and bounds more direct than that of any other Royal in history.\n\nIT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRINCESS DIANA\u2019S 57TH BIRTHDAY TODAY Today would have been Princess Diana\u2019s 57th birthday. It is 21 years since she passed away but her legacy lives on through her boys Prince William and Prince Harry.

She took them to theme parks. She involved them in her personal causes. She let them wear jeans and baseball caps and eat at McDonald\u2019s.\n\nThat type of hands-on parenting, typical for just about every last parent in the Kingdom but unheard-of for Royals, is now being practiced by William and Kate. Kate, for example, has been known to sit and supervise her children herself while her husband is here or there, doing royal duties. And of course, though she, too, has a team of nannies at her disposal, she\u2019s been known to do much of the heavy lifting herself.\n\nFor William, it\u2019s all about balance. His oldest son, Prince George, will almost certainly be the King of England someday, and there is no escaping that.\n\nThat means that George and his siblings won\u2019t be able to avoid much of the trappings of royalty. For example, George\u2019s younger brother, Louis, was baptized wearing a replica satin-and-lace gown that mirrored the one worn by Queen Victoria\u2019s eldest daughter back in 1841.\n\nAn unnamed Royal source says that William and Kate are trying to find the perfect balance between keeping them connected to their centuries-old royal heritage, and as much of a \u201cnormal\u201d life as possible.", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2421769f-57a4-4bff-913f-cf316747493e.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20157'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20492%20142'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo-white.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/30e5371a8e76379aa12e45266824fecb?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent-Dark-Mode.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20120%20120'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/princess-diana-is-helping-prince-william-and-kate-middleton-raise-their-children", "title": "Princess Diana Is \u2018Helping\u2019 Prince William And Kate Middleton Raise Their Children", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.png", "description": "Princess Diana is \u201chelping\u201d Prince William and Kate Middleton raise their children \u2013 and here \u201chelping\u201d means \u201cher parenting style informs William and Kate\u2019s", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Princess Diana Is \u2018Helping\u2019 Prince William And Kate Middleton Raise Their Children - Inquisitr News", "description": "Princess Diana is \u201chelping\u201d Prince William and Kate Middleton raise their children \u2013 and here \u201chelping\u201d means \u201cher parenting style informs William and Kate\u2019s", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/princess-diana-is-helping-prince-william-and-kate-middleton-raise-their-children", "site_name": "Inquisitr News"}, "article": {"tag": "royal family", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-07-09T11:50:00-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Princess Diana Is \u2018Helping\u2019 Prince William And Kate Middleton Raise Their Children - Inquisitr News", "description": "Princess Diana is \u201chelping\u201d Prince William and Kate Middleton raise their children \u2013 and here \u201chelping\u201d means \u201cher parenting style informs William and Kate\u2019s", "site": "@theinquisitr", "creator": "@theinquisitr"}, "generator": "WP Rocket 3.18.3"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531151400.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
