In my opinion its just a fun movie filled with good jokes and a surprisingly great chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Zac Efron. Definitively worth a watch if you are looking too have a laugh. Rated 4/5 Stars \u2022 Rated 4 out of 5 stars 09/29/25 Full Review Chuck M Laughed my ass off. Jokes are golden. I was very hesitant to see this and it took over 8 yrs to watch it and I'm glad I did. Anyone who says it's terrible clearly doesn't Like entertainment.

Rated 3.5/5 Stars \u2022 Rated 3.5 out of 5 stars 09/11/25 Full Review Russell H Lots of immature humor. Not much else Rated 3.5/5 Stars \u2022 Rated 3.5 out of 5 stars 08/26/25 Full Review Raymond C Baywatch is dumb, poorly written and features bad characters. It's not very funny either and at times it looks really cheap. It's watchable thanks to the cast but overall not very good.
