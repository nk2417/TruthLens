In her accompanying interview with the magazine, she gets candid on the \"very scary\" parts of shooting the movie that made her a household name.\n\n\"Fundamentally, I'm open and warm,\" says Johnson, who reprises her role as Anastasia Steele in the latest movie, Fifty Shades Freed, out Feb. 9. \"At my core, I'm a bleeding heart. But when your life is exposed and when the movie that exposes your life is exposing your emotions and your body, it can be very scary.\"\n\n\n\n\"Throughout this entire experience, I've learned that I can expose my heart and my emotions and I can still protect myself,\" she adds. \"I can still be vulnerable and strong. It's a constant ebb and flow and a battle and trying to figure out how to have those things coexist within me. That\u2019s what I'm grateful for.\"\n\nThe newest trailer for Fifty Shades Freed was released earlier this month, revealing that Johnson's character not only goes by \"Mrs. Grey\" now, but is pregnant! Johnson tells Allure that like all the acting roles she takes on, this one resonated strongly with her from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\"I don't know how to explain it in a way that doesn\u2019t sound hokey, but when I'm on a project, I'm on it for a certain reason, and I'm involved with the people for a reason,\" she explains. \"It's always some sort of weird marriage to something that's happening in my life, or the character has some connection to something that's going on [in my life].\"\n\n\n\nAlthough Johnson isn't expecting to walk down the aisle or have children anytime soon, it appears she's as happy as ever with her new beau, Chris Martin.\n\n\n\nShe started dating the 40-year-old Coldplay frontman last October, and the two have been seemingly inseparable ever since. They were last spotted together over the weekend, walking along the beach in Malibu, California. An eyewitness told ET at the time that they were there for about an hour and \"seemed totally in love.\"\n\n\n\nHear more on their whirlwind romance in the video below!\n\n\n\n\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n\n\n'Fifty Shades Freed' Trailer Reveals Anastasia Steele Is Pregnant!\n\n\n\n'Fifty Shades Freed' Trailer Implores Fans Not to 'Miss the Climax' as Christian and Anna Return to Red Room\n\n\n\nDakota Johnson and Chris Martin Show Sweet PDA During Romantic Malibu Beach Stroll", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2024-07/GettyImages-81248765.jpg?h=6d2f4ab3&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/gettyimages-870696138.jpg?h=6b7011a3", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/gettyimages-870696138.jpg?h=6b7011a3&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/gettyimages-870696138.jpg?h=6b7011a3", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/dakota-johnson-reveals-very-scary-parts-filming-fifty-shades-franchise-94360", "title": "Dakota Johnson Reveals the 'Very Scary' Parts of Filming 'Fifty Shades' Franchise", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/gettyimages-870696138.jpg?h=6b7011a3", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 28-year-old actress opens up about feeling 'strong' and 'vulnerable.'", "title": "Dakota Johnson Reveals the 'Very Scary' Parts of Filming 'Fifty Shades' Franchise", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/dakota-johnson-reveals-very-scary-parts-filming-fifty-shades-franchise-94360", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 28-year-old actress opens up about feeling 'strong' and 'vulnerable.'", "twitter": {"description": "The 28-year-old actress opens up about feeling 'strong' and 'vulnerable.'", "title": "Dakota Johnson Reveals the 'Very Scary' Parts of Filming 'Fifty Shades' Franchise", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/dakota-johnson-reveals-very-scary-parts-filming-fifty-shades-franchise-94360", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/gettyimages-870696138.jpg?h=6b7011a3", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Dakota Johnson Reveals the 'Very Scary' Parts of Filming 'Fifty Shades' Franchise | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, News, Dakota Johnson, Fifty Shades Freed, Fifty Shades Of Grey", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
