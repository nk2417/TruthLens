He is known for roles such as Oliver Lloyd in the ABC series Dance Academy (2012\u20132013), Wally West/Kid Flash in the CW series The Flash (2015\u20132023) and Legends of Tomorrow (2017\u20132018), and Abraham \"Bram\" Greenfeld in the film Love, Simon (2018). His other films include The Divergent Series: Insurgent (2015) and The Finest Hours (2016). Lonsdale has also worked as an MTV VJ and released original music recordings, including a studio album in 2020.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nLonsdale was born in Sydney, New South Wales, on 19 December 1991. He is the son of a Nigerian father of Edo descent and an Australian-born mother of Irish and Danish descent[4][5] and he has eleven siblings.[6][7]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nLonsdale's first acting job was at age 16, with a dancing part in the film Razzle Dazzle: A Journey into Dance (2007). The following year, he appeared in an episode of the Australian medical drama series All Saints. He was also a recurring cast member on the Australian teen drama series Dance Academy's second season (2012) in the role of Oliver Lloyd, being added-on as a regular character for the show's third, and final, season.\n\nLonsdale was then a VJ on MTV Australia and New Zealand for just under three years.[8] He recorded and released a single on iTunes, \"One and Only\", in 2014. He then played a supporting role as Uriah Pedrad in The Divergent Series: Insurgent (2015), the second film in the series,[9] later briefly reprising the role in The Divergent Series: Allegiant (2016). In 2016, his single \"Higher\" was included on Connor Franta's curated album Common Culture, volume 5.[10] He then appeared in the historical drama The Finest Hours (2016) as Eldon Hanon, the youngest sailor involved in a rescue-at-sea in 1952.\n\nIn 2015, Lonsdale auditioned for the role of Jefferson Jackson for The CW's Arrow, although the role was given to Franz Drameh.[11] Instead, he was cast as Wally West (the previously unknown son of Joe West) on CW's The Flash and became a regular supporting character on season two, and as Kid Flash on season three.[12] In 2017, the character left The Flash and debuted on season three of Legends of Tomorrow.[13] That year, Lonsdale also appeared in an episode of Supergirl.[14]\n\nIn 2018, Lonsdale played Bram in the film Love, Simon, based on Becky Albertalli's novel Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda, about a teenage boy who struggles to come out. Lonsdale later said the role helped him come to terms with his own sexuality.[15] Upon release, the film received positive reviews from critics,[16] and was dubbed historically significant, as it was the first film ever released by a major studio to focus on a gay teenage romance.[17][18]\n\nIn 2019, Lonsdale starred in Camila Cabello's music video for \"Liar\".[19] He has also released several singles, including \"Higher\" (2015), \"Good Life\" (2017), \"Kiss the Boy\" (2018), and \"Preach\" (2018), as well as \"Rainbow Dragon\" (2019).[20] Lonsdale released \"Lonely Point of View\" in 2023.\n\nOn 19 June 2025, Lonsdale was announced in the cast for a yet to be titled Postcard Bandit series for Foxtel.[21]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nIn 2017, Lonsdale came out on Instagram saying \"I like girls, & I like guys\",[22] not self-identifying with a specific term or sexuality label. He later came out as gay in a 2022 interview with BuzzFeed.[23][24]\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nStudio albums [ edit ]\n\nTitle Album details Rainbow Boy Released: 29 May 2020 [ 25 ]\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming Heart Defence Mixtape Released: 8 December 2023\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming\n\nExtended plays [ edit ]\n\nTitle EP details Higher Vol. 1 Released: 6 October 2015 [ 26 ]\n\nFormat: Digital download 3rd Eye\n\n(with Intyce and Invadea) Released: 19 December 2021\n\nLabel: InvadeAvision\n\nFormat: Digital download, streaming\n\nSingles [ edit ]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nAwards and nominations [ edit ]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2f/Keiynan_Lonsdale_%282%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/250px-Keiynan_Lonsdale_%282%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Keiynan_Lonsdale_%282%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/40px-Commons-logo.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Keiynan_Lonsdale_%282%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiynan_Lonsdale", "title": "Keiynan Lonsdale", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.3", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2f/Keiynan_Lonsdale_%282%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "width": 787, "height": 1200}, "title": "Keiynan Lonsdale - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
