Afterward, van den Herik modeled in Paris, Milan, Sydney, Cape Town, Tokyo, New York, Los Angeles, and Hamburg.[2] She modeled for 15 years before wanting to settle down and start a family. In 1994, van den Herik moved to Los Angeles to start her family after meeting and marrying Mohamed Hadid.[4]\n\nOn 11 January 2018, her reality TV show competition Making a Model with Yolanda Hadid premiered on Lifetime, which has been developed under the working title Model Moms.[5]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nVan den Herik's daughters, models Bella and Gigi Hadid\n\nHadid's first marriage was to Mohamed Hadid, a real estate developer, from 1994 until 2000.[6] The couple has three children together, Jelena \"Gigi\"[2] (born 23 April 1995), Isabella \"Bella\" (born 9 October 1996),[2] and Anwar (born 22 June 1999).[2]\n\nHadid married musician, composer, and producer David Foster in Beverly Hills, California on 11 November 2011, after becoming engaged on Christmas Eve, 2010.[7]\n\nOn 1 December 2015, Hadid announced she and David Foster planned to divorce.[8][6] The divorce was finalized on 16 October 2017.[9]\n\nShe became a naturalized US citizen on 23 May 2013.[10]\n\nIn May 2020, Hadid announced she was in a relationship with the CEO of a construction and development company called Jingoli, Joseph \"Joey\" Jingoli.
