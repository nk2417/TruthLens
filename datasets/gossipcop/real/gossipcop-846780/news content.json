Yeah, the release date announcement video is less than 20 seconds and just scans an abandoned mess hall in the prison. But we\u2019re willing to overlook the lack of action now that we know when the sixth installment will drop.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost a year since we saw the ladies of Litchfield and, based on the one line of dialogue we get in the clip, we can tell you we\u2019re entering a whole new world with them when they return. Well, at least that\u2019s what Piper (Taylor Schilling) says and based on where we left things last year, its safe to say the times are a changin\u2019.\n\nIn case you didn\u2019t remember (since it\u2019s been a while) the final episode of season five played out over three days during a riot and saw Piper, Alex (Laura Prepon) and Nicky (Natasha Lyonne), holed up in Frieda\u2019s bunker that had just been turned over by CERT officers, while the rest of the penitentiary\u2019s inmates were loaded up on buses and shipped out to new prisons.\n\n\u201cOITNB\u201d is produced by Lionsgate and also stars Laverne Cox, Uzo Aduba, Danielle Brooks and Dascha Palanco.\n\nWatch the teaser below.\n\n\u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d Season 6 will drop on July 27 on Netflix.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?fit=53%2C58&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325_COVER-_IR_5x4.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/orange-is-the-new-black-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/orange-is-the-new-black-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Maas", "Ashley Boucher", "Tv Reporter", "Jennifer.Maas Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/orange-is-the-new-black-season-6-release-date-netflix-video/", "title": "\u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 Season 6 Locks Up Netflix Release Date (Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Orange Is the New Black' Season 6 Locks Up Netflix Release Date (Video)", "description": "Say goodbye to Litchfield, ladies", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/orange-is-the-new-black-season-6-release-date-netflix-video/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/orange-is-the-new-black-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2018-06-05T15:00:33+00:00"}, "author": "Jennifer Maas and Ashley Boucher", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Jennifer Maas and Ashley Boucher", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "laura_prepon, netflix, oitnb, orange_is_the_new_black, taylor_schilling", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528210833.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
