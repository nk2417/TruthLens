How Prince Harry fell for Meghan Markle: The story of their romance in pictures on the anniversary of their engagement\n\nIT\u2019S the ultimate fairy tale romance \u2013 the glamorous American actress marries the handsome British prince.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle announced their engagement a year ago today and a whole lot has happened since then.\n\nThe couple revealed that Harry had proposed on November 27, 2017, just over a year after Kensington Palace first confirmed their relationship.\n\nMeghan, 37, and 34-year-old Harry married at St George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor Castle on May 19.\n\nThey\u2019re now expecting their first child together, due in spring.\n\nHere, we take a look back at the pair\u2019s love story so far\u2026\n\nThe spooning bananas\n\nGlamorous Meghan first met Harry in 2016, after being introduced by mutual friend Markus Anderson at central London\u2019s Soho House in early June.\n\nReports claim that Harry \u2013 who had \u2018lusted\u2019 after Meghan\u2019s Suits character Rachel Zane for two years \u2013 was immediately smitten and besieged the American with texts until she agreed to a date.\n\nThe pair met in London several times, with Meghan papped in the Royal Box at Wimbledon, and in Los Angeles after Harry treated her to a weekend at his best friend\u2019s house in the Hollywood Hills.\n\nIn October, the first hint that the couple were dating emerged when Meghan posted a snap on Instagram of her wearing a blue beaded bracelet.\n\nHarry was pictured wearing the same bracelet during his summer trip to Africa, where he reportedly picked it up.\n\nAfter that, the trinket rarely left Meghan\u2019s wrist.\n\nOn November 1, 2016, Meghan uploaded a cryptic Instagram post featuring a picture of two canoodling bananas, with the caption: \u201cSleep tight xx\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s official\n\nHarry confirmed their relationship on November 8, 2016 \u2013 and made an unprecedented appeal via Kensington Palace for them to be left in peace.\n\nRoyal fans took that as a sign of how serious it is between the pair, with a pal confirming it had \u201cmoved very fast and they can\u2019t bear to be apart\u201d.\n\nThat awkward moment in Antigua\u2026\n\nDuring an official visit to the Caribbean nation on November 21, 2016, Prime Minister Gaston Browne teased Harry by announcing: \u201cI believe we are expecting a new princess soon.\n\n\u201cI want know that you are very welcome to come on your honeymoon here\u2026 there will be nowhere in the world as special to spend your honeymoon, when that day arrives.\u201d\n\nApparently the Prince was \u201cclearly embarrassed\u201d and \u201cwent bright red\u201d. Aww.\n\nPublic dates\n\nIn December 2016, we brought you the first pictures of the loved-up pair strolling through London on their way to West End show The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime.\n\nThe day before, they were reportedly spotted buying their first Christmas tree together in south London.\n\nIn January, the couple enjoyed a romantic first holiday together after Harry whisked Meghan to Norway to see the Northern Lights.\n\nMeeting the family\n\nHarry was reported to have gained the blessing of Meghan\u2019s dad Thomas before the pair went public.\n\nOn January 15, 2017, Harry introduced Meghan to the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte at Kensington Palace.\n\nIn March she joined Harry at his mate\u2019s wedding in Montego Bay, Jamaica, where he was an usher.\n\nBut onlookers said THEY were the couple behaving most like honeymooners\u2026\n\nWedding bells?\n\nSuggestions that the couple were soon to tie the knot were ramped up a gear when Meghan shut down her lifestyle website The Tig after nearly three years.\n\nHaving described it as her \u201cpassion project\u201d, reports stated that the actress\u2019s decision was related to her busy filming schedule and humanitarian work.\n\nThe car park clinch\n\nWhile Harry took part in the annual Audi Polo Challenge in Ascot, Meghan was snapped planting a smacker on his cheek in the car park.\n\nThe same weekend she was spotted cheering on her man from the sidelines.\n\nHarry\u2019s desperate dash\n\nDespite being invited, Meghan was notably absent from Pippa Middleton\u2019s wedding to James Matthews in May 2017, apparently to avoid upstaging the bride.\n\nBut clearly keen to have his girlfriend by his side, Harry made a 100-mile round trip to pick her up from Kensington Palace and escort her to the party at the Middleton\u2019s home in Bucklebury.\n\nNow, that\u2019s romance.\n\nThe crown jewels\n\nIn June 2017 it was reported that Harry gave Meghan a gold ring \u2013 which turned out to be too big, so she wore it on her thumb.\n\nHe previously gifted her a Cartier Love bracelet, a Maya Brenner necklace with the initials \u201cM\u201d and \u201cH\u201d and a gold arrow ring.\n\nThe birthday safari\n\nWith both sharing a mutual love of animals, Harry treated Meghan to a romantic African holiday for her 36th birthday in August 2017.\n\nHe was snapped putting a protective arm around his girl as they arrived, while she carried a gift from him swathed in bubble wrap.\n\nA source said: \u201cObviously he wants to show Meghan what an amazing place it is and create new memories together.\n\n\u201cHarry\u2019s done a lot of conservation work in Africa with endangered elephants and black rhinos and he\u2019ll show them to the woman he wants to marry.\u201d\n\nAnother pointed out that he wanted to \u201cassociate August with something joyful\u201d, referring to the anniversary of his mum Princess Diana\u2019s death.\n\nThat loved-up interview\n\nIn September 2017, Meghan opened up to Vanity Fair about being \u201creally happy and in love\u201d with her prince.\n\nShe confirmed they met in the summer of 2016 and dated quietly for six months.\n\nMeghan also said \u201cthere will be a time\u201d when they\u2019re more prepared to share their life with the public but for now they want to keep things private.\n\nShe added: \u201cIt\u2019s part of what makes it so special, that it\u2019s just ours. But we\u2019re happy. Personally, I love a great love story.\u201d\n\nSo do we!\n\nThe first official public appearance\n\nIn September 2017, Meghan joined Harry at the annual Invictus Games in Toronto, where she lived and filmed Suits.\n\nDespite the fact they sat 18 seats apart, she was spotted cheering on her fella during the opening ceremony.\n\nThe next day they sat together for a Wheelchair Tennis event \u2013 and the pictures spoke volumes.\n\nHarry even flew out Meghan\u2019s mum Doria 2,500 miles from LA to join them for the occasion \u2013 and planted an affectionate kiss on his girlfriend\u2019s cheek while watching the closing ceremony.\n\nA big proposal\n\nIt was confirmed on November 27, 2017 that Harry and Meghan were engaged.\n\nMeghan said they were roasting a chicken when Harry got down on one knee at his home, Nottingham Cottage.\n\nIn their engagement interview, she explained: \u201c[It was] just an amazing surprise, it was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got down on one knee.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact I could barely let you finish proposing, I said: \u2018Can I say yes now?'\u201d\n\nHarry replied: \u201cShe didn\u2019t even let me finish, she said: \u2018Can I say yes, can I say yes?\u2019 and then there were hugs and I had the ring\u2026 and I was like: \u2018Can I \u2013 can I give you the ring?'\u201d\n\nThe first royal outing\n\nOn December 1, 2017, the couple made their first official appearance as an engaged couple.\n\nThey headed to Nottingham, where they greeted excited crowds ahead of a visit to a World Aids Day charity fair hosted by the Terrence Higgins Trust.\n\nCelebrating Christmas\n\nMeghan and Harry joined Prince William and Kate Middleton at the Royal Family\u2019s traditional Christmas Day service in Sandringham on December 25, 2017.\n\nMeghan also attended the Queen\u2019s Windsor Castle Christmas party for staff, in a sign that she\u2019d effectively become a fully-fledged member of the Royal Family.\n\nA guest at the party said: \u201cShe asked everyone she met their names and what they did.
