Was love officially dead? It looked that way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating. We tried hard for a long time, and we\u2019re really disappointed,\u201d Chris shared to Facebook at the time.\n\nBut apart from that bleak announcement, Pratt has never spoken publicly about the high-profile split \u2013 until now.\n\nHappier times. (Credit: Getty)\n\n\u201cDivorce sucks,\u201d Pratt told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cBut at the end of the day, we\u2019ve got a great kid who\u2019s got two parents who love him very much. And we\u2019re finding a way to navigate this while still remaining friends and still being kind to one another. It\u2019s not ideal, but yeah, I think both of us are actually probably doing better.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaris has previously opened up about the former couple\u2019s co-parenting arrangement, telling E! News in January: \u201cI think the key is surrounding him with a lot of joy and happiness, which he has a ton of.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BFKzVCvjHH-/?utm_source=ig_embed\n\nThe actress has also spoken about her new views on marriage after walking down the aisle twice.\n\n\u201cI need to figure out what the purpose is,\u201d the 41-year-old explained on friend Dax Shepard\u2019s podcast. \u201cIs it safety for your children? Is it convention? Is it so other people respect your relationship more?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaris added: \u201cFor me, I\u2019m just not quite sure where it fits\u2026I am a romantic. I believe in a partnership, I believe in companionship. I just don\u2019t know if I believe in a ceremony of a wedding.\u201d", "images": ["https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/media/33885/chris-pratt.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/ygwtht_websiteheader_leslie_bibb-691e5e9e1e8d8.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/media/33885/chris-pratt.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/copy-of-mc-site-header-2-pics-horizontal-2025-11-12t181637.343-6914345922e0a.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/ss-header-2-pics-horizontal-2-69112bfe138c0.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.marieclaire.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/11/Logo.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/copy-of-mc-site-header-2-pics-horizontal-32-691689f19419c.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.marieclaire.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/hunger-games-site-image-placement-1-6852540a0721b.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/media/34488/chris-pratt-anna-faris-180419.jpg?resize=731%2C1024", "https://www.marieclaire.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/icon-phosphor-circle.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/copy-of-header-heatwave-7-690a8015477ec.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/mcelle-lead-image-template-2025-11-11t132306.215-69129e1a1096a.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/woty-header-691e938bef781-scaled.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/media/39315/anna-mcclelland-journalist.jpg?fit=128%2C128", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/ss-header-2-pics-horizontal-7-69141777a21b8.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/copy-of-copy-of-header-heatwave-26-690c102916d38.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/copy-of-copy-of-mc-site-header-2-pics-horizontal-37-691d1424d3707.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/ss-header-2-pics-horizontal-1-690aa8703db68.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/11/mcm-6907f643a481b.jpg?resize=444%2C579", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/team-jeremiah-vs-team-conrad-the-summer-i-turned-pretty-9-691e587d7e5df.jpg?resize=380%2C285"], "top_img": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/media/33885/chris-pratt.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Mcclelland", "Anna Is Marie Claire", "Instyle'S Assistant Digital Content Manager", "Reporting On Everything Sell-Out Skincare To Meghan Markle'S Messy Bun.
