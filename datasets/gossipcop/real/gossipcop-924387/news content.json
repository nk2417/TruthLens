It was overwhelming,\u201d said one person close to her campaign.\n\nDash, perhaps best known for her role as Dionne in the 1995 comedy Clueless, was a Democrat who voted for President Barack Obama in 2008, though by 2012 she had switched parties and she has been controversial (at least among liberals) practically ever since.\n\nIn 2016, for example, she criticized feminists for not allowing men to \u201cbe masculine\u201d and she criticized the notion of transgender people choosing which public restroom to use, calling it a \u201ctyranny by the minority.\u201d\n\nDash, a black and Hispanic woman, also criticized the BET Awards and Black History Month, opinions that led to an appearance at the 2016 Oscars where Chris Rock jokingly introduced her to a baffled audience as the \u201cnew director\u201d of the Academy\u2019s \u201cminority outreach program.\u201d\n\nIn a lengthy statement emailed to THR, Dash acknowledged she intends to quit the race, saying her \u201cgoal was, and remains, to improve the lives of people who have been forgotten for decades by the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nDash had been one of three conservatives in Hollywood who had decided to run for office as Republicans in California; former soap star Antonio Sabato Jr. is running for Congress in the state\u2019s 26th District and film producer Frank DeMartini is running for the seat occupied by Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of California\u2019s 43rd District.\n\n\u201cAfter much prayer, introspection and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my candidacy,\u201d Dash said in her statement. \u201cI believe that the overall bitterness surrounding our political process, participating in the rigors of campaigning, and holding elected office would be detrimental to the health and wellbeing of my family. I would never want to betray the personal and spiritual principles I believe in most: that my God and my family come first.\u201d\n\nShe added that she knows her \u201cpolitical positions have often been labeled as controversial, but the real controversy is how decades of government corruption and political disempowerment have created a system where skyrocketing home prices, dirty needles in the streets, and long bus trips to other districts for jobs are somehow considered acceptable.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/769341148_5761248216001_5761250500001-vs.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/769341148_5761248216001_5761250500001-vs.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paul Bond", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/stacey-dash-withdraw-congressional-race-1098721/", "title": "Stacey Dash to Withdraw From Congressional Race", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "She had been running as a Republican in California's 44th District.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Paul Bond", "tags": "Stacey Dash", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Stacey Dash to Withdraw From Congressional Race", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/stacey-dash-withdraw-congressional-race-1098721/", "description": "She had been running as a Republican in California's 44th District.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/769341148_5761248216001_5761250500001-vs.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "Stacey Dash Withdraw From Congressional Race"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-30T13:15:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-30T16:06:36+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "She had been running as a Republican in California's 44th District.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Stacey Dash to Withdraw From Congressional Race", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/769341148_5761248216001_5761250500001-vs.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522415755.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
