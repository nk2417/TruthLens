The alleged drunk driver rounded a bend when he crossed his pickup truck into oncoming traffic and struck Macklemore\u2019s Mercedes-Benz.\n\nThe alleged drunk driver, who was not wearing a seatbelt, smashed his head into the windshield, leaving him briefly unconscious. He was taken to a local hospital for treatment, and was subsequently charged with a DUI.\n\nRelated Video\n\nOne of Macklemore\u2019s passengers was treated for a minor cut to the head, but all three people walked away from the accident.", "images": ["https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-Weeknd.jpeg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&fit=278%2C156&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/themes/cosv2/images/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/facial.png?w=590&h=332&crop=1&fit=590%2C332&quality=80&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-01-at-2-21-35-pm.png?w=590&h=332&crop=1&fit=590%2C332&quality=80&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Gary-22Mani22-Mounfield.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&fit=278%2C156&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Dave-Grohl-Gibson-featured.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&fit=278%2C156&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Pras-Michel.jpeg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&fit=278%2C156&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nick-cave-geese-trinidad.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&fit=278%2C156&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/major-labels-deal-ai-music-startup.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&fit=278%2C156&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/health-ordinary-loss-hsotw.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&fit=278%2C156&strip", "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/themes/cosv2/images/LiveMusicWeek.png", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/the-chair-company-tim-robinson_6.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&fit=278%2C156&strip"], "top_img": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/themes/cosv2/images/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Young"], "canonical_link": "https://consequence.net/2017/08/macklemore-survives-head-on-collision-with-drunk-driver/", "title": "Macklemore survives head-on collision with drunk driver", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2f2e2a", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1561075967, app-argument=https://consequence.net/2017/08/macklemore-survives-head-on-collision-with-drunk-driver", "fb": {"app_id": 434175690014}, "msvalidate.01": "8CABEAF0C9CE91FCEDBFB11C38206EE5", "description": "The rapper and two of his passengers miraculously escaped almost entirely unharmed.", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Macklemore survives head-on collision with drunk driver", "description": "The rapper and two of his passengers miraculously escaped almost entirely unharmed.", "url": "https://consequence.net/2017/08/macklemore-survives-head-on-collision-with-drunk-driver/", "site_name": "Consequence"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/consequence/", "tag": "Rap", "section": "News", "published_time": "2017-08-01T13:50:10-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Macklemore survives head-on collision with drunk driver", "description": "The rapper and two of his passengers miraculously escaped almost entirely unharmed.", "site": "@consequence", "creator": "@alexyoung", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Alex Young", "label2": "Time to read", "data2": "Less than a minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "parsely-title": "Macklemore survives head-on collision with drunk driver", "parsely-link": "http://consequence.net/2017/08/macklemore-survives-head-on-collision-with-drunk-driver/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-08-01T17:50:10Z", "parsely-section": "News", "parsely-tags": "car crash,drunk driver,hip-hop,rap", "parsely-author": "Alex Young", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cropped-correct-blue.jpg?quality=80&w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501609810.0, "source": "https://consequenceofsound.net", "summary": ""}
