The 2024 VMAs are touching down at the UBS Arena on Wednesday, September 11, and we can\u2019t wait to watch hot girl Megan Thee Stallion take on hosting duties for the night. Of course, this year\u2019s ceremony is bringing on a ton of star-studded guests ~as per usual~, and some of the power pop players of the year are hitting the main stage (Chappell Roan and Cosmo cover girl Sabrina Carpenter, to name a few \ud83d\udc40).\n\nSo let\u2019s catch you up to speed ahead of the show so you don\u2019t miss a beat. Below, find all the performers taking the stage at the 2024 VMAs.\n\nExtended Play\n\nJessie Murph\n\nTaylor Hill // Getty Images\n\nJessie Murph is riding on the high of releasing her debut album That Ain\u2019t No Man That\u2019s the Devil as she takes the Extended Play stage at this year\u2019s ceremony.
