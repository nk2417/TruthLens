The family were all pictured grinning as they stood in the countryside, with the Duchess of Cambridge holding her youngest child in her arms. Meanwhile, the older two children stood beside their parents, standing on a horizontal part of a tree. The royals are often admired for their style choices, so where did the family get their outfits from for the latest picture?\n\nKate Middleton Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT The Duchess of Cambridge opted for a pair of blue jeans for the rural-themed photoshoot. While the exact brand is currently unknown, Kate has worn jeans a number of times before. For instance, in the past, the mother-of-three has been spotted wearing J Brand jeans in the past - specifically the 811 Mid-Rise Skinny Leg in navy twill - which retailed at $158 (\u00a3126) on the website nordstrom.com. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT She teamed the look with a pale checked shirt, as well as a pale khaki coloured jumper. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT Except for the slightly different shade, the sweater looked strikingly similar to the \u00d6vik Re-Wool Sweater by the company Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven - costing $150 (around \u00a3120). Kate wore the jumper in October this year, after returning to her royal duties following her time on maternity leave. The Duchess finished off the look with a pair of sparkling oak leap earrings from Asprey - which come in at a whopping \u00a35,000.\n\nRoyal Family Christmas card: Kate Middleton and Prince William and their children posed for a photo\n\nPrince George In the portrait, the eldest of the Cambridge children could be seen wearing trousers for the first time in an official royal photo. The garment is thought to be the Amaia Freddie trousers in blue, which come in at \u00a350. Prince George also sported a green cable knit jumper which had orange edging, and a collared shirt. For the wintery walk, he donned Hunter Kids\u2019 First boots - costing \u00a335. Princess Charlotte\n\n\n\nThe young princess wore a navy blue ensemble - which included a Fina Ejerique cardigan.\n\n\n\nPrincess Charlotte wore the number earlier this year in official photographs with her newborn brother Prince Louis, with Prince George also wearing the cardigan in the past for official photographs in honour of Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s 90th birthday, back in 2016.\n\n\n\nPrince William\n\n\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge also opted for a pair of jeans, however it is unknown where these are from.\n\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
