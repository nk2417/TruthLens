I stopped him and managed to get out of the room.\n\n\u201cI still got the part for the film and always thought that he gave it to me because of what happened.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cSince then I felt awful that I did the movie. I felt like I didn\u2019t deserve the part. I was so hesitant about speaking out\u2026.I didn\u2019t want to hurt his family. I felt guilty as if I did something wrong.\n\n\u201cI was also terrified that this sort of thing had happened to so many women I know but no one had said anything because of fear.\u201d\n\nFall from grace: what we know\n\nCara is the latest in a long line of Hollywood A-listers who have accused Weinstein of sexually assaulting them.\n\nIn the past 24 hours multiple women \u2013 including Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow \u2013 have made accusations against the Hollywood producer.\n\nIt comes just hours after Hollywood star Ewan McGregor slammed Weinstein, 64, saying he heard \u201crumours\u201d about the movie mogul\u2019s behaviour over many years.\n\nMcGregor, the star of the Trainspotting films, said Weinsten was getting his \u201cjust deserts\u201d and added: \u201cBye bully.\u201d\n\nThe Oscar-winning producer has also been accused of raping three women in explosive new allegations.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s British wife Georgina Chapman also said she was leaving him last night as the new allegations mounted.\n\nHER ACCOUNT IN FULL \u201cWhen I first started to work as an actress, I was working on a film and I received a call from Harvey Weinstein asking if I had slept with any of the women I was seen out with in the media. It was a very odd and uncomfortable call. \u201cI answered none of his questions and hurried off the phone but before I hung up, he said to me that if I was gay or decided to be with a woman especially in public that I\u2019d never get the role of a straight woman or make it as an actress in Hollywood. \u201cA year or two later, I went to a meeting with him in the lobby of a hotel with a director about an upcoming film. The director left the meeting and Harvey asked me to stay and chat with him. \u201cAs soon as we were alone he began to brag about all the actresses he had slept with and how he had made their careers and spoke about other inappropriate things of a sexual nature. \u201cHe then invited me to his room. \u201cI quickly declined and asked his assistant if my car was outside. She said it wasn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t be for a bit and I should go to his room. \u201cAt that moment I felt very powerless and scared but didn\u2019t want to act that way hoping that I was wrong about the situation. When I arrived I was relieved to find another woman in his room and thought immediately I was safe. \u201cHe asked us to kiss and she began some sort of advances upon his direction. I swiftly got up and asked him if he knew that I could sing. And I began to sing. \u201cI thought it would make the situation better \u2013 more professional, like an audition. I was so nervous. \u201cAfter singing I said again that I had to leave. He walked me to the door and stood in front of it and tried to kiss me on the lips. I stopped him and managed to get out of the room. \u201cI still got the part for the film and always thought that he gave it to me because of what happened. \u201cSince then I felt awful that I did the movie. I felt like I didn\u2019t deserve the part. I was so hesitant about speaking out. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to hurt his family. I felt guilty as if I did something wrong. I was also terrified that this sort of thing had happened to so many women I know but no one had said anything because of fear.\u201d She later posted a second message on the social networking site. It read: \u201cI want women and girls to know that being harassed or abused or raped is NEVER their fault and not talking about it will always cause more damage than speaking the truth. \u201cI am relieved to be able to share this. I actually feel better and I\u2019m proud of the women who are brave enough to speak. \u201cThis isn\u2019t easy but there are strength in our numbers. As I said, this is only the beginning. In every industry and especially in Hollywood, men abuse their power using fear and get away with it. This must stop. \u201cThe more we talk about it, the less power we give them. I urge you all to talk and to the people who defend these men, you are part of the problem.\u201d\n\nWe pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?
