So now\u2019s the time to catch-up or re-watch the movies that dominated the 2018 nominees lists.\n\nAll of the big-hitters below are available to stream on this Christmas, so there\u2019s no excuse not to make the most of the miserable winter weather and settle in for a movie marathon. Dramatic gown optional.\n\nFor some fantasy romance\u2026 The Shape of Water\n\n20th Century Studios\n\nWe\u2019re not going to lie, we weren\u2019t sure what to expect from a film about a mute cleaner who falls in love with a humanoid amphibian. And yes, that really is the storyline. But its uniqueness is what makes it special \u2013 even when it comes to the now-infamous bathroom scene. We\u2019ll leave you to work out what goes on there.\n\nThe movie, which beat some seriously strong contenders to win Best Picture at the Oscars, is beautifully shot \u2013 and we love that Sally Hawkins was nominated for Best Actress for playing a character who communicates through sign language. She stars alongside Octavia Spencer, who\u2019s as brilliant as ever. Expect to become fully immersed (pun intended).\n\nFor a thoroughly British drama\u2026 Darkest Hour\n\nUniversal\n\nIn this WWII biopic Gary Oldman plays Winston Churchill, undergoing the most mind-blowing makeover since Charlize Theron\u2019s transformation in Monster. Oldman bagged the Best Actor accolade at the Oscars, BAFTAs and Golden Globes, so it\u2019s fair to say you\u2019ll be blown away by his performance.\n\nThere\u2019s also a strong female supporting cast: Lily James portrays the politician\u2019s personal secretary, while Kristin Scott Thomas is fantastic as his loyal wife Clemmie. A great choice to watch with your family over Christmas.\n\nFor a gritty drama\u2026 Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\n\n20th Century Studios\n\nThis smart, intense, bittersweet story centres around Mildred Hayes (Frances McDormand), who\u2019s dealing with the murder of her teenage daughter. Angry over the lack of progress in the investigation, Mildred rents three billboards, posting messages to the local police chief (Woody Harrelson).\n\nWinning the Golden Globe for Best Picture and the BAFTA for Best Film, you wouldn\u2019t think a drama about a grieving mother could have moments of wry comedy amongst the tragedy, but Three Billboards manages it. Frances McDormand is a total powerhouse (it\u2019s no surprise she won Best Actress at the Oscars, Golden Globes and BAFTAs) and will keep you gripped from start to finish.\n\nFor an epic animation\u2026 Coco\n\nWalt Disney/Pixar\n\nInspired by Mexico\u2019s Day of the Dead celebrations, this Disney Pixar gem follows a 12-year-old boy who\u2019s accidentally transported to the Land of the Dead, and needs his great-great-grandfather\u2019s help to get back to world of the living.\n\nIt might be aimed at kids, but it\u2019s been making grown adults blub since its release. Praised for its moving storyline and respect for Mexican culture, it cleaned up during awards season, winning Best Animated Film at the Oscars, BAFTAs and Golden Globes.\n\nEven if you haven\u2019t watched it, you probably already know its (Oscar-winning) lead song. Remember Me has been stuck in our heads for months.\n\nFor a sun-soaked love story\u2026 Call Me By Your Name\n\nSony Pictures\n\nThe movie that put Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet on our radar \u2013 Call Me By Your Name is set in 1980s Italy and follows the budding relationship between 17-year-old Elio (Chalamet) and his father's assistant Oliver (Armie Hammer).\n\nBased on the novel by American writer Andr\u00e9 Aciman, it won Best Adapted Screenplay at the Oscars and BAFTAs. There\u2019s no crazy drama, just a beautiful love story that draws you in. And thanks to its picturesque setting, it\u2019s gorgeous to look at. Don\u2019t blame us if you\u2019re booking flights to Italy by the time the credits roll.\n\nStream over 1000 movies on this Christmas, including loads of award winners!", "images":
