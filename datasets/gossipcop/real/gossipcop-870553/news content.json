Once the party headed to Florence, guests stayed at least a night at either the St. Regis or Four Seasons. Both offer rooms for about $885 a night. Multiply all that by roughly 200 guests and the hotel price tag could be more than half a million dollars. That\u2019s not to mention the family\u2019s luxe Villa San Michele accommodations in Florence, which cost at least $1,800 a night per room.\n\nPre-Wedding Spree\n\nAmong the wedding activities list was a private bachelorette dinner for the bride and her closest girlfriends at H\u00f4tel Costes, home of one of Paris\u2019 top restaurants. With prices up to $190 a plate, that dinner alone comes in at nearly $4,100 \u2013 probably much much less than the cost of the next day\u2019s rehearsal dinner, which included a performance by Lana Del Rey (Kanye is rumored to have paid her a pretty penny to sing Kardashian\u2019s favorite song, \u201cYoung and Beautiful\u201d) and the subsequent guided tour of Versailles.\n\nPrivate Transportation\n\nIn order to get their guests from pre-wedding festivities in Paris to the main event in Florence, the Wests chartered two private jets. Once on the ground a fleet of 45 to 50 cars and vans shuttled them to and from the Florence airport. The price for the cars alone is estimated at nearly $70,000, gas included.\n\nHair and Makeup for All\n\nLucky guests availed themselves of a full glam team for the couple\u2019s big day. High-end Paris-based stylist Allison Depriestre says such a service could easily cost $380 per person. For 200-plus guests that\u2019s more than $65,000 just to get pretty.\n\nThe Breathtaking Venue\n\nThe over-the-top couple said their official \u201cI do\u201ds atop Forte di Belvedere, an imposing 16th-century fortress in Florence offering gorgeous views of the ancient Italian city. Kardashian and West are said to have spent more than $409,000 to rent the property for their May 24 wedding. That\u2019s before all of the upgrades, lighting and construction needed for the grand event.\n\nRare Flowers\n\nWith fresh flower walls similar to the one West gifted his bride for Mother\u2019s Day, the wedding\u2019s buds alone cost a small fortune. Among the mountain of flower arrangements that arrived at the fort were bushels of tuberose, which is extremely rare this time of year, renowned for its beautiful unique scent and considered an almost sacred flower. Florists at Fiori Della Signoria, one of the city\u2019s oldest flower shops, estimate total flower costs to be $136,000.\n\nFabulous Food\n\nTop chefs Annie F\u00e9olde and her husband, Giorgio Pinchiorri, led Florence-based Galateo catering company in handling the super-tasty, super-pricey wedding menu. Considering F\u00e9olde and Pinchiorri\u2019s own renowned Florentine restaurant Enoteca Pinchiorri \u2013 where a plate of spaghetti can set you back $100 \u2013 the wedding feast was easily in the tens of thousands. Add on the couple\u2019s 7-ft wedding cake and the price climbs even higher.\n\nCouture Everything\n\nThe Vogue cover couple got hitched in front of all their designer-clad guests wearing the best Givenchy had to offer. For Kardashian that meant a custom Givenchy Haute Couture gown designed by her friend Riccardo Tisci, estimated cost up to $500,000. Not to be upstaged, daughter North donned a mini matching handmade dress, which was probably a little bit cheaper.\n\nGuests say the week\u2019s pomp and circumstance was all worth it. As Kardashian family friend Malika Haqq told PEOPLE after the wedding, \u201cKanye really went all out there with his love.\u201d No kidding!\n\nReporting by EMMA TYLER, ANDREA LAVINTHAL and MARY GREEN\n\nKim & Kanye\u2019s Relationship: From Flirtation to Family\n\nMore on Kim & Kanye\u2019s Wedding:\n\n\u2022 From Europe with Love!
