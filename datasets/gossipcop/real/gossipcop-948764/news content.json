So when the world found out that the on-screen actors were dating in real life - the fandom totally lost their minds.\n\nNaturally, everyone wanted them to make a declaration of their love and open up about falling in love on set. However, if it's something that Lili Reinhart and Cole Sprouse have done perfectly - it's to not confirm, deny, or even acknowledge their relationship to the media and public. Which of course they have the absolute right to do.\n\nREAD ALSO: Riverdale's Lili Reinhart Gets Real About Her Cystic Acne On Social Media While Showing Off Her Breakouts\n\nIt was suspected that the secrecy around the relationship was all due to uber private child actor Cole Sprouse - however, we recently found out that Lili Reinhart is also totally on board the keeping her love life on the down low and out of the public eye. She opened up to Harpers Bazaar all about it.\n\n@llilireinhartttembedded via\n\nThe actress revealed to Harpers Bazaar that naturally, she's pretty reserved when it comes to opening up about her personal life. That has been compounded now that she's found fame through her Riverdale role.\n\nAccording to Lili having fans expect her to 'be on' all the time is the most dehumanizing thing and while she appreciates their love and support, she also expects them to understand that she won't be in actor mode 100% of the time. And I shouldn't be expected to be. Which is why she will politely decline stopping for fans if she's in a situation where she'd rather not have that interaction or why she won't answer personal questions.\n\nShe told the magazine:\n\n\"I'm not okay talking about my relationship. I'm not going to tell you my love story. That's just not appropriate right now.\u201d\n\nA tribute to Grace Kelly \ud83d\udc5b\ud83c\udf34 A post shared by Lili Reinhart (@lilireinhart) on Jul 2, 2018 at 7:17pm PDT\n\nLili adds that her family is also off-limits, \u201cIt really weirds me out when people DM my mom\u201d\n\nAnd when it comes to all her fans and the press prying into her personal life, she says that's the biggest adjustment to her new found fame. She calls it \u201cthe speculation\u201d and says:\n\n\"Am I pregnant? Am I dating someone? Am I gay? Am I gaining weight? Am I homophobic? People will always have something to say. I\u2019ve accepted that. It doesn't mean it's not frustrating when people say those things. It's not like it just rolls off my back.\u201d\n\n@lilireinhartembedded via\n\nShe also told the magazine that she doesn't live in L.A., her life is not glamorous and that she loves acting but doesn't do it so that she can be famous - it's just a byproduct of pursuing the career she is passionate about.\n\nNaturally, Lili's parting remarks in the interview were to give us a small taste of what she would like to see happen to her character Betty Cooper in season 3 of Riverdale:\n\n\u201cIn the season finale, when you saw Betty and Jughead in bed together, she's smiling when he says, \"Will you be my serpent queen?\" [Aguirre-Sacasa] told me, \u2018When I watched that scene and I saw Betty smile, it made me want more of that.\" Reinhart likes the sound of this storyline. \u201cI think the girl deserves a break.\u201d\n\nSource: Harpers Bazaar", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20200808171214im_/https://www.narcity.com/u/2019/04/07/73bfadc0b3fdc6e8226bc330767c833f.png",
