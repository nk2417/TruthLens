Promise.\n\nAs someone who binge-watched season 2 of The Real Housewives of New Jersey with my mom when I was home sick from (elementary!!) school and has her phone set to \"Do Not Disturb\" when new episodes of Summer House drop, I'd say I know a thing or two about Bravo.\n\nThe network, best known for the Real Housewives franchise, is more popular than ever, thanks to pop culture juggernauts like Scandoval\u2014a Vanderpump Rules cheating bombshell that dominated headlines\u2014and Bravocon, a convention known for starting more drama than a color-coded binder at a Real Housewives reunion.\n\nIn a Marvel Cinematic Universe-esque twist, many of Bravo's shows are now connected as Bravolebrities cross over to different shows. Fans of Craig Conover and Paige DeSorbo, who I hereby declare Bravo's royal couple, can watch their relationship unfold on Summer House, Southern Charm, AND Winter House.\n\nWhile diving into the wonderful world of Bravo might seem intimidating at first, its easier than ever to start, now that over 30 of the network's shows are streaming on Peacock. I'm no mathematician, but I'm pretty sure that means you have...let's carry the 1...approximately 45,323 hours of Bravo's finest programming available right at your fingertips. I've bravely taken on the tough task of ranking 30 Bravo shows, from add-it-to-your-queue good to fake-a-sick-day-so-you-can-devour-the-whole-series GOOD.\n\nSo, as Countess Luann de Lesseps would say, \"Be cool, don't be all uncool,\" and join me on this journey.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bravo1-661ecf15966bc.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*",
