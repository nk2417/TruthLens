He didn\u2019t come to Indio by his lonesome, however, as his set featured special guests Dr. Dre and 50 Cent. Skylar Grey and Bebe Rexha also dropped in.\n\nDre and Em delivered collaborative renditions of \u201cStill D.R.E.\u201d, \u201cNothin\u2019 but a G Thang\u201d, 2Pac\u2019s \u201cCalifornia Love\u201d, and \u201cForgot About Dre\u201d. Meanwhile, 50 Cent brought out a medley of songs which included hits \u201cIn Da Club\u201d and \u201cMy Life\u201d. Grey provided vocals for Dido on \u201cStan\u201d, Beyonc\u00e9 on \u201cWalk on Water\u201d, and Rihanna on \u201cLove the Way You Lie\u201d. Rexha replaced RiRi on \u201cThe Monster\u201d. Interestingly enough, both Rihanna and Beyonc\u00e9 (obviously) were in attendance this weekend and in theory could\u2019ve participated in Em\u2019s set.\n\n(Read: Eminem on Trump: \u201cA Fucking Turd Would Have Been a Better President)\n\nRelated Video\n\nCheck out fan-caught clips below as Em\u2019s set was not part of Coachella\u2019s official YouTube live stream.\n\nEminem\u2019s last album was the disappointing 2017 record, Revival.", "images":
