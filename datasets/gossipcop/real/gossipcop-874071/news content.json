(They are already parents of Daughter Nova, 2.)\n\n\u201cIt was one of those things where my husband and I were so excited to have just one kid,\u201d the New York City native said. \u201cWe have a beautiful daughter, Nova. She\u2019s awesome \u2014 named after the Chevy, obviously. It\u2019s also celestial, but you know what I mean \u2014 more so the Chevy. We were so excited to travel the world. We were like, \u2018We\u2019re going to be modern. We don\u2019t have to have two kids.'\u201d\n\nWhen the late-night host, 49, asked why the couple\u2019s plans had changed, the actress quipped, \u201cWe had sexual intercourse.\u201d\n\nAnd while the proud parents are elated over their new addition, the What Happens In Vegas actress said their daughter is having a difficult time welcoming her baby brother.\n\nRelated: Celeb Moms Share Breastfeeding Pictures Mom power!

She\u2019s having trouble with it.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Bell says Ozzy has changed her life \u201cso vastly\u201d since his arrival. \u201cThere\u2019s so much wrangling and so many logistics. Your marriage turns into just a logistics conversation. The other day \u2014 and I promise this is without hyperbole; this really happened\u2014we were going through our schedules,\u201d she told Kimmel. \u201cSo, we really made a moment in our schedule to plan our schedule.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars \u2014 They\u2019re Just Like Us!
