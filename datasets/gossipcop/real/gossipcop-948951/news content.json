Confidential,\u201d and Pearce suggests in a new interview with Australian talk show host Andrew Denton that Spacey got inappropriate with him during production. Spacey has been accused of sexual harassment and abuse by serval men, including \u201cStar Trek: Discovery\u201d and \u201cRent\u201d actor Anthony Rapp.\n\nDuring the interview, Pearce was asked about Spacey\u2019s history of abuse and working with the actor early in their careers. Pearce did not want to reveal too much about his experiences with Spacey, but he did imply nonprofessional behavior when he said, \u201cYeah. Tough one to talk about at the moment. Amazing actor, incredible actor. Mmm. Slightly difficult time with Kevin, yeah.\u201d\n\nPearce followed the comment with the following remark, \u201cHe\u2019s a handsy guy. Thankfully I was 29, and not 14.\u201d According to Yahoo Entertainment, Denton\u2019s audience could be heard gasping at Pearce\u2019s revelation.\n\nPearce\u2019s implication would not be the first time a high profile actor has come forward to reveal Spacey\u2019s behavior on set. Gabriel Byrne said last December that Spacey\u2019s \u201csexually inappropriate behavior\u201d stopped production on \u201cThe Usual Suspects.\u201d The film\u2019s director, Bryan Singer, refuted the claim.\n\n\u201cI did not know honestly then the extent of his violence,\u201d Byrne told The Sunday Times. \u201cI mean, he was kind of a joke in that people would say, \u2018That\u2019s Kevin,\u2019 but nobody really understood the depth of his predations. It was only years later that we began to understand that [filming] was closed down for a particular reason and that was because of inappropriate sexual behavior by Spacey.\u201d\n\nIn the months since the first allegation against Spacey was made, the actor has remained entirely out of the spotlight. Spacey was fired from his Netflix series \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d which will return for a final season with co-star Robin Wright in the lead role. The actor is still set to appear in the film \u201cBillionaire Boys Club,\u201d which opens in theaters August 17.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/charli.png?resize=232,175", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/R1406_FEA_VOICES_C.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AAAAOlIZ4SiFmaNYP7VafZR7f3LACEKCaFqOgtdWx6vC99RI24WvVTcDK4Dbx8kM5mvFGUwM2zK27YCgj7gYGn26g4bVw9kbw9cyyg0TRBGM0sxMR_gmnlRg4ouL9GztVTum3QWfqBYyoZHxtVM.dyn_.jpeg?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7155.jpg?w=3000&h=2656&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TNB_05859_R-H-2024-1.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Screen-Shot-2018-07-03-at-10.27.51-AM.png?w=780", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7417.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/anaconda.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/john-and-yoko.jpg?w=770&h=980&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thoughts-and-prayers-hbo.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Zack-Sharf.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Sac_Sabonis.png?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/P101KRNG.jpg?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple_TV_Your_Friends_and_Neighbors_key_art_graphic_header_16_9_show_home.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/3-JUST-IN-TIME-Jonathan-Groff-Photo-by-Matthew-Murphy-and-Evan-Zimmerman.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2246549744.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_9197762y.jpg?w=3000&h=1687&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-01-at-8.32.46\u202fPM.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_9197762y.jpg?w=650", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7173.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-Lowdown-Ethan-Hawke-interview.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/shutterstock_9197762y.jpg?w=650", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zack Sharf"], "canonical_link": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/guy-pearce-kevin-spacey-handsy-l-a-confidential-set-1201980737/", "title": "Guy Pearce Says Kevin Spacey Was \u2018a Handsy Guy\u2019 on \u2018L.A.
