Larry David added, \u201cAs I\u2019ve said many times, when one has the opportunity to annoy someone, one should do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d returned this year for a ninth season following a six year absence from television. The new season of the comedy series was nominated this week for two SAG Awards, including outstanding male performer in a comedy series for David, and outstanding ensemble in a comedy.

Smoove, Cheryl Hines, Richard Lewis, Bob Einstein, Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen.\n\nIn her review of the new season for Variety, Sonia Saraiya wrote, \u201cThe primary takeaway from \u2018Curb Your Enthusiasm\u2019s\u2019 long-awaited ninth-season premiere, \u2018Foisted!,\u2019 is that the show \u2014 its style, its characters, its tone \u2014 is almost exactly what it was when it aired its Season 8 finale in 2011. It\u2019s welcome, but a little strange, too.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d was created by David and is executive produced by Larry David, Jeff Garlin, and Jeff Schaffer.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/curb-your-enthusiasm.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/curb-your-enthusiasm.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Holloway", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/curb-your-enthusiasm-8-1202641060/", "title": "\u2018Curb Your Enthusiasm\u2019 to Return for Season 10", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Larry David's \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" has been renewed for a 10th season on HBO.
