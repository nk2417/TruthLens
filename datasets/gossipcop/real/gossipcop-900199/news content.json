In the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration last January, women flooded Washington wearing pink pussycat hats to march on the Capitol. In September, celebrities made a political statement at the 2017 Emmys by wearing blue ACLU ribbons after Trump announced his plans to end DACA.\n\nBut perhaps this year\u2019s Golden Globes could thread Hollywood\u2019s largest display of solidarity as some of the biggest names in show business pledge to don black at the 75th annual event.\n\nWith the influx of sexual misconduct allegations in entertainment \u2014 and other industries \u2014 since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke in October, stars of the big and small screen are planning to wear all black to the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles this Sunday in support of those who have spoken out about sexual harassment and to protest gender inequality.\n\nAlong with the dark ensembles, participants will reportedly be accessorizing with pins created by Time\u2019s Up \u2014 the coalition behind the statement.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nMichael Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock\n\nShonda Rhimes, Reese Witherspoon, and 300 other prominent women in the entertainment industry are behind the Time\u2019s Up initiative aimed at eradicating abuse, harassment, marginalization and underrepresentation in the work place.\n\nThe alliance almost decided to boycott the Golden Globe Awards entirely, Kerry Washington told the LA Times. But the group eventually decided against it, suggesting that it was important to support their peers who were nominated.\n\nInstead, an agreement was made to wear all black, with the hopes that this unified stand would prompt a larger discussion from the red carpet, leveraging the access to millions of viewers tuned in to watch the awards show, both on camera and online, with the hashtag #WhyWeWearBlack.\n\n\u201cWearing black is an opportunity to talk about all the other things that we\u2019re doing,\u201d Washington explained to the Times. \u201cWe\u2019re saying that we are three-dimensional, fully realized human beings as women. We are participants in this entertainment industry, and we have something to say.\u201d\n\nDespite the all-black attire creating a seemingly similar aesthetic, Cristina Ehrlich, whose clients include Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Greta Gerwig, Laura Dern, Alison Brie, Allison Williams, and Tina Fey, said her clients will still be telling a unique story through fashion.\n\n\u201cPeople aren\u2019t using words anymore like, \u2018I want to look sexy.\u2019 It\u2019s more about, \u2018I want to look like I\u2019m a woman of power. I want to look like a woman who is standing my ground,'\u201d Ehrlich told Variety earlier this week.\n\nSeveral women have even requested to wear female designers, she added.\n\n\u201cBecause [the Globes] is international and it\u2019s the Hollywood Foreign Press, you really want these women to have a moment that is going to strike as many different audiences as you can,\u201d she said.\n\nStylist Ilaria Urbanati, who works with Dwayne Johnson, Tom Hiddleston, and Armie Hammer, posted about the protest on Instagram in December and confirmed her male clients will be wearing black in unity with women.\n\n\u201cSafe to say this may not be the right time to choose to be the odd man out here,\u201d she wrote.\n\nTo the critics who argued that #WhyWeWearBlack wouldn\u2019t be an effective demonstration, actress Rashida Jones says they\u2019re missing the point entirely.\n\n\u201cThis is not a silent protest,\u201d the actress told InStyle. \u201cWe wear black to stand in solidarity with our sisters and to say time\u2019s up on this imbalance of power and the abuses that come with it, regardless of what industry you work in. It\u2019s time for every workplace to look more like our world, where women have equal representation.\u201d Online, fellow actors Ashley Judd and Tessa Thompson tweeted their support of Jones\u2019 statements.\n\nViewers will get to see that online solidarity in action on the red carpet Sunday night.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/triptico_1515370413962.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/triptico_1515370413962.jpg?w=1000&h=667&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/triptico_1515370413962.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Rubin", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/golden-globes-sexual-harassment-protest-black-dresses-1202654958/", "title": "Why Stars Are Wearing All Black to the Golden Globes", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Men and women in Hollywood have planned to silently protest sexual harassment with black dresses on the Golden Globes red carpet.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Rebecca Rubin", "tags": "Golden Globes, Time's Up", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Why Stars Are Wearing All Black to the Golden Globes", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/golden-globes-sexual-harassment-protest-black-dresses-1202654958/", "description": "Men and women in Hollywood have planned to silently protest sexual harassment with black dresses on the Golden Globes red carpet.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/triptico_1515370413962.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Golden Globes Red Carpet: Stars Plan to Protest With Black Dresses"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-06T18:17:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-01T23:51:09+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Men and women in Hollywood have planned to silently protest sexual harassment with black dresses on the Golden Globes red carpet.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@rebeccaarubin", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why Stars Are Wearing All Black to the Golden Globes", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/triptico_1515370413962.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515262671.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
