A time when we didn't have the threat of nuclear war with North Korea, Fuller House didn't exist, and Kim Kardashian was all about selfies. That last one is particularly important. Kim loved selfies back then\u2014well, she loved them before that too. This is a woman who, when faced with the prospect of her sister going to jail, took photos of herself. A woman who announced to the world she's voting for Hillary Clinton via selfie. A woman who didn't let an elephant's rogue trunk get in the way of the perfect photo. She quite literally published a 448-page book about selfies. I'm not kidding. 448 pages. Of just selfies. Called Selfish.\n\nAnd now that same woman is denouncing the art form she commodified. Yes, my friends, Kim Kardashian just announced that selfies are O-V-E-R. If that's not a sign the world is up in flames, I don't know what is. We now live in an era when, if Khlo\u00e9 goes to jail, Kim would be a supportive sister. What fresh hell is this?\n\nKim dropped this bombshell while playing a game of \"Would You Rather?\" with, ironically, Khlo\u00e9. When Khlo\u00e9 asked Kim to choose between never posting a selfie again or never Snapchatting again, she (blasphemously) picked the former.\n\n\"I would rather never be able to post a selfie again. Take a selfie,\" Kim, who once went out of her way to vogue behind a stranger's selfie, said. \"I kinda feel like selfies are kind of a few years ago.\"", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/6883ef8475f8cc4034148a50/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691ca6075dbfbce9d766d347/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/thegiftshop.svg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_640%2Cq_80%2Cw_640/v1507235422/glamour_7-sneaker-trends-you-ll-see-this-fall.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690e460e839f3ecee7a0b476/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6902283d601dff04f14d5bc6/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691346d59a4ea3b29e90544b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/67a23d1cd1380148e0159eab/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6903b5c553adbbd18445744c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5e4967dcc142f40008ca7346/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68b9faaa2a7a237b55977c35/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/620d55d803e4447bb1303cbe/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/logo-oneNav.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59dd27657eb3f37b677c9b26/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/KIM-KARDASHIAN.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59dd27657eb3f37b677c9b26/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/KIM-KARDASHIAN.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6913ad6972a856e01633db66/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59dd27657eb3f37b677c9b26/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/KIM-KARDASHIAN.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher Rosa"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/kim-kardashian-says-selfies-are-over", "title": "Kim Kardashian Says Selfies Are Over, so I Guess the Internet's Canceled", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Christopher Rosa", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Kim Kardashian, who literally wrote the book on selfies, says selfies are over.
