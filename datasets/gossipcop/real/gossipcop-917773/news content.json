The actress has always looked good, but at 51 she looks freaking amazing (and definitely defies the normal science of aging). Now, her trainer is spilling what\u2019s behind Halle's toned, fit physique.\n\nPeter Lee Thomas has been working with Halle for about two years, and told People she\u2019s super committed to fitness.\n\n\u201cI had no idea what her age was when I met her. I never looked or was interested in that, and when I found out, I was absolutely shell-shocked because she has the discipline and athleticism of a 25-year old.\"\n\nSo, Thomas did what any good trainer would do, and decided to challenge Halle even more, with a combination of exercises like martial arts, boxing, yoga and \u201ca lot of military training [like] the Navy Seals would do.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Halle is so awesome at working out, that Thomas said she could \u201cvery easily transition\u201d into becoming a professional athlete if she wanted to.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s also not afraid to experiment and explore and take risks when it comes to fitness,\" Thomas said, \"because she understands that in order for there to be potential growth and change, she\u2019s going to have to do things that are commonly difficult to do.\"\n\nThomas, who trains Halle five days a week, revealed to People he surprises her with something new every day. \u201cI bring a constellation of things,\u201d he said. \u201cThat, in itself, is quite challenging because she has to be ready almost on improv. It can break a lot of people, who don\u2019t see the workout the day prior.\u201d\n\nOf course, what she eats matters, too. According to Thomas, Halle follows the keto diet.\n\nAnd based on her social media presence, Halle is proud of what she can do. She offers up her own weekly #FitnessFriday workout tips on Instagram, like the importance of stretching:\n\nOr how to get the motivation to start working out:\n\nPlus, she even shares some of the workout moves she and Thomas do together, both via posts and in her story.\n\nBottom line: Halle works hard for that body\u2014and it shows.", "images":
