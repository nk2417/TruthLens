He is the opposite of Scott. He doesn\u2019t party, isn\u2019t flashy and really treats Kourtney with a lot of respect. It\u2019s obvious that he really cares about Kourtney.\u201d\n\nIf that weren\u2019t enough, Bendjima seems to have gotten the ultimate seal of a approval: an invitation to spend Christmas with the KarJenners.\n\n\u201cYounes will be in L.A. for Christmas and is invited to celebrate with Kourtney\u2019s family,\u201d the source says.\n\nSplash News Online\n\nYounes Bendjima and Kourtney Kardashian\n\nKardashian\u2019s relationship with Bendjima has been a point of contention between her and Disick, 34, on this season of KUWTK. In a November episode, Kardashian finally went public with the romance while in Cannes in May \u2014 and Disick responded by threatening his ex and flying to the south of France himself, where he was seen canoodling with multiple women.\n\n\u201cI got defensive,\u201d he admitted during a confessional. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be in Cannes with another guy, like, have fun. But just know that it\u2019s probably not going to be that fun if you run into me.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s allowed to live her life, she\u2019s a single girl,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe all know that I do what I want, so she should be able to also. But there\u2019s a lot of anger. It\u2019s really real, us not being together.\u201d\n\nKardashian, however, called the trip \u201cso fun\u201d and, most importantly, incredibly \u201cfreeing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not trying to throw anything in anyone\u2019s face,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m also not going to hide.\u201d\n\nYounes Bendjima and Kourtney Kardashian\n\nKourtney played coy about her relationship status on an episode of KUWTK earlier this month \u2014 telling sisters Kim Kardashian West, 37, and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, 33, that she doesn\u2019t \u201cgo on dates\u201d when they tried to set her up with someone in order for her to finally spill the details about Bendjima.\n\n\u201c[We saw you] out with a certain someone,\u201d Kim said, wondering about Bendjima.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s your boyfriend?\u201d Khlo\u00e9 pressed Kourtney. \u201cSo you just hang out with this guy, but you won\u2019t validate anything to us?\u201d\n\nDespite the pressure, Kourtney stayed silent. But Kim and Khlo\u00e9 still interpreted her non-interest in meeting someone else as confirmation that she and Bendjima are in a relationship.\n\n\u201cShe fully does not go for it,\u201d Kim explained, \u201cso she definitely has a boyfriend.\u201d", "images":
