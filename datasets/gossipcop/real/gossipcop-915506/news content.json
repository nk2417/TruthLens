Songz allegedly became angry with the woman after watching her engage with another man. A hearing has been set for March 27.\n\n\u201cWe took this step today to protect my client\u2019s rights to peacefully live and work, and we will continue to fully cooperate with law enforcement\u2019s investigation of this serious matter,\u201d said Lisa Bloom, who is representing the woman, in a statement. \u201cThe room was filled with Mr. Songz\u2019 friends and employees. We are asking just one of them with a conscience to reach out to us and tell us what they saw. Don\u2019t be a bystander to violence against women.\u201d\n\nSongz has had a few legal run-ins in the past. Last August, the singer pled guilty to two misdemeanors stemming from a December concert where the singer was accused of damaging property and throwing objects off the stage after concert organizers asked the singer to end his set. Shortly after in December, Songz was also accused of attacking a fan who said the singer knocked her cell phone to the ground after requesting to take a photo.\n\nBillboard reached out to Songz\u2019s rep for comment.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/trey-songz-meek-mill-hoodie-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=628&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/trey-songz-meek-mill-hoodie-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/trey-songz-meek-mill-hoodie-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nerisha Penrose", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/pro/trey-songz-assault-victim-temporary-restraining-order/", "title": "Trey Songz Alleged Assault Victim Granted Temporary Restraining Order", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Trey Songz's alleged assault victim was granted a temporary restraining order against the singer.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Nerisha Penrose", "tags": "bbnews", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Trey Songz Alleged Assault Victim Granted Temporary Restraining Order", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/pro/trey-songz-assault-victim-temporary-restraining-order/", "description": "Trey Songz's alleged assault victim was granted a temporary restraining order against the singer.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/trey-songz-meek-mill-hoodie-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Trey Songz, 2017"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-07T16:13:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-07T19:33:45+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trey Songz's alleged assault victim was granted a temporary restraining order against the singer.", "site": "@billboard", "creator": "@NerishaPenrose", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Trey Songz Alleged Assault Victim Granted Temporary Restraining Order", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/trey-songz-meek-mill-hoodie-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520439192.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
