Read at your own risk!\n\nWell\u2026 after multiple apocalypses, nuclear wars, and environmental disasters, it\u2019s finally time to leave the ravaged and barren trash planet once known as Earth behind. In the season 5 finale of the CW\u2019s The 100, Clarke (Eliza Taylor), Bellamy (Bob Morley), and the survivors of the human race made it off the planet just in time to escape nuclear fallout.\n\nBut their plan to go to cryo-sleep and wake up when Earth is habitable again failed, and Monty (Christopher Larkin) secretly charted a new course for his sleeping friends after figuring out the Eligius\u2019s real mission: to find and settle on a different planet light-years away, nestled in a binary star system. And so, when Clarke and Bellamy wake, they find themselves headed for a completely new home \u2014 a home that may not be ready for them to call it home just yet.\n\nBelow, The 100 showrunner Jason Rothenberg discusses how the writers decided to move on from Earth entirely; where Clarke, Bellamy, and Octavia (Marie Avgeropoulos) can go from here; and what \u201cEnd of Book One\u201d meant for the series.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What inspired this ending, to leap forward 125 years, to lose Monty and Harper, to introduce us to their son, and to effectively start all over, but with a new planet and two suns?\n\nJASON ROTHENBERG: There was a confluence of things we were trying to solve. One of them was we didn\u2019t know whether it was going to be a season or a series finale, so I needed the ending to be a satisfying piece of storytelling, and at the same time tee up something that was really mysterious and enticing for the audience and, to be honest with you, for the powers that be at the network and studio.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the dance, from an inside-baseball perspective. But [our narrative] threads \u2014 the spaceship with cryo-sleep on it that had come back from an interstellar mission, the two armies fighting over this one valley \u2014 naturally led us to this idea of going to explore another world. It was in the DNA of The 100 that when we say something bad\u2019s gonna happen, it happens. So as I was breaking the season with the writers last year, they were like, \u201cWe have to destroy the Valley.\u201d That just made the most logical sense.\n\nRight, humans would squabble over something so pivotal that they end up destroying it. Was that what you were hoping people took away from this ending?\n\nYeah. I mean, we\u2019re all on this planet together, and yet we don\u2019t care what we\u2019re doing to the atmosphere. One of the things we were trying to say \u2014 and it\u2019s a little bit of a nihilistic opinion of the human race \u2014 is that man couldn\u2019t overcome their innate instincts to make war.\n\nThe last shot has a card saying, \u201cEnd of Book One.\u201d We\u2019ve never seen anything like that before \u2014 what did you mean by that?\n\nIt also could have said, \u201cEnd of Planet One.\u201d We have the opportunity to create a new world, literally in this case, and it\u2019s a binary star system, so we\u2019re gonna play with what that means in an interesting way. There\u2019s definitely life on that planet. We can see that from space in the finale.\n\nBattlestar Galactica is a huge influence of mine, and so is Interstellar, and I was also really influenced by the movie Annihilation, which I thought was great. It\u2019s inspiring us. The idea is we can really do anything, because life takes endless forms and environmental threats can come from anywhere. Some of it is beautiful and some of it isn\u2019t, just like on our planet.\n\nInteresting! And what are you calling the planet?\n\nI can\u2019t tell you \u2014 that\u2019s a spoiler for next season. But we are going in search of Eligius III, with the hope that Eligius III made it to this planet and populated it and were able to survive. We\u2019ll join what is essentially the next outpost for humanity. The story for season 6 is in many ways about what happened to Eligius III and how we interact with what happened to Eligius III. Are there survivors? What are the threats in the woods? Are there woods here? Are there things that don\u2019t exist on Earth? You better believe there are. We\u2019re going to really lean into sci-fi world-building with this planet.\n\nDiyah Pera/The CW\n\nSadly, in order for the survivors to find this new planet, Monty and Harper had to say goodbye. How did actors Christopher Larkin and Chelsey Reist react to leaving their characters behind?\n\nIt\u2019s always hard to write a character that\u2019s beloved off a show, and in this case two of them. Chris and I had big, long conversations about it before we started \u2014 I have sit-downs with all the series regulars at the start of the season \u2014 but Chelsey, who wasn\u2019t a series regular but was certainly a huge part of our show\u2019s family, when I finally figured out what the ending was going to be, I called her.\n\nShe was on her way to work, and I remember she kind of knew what the call was about \u2014 they all know when that call comes in, it\u2019s not like we talk on the phone very often \u2014 and she had to pull over. She was sad, and it was a hard conversation, but then I pitched her what it was, and I sensed a shift in her on that call. Like, she realized how potentially powerful and emotional and beautiful it would be, giving these two people a happily-ever-after, which is not something the show traffics in, you know? And once we started doing it, it was the most emotional day I\u2019ve ever experienced on set. I think it was for everybody involved.\n\nIt\u2019s a shock for Bellamy and Clarke, certainly, but at least they\u2019ve reconciled. What is their dynamic going to be like going forward? In a way, they now have Madi and Jordan to take care of as, like, their kids.\n\n[Laughs] That\u2019s a funny way to think about that. Jordan is a child in many ways, even though biologically he\u2019s as old as they are, but he\u2019s experienced nothing. Madi\u2019s far more developed emotionally. And Bellamy and Clarke have always been the center of the show, and their relationship is so important to everything we do. When they\u2019re in alignment and have the same goal, things work out; when they\u2019re on opposite sides, it\u2019s usually a s\u2014show. [Laughs]\n\nSo right now, they\u2019re back to being in alignment, but a lot of other characters are not going to forgive Clarke as readily as Bellamy has, and that is something we\u2019re going to keep an eye on as season 6 begins. But they will go forward with Monty\u2019s wish for them to do better. They\u2019ll be committed to that course \u2014 Clarke, I think, even more strongly than Bellamy going forward.\n\nWhat makes their relationship so unique at this point in the series?\n\nAt the moment, they\u2019re in their development as people. They are partners, and sometimes I say they\u2019re best friends. They\u2019re certainly not romantic yet. I think personally that that is unique and rare and different than what you normally see in opposite-sex leading roles in television shows, you know? And obviously a lot of people in our fandom still ask that question and yearn for that, and I get that and appreciate that and love that they watch the show, but I can\u2019t make any promises one way or another. Where they are right now is my favorite place for them to be, which is non-romantic partners and soulmates aligned, going in the same direction.\n\nDiyah Pera/The CW\n\nBellamy and Octavia, though, still have a ways to go. What kept you from giving them a scene where they completely patched things up?\n\nI feel like that relationship took a while to break, and it\u2019s going to take a while for it to recover. Octavia has not yet really reconciled with what she\u2019s done. She was going to sacrifice herself for them, and she got that taken away from her. On some level, we\u2019re going to play with this a lot in season 6. She\u2019s kind of pissed off and still bitter that people don\u2019t accept that she did keep them alive, that she took on all of that misery so the people in the bunker wouldn\u2019t break. To me, she\u2019s going to need to come out of that on the other side before Bellamy can fully accept her.\n\nAlso, part of Bellamy\u2019s journey is that [his sister] was always his touchstone. No matter what he did, we were going to forgive him because it was for her, for the sister he loved, and we loved. He needs to move on from that too \u2014 that\u2019s not owning your own life \u2014 so he needs to figure out who he is independent of that. The two of them need to come back together and have a grown-up relationship. He\u2019s lived as her father his whole life, but he\u2019s her brother, and she\u2019s her own person too. That\u2019s where the journey begins for them next season.\n\nNow, just to clarify: Is McCreary dead?\n\nClarke squashed his melon, but that said, you didn\u2019t see a body at the end. So\u2026 I suppose the door is open.\n\nUh oh. What about Kane? He\u2019s in a medically induced coma, and actor Henry Ian Cusick is on a new series. Should we brace ourselves for an exit?\n\nI think it\u2019s too early to say. For sure he\u2019s in The 100 next season as we begin the journey, and I love him as an actor and what he\u2019s brought to the show. He\u2019ll always be a core member of The 100 family, and we\u2019re going to figure out [his schedule].\n\nWhat about Diyoza and her baby? Her fetus is now, what, the oldest fetus in the world?\n\nIt\u2019s 200 years old! [Laughs] Two hundred years old and five months. And yes, everybody who\u2019s alive at the end of season 5 is in season 6.\n\nFianlly, with the \u201cEnd of Book One\u201d card and this reset in mind, how long do you see The 100 going on for?\n\nThe truth is that I used to have an ending in mind, but we passed that ending a while ago, and yet the show keeps staying, for me, creatively challenging and exciting. As long as it is that for me, I will stay on this show, and the show will stay on the air, given [the CW boss] Mark Pedowitz\u2019s desires. For me, shows should have an ending, and they should not go on forever, and when you start repeating yourself too much, then that\u2019s time to walk away. But at this point, that\u2019s one of the reasons we put \u201cEnd of Book One\u201d on that screen, because it really is the end of one adventure and the beginning of another.", "images":
