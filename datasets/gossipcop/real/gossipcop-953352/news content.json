So does getting Kevin Hart to take back a loan!\n\nIn 2017, Tiffany Haddish went from a struggling actor to an overnight sensation thanks to her hilarious performance in the film Girls Trip. And now Haddish is looking to pay back the people who helped her along the way -- namely Hart.\n\nBack in the day, Hart loaned Haddish $300, all the money he had on him at the time, when he discovered she was living in her car. Now, the 38-year-old actress is working hard to return the money. Really hard.\n\nHart just posted a video of his Night School co-star dumping dollar bills on him during an interview on set. \u201cI love my sister @tiffanyhaddish ....She has been trying to pay me back for years & I refused to take the money so she ambushed me on set and made it rain on me.\u201d\n\nHart went on to add that \u201cwhat she doesn\u2019t know is that I put the money back in one of her wig caps that she wasn\u2019t wearing later that day!!!! I\u2019m dead serious. Check your wig cap @tiffanyhaddish ....I love u and I will never take from you. You being my Co-Star in my movie \u201cNight School\u201d was more than enough. Love u with ur funky a**!!!!\u201d\n\nNaturally, this led to a post from Haddish in which she discovered the money right where Hart said it was. \u201cAm I gonna have to fight you to give you this money back!\u201d she responded. \u201cDon\u2019t make me have to roll up on your baby mama and drop it in her purse.\u201d\n\nBack in June, Hart discussed the day he helped his friend during an interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.\n\n\"I was nowhere near Kevin Hart today and in my pocket I had $300 and I was like, 'Here. I don't know what your situation is, but hopefully this can do something for you in this time because I feel like you're not telling me something,'\" the 38-year-old comedian shared.\n\nLearn more about Haddish and Hart\u2019s friendship in the clip below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/thad_khart.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-07/tiff.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-07/tiffanyhaddish_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-07/tiffany_haddish_leonardo_dicaprio_gettyimages.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2014-03/set_the_signal_ver2_xlg.jpg?width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/thad_khart.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/thad_khart.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/kevin-hart-refuses-to-let-tiffany-haddish-pay-back-300-life-changing-loan-106366", "title": "Kevin Hart Refuses to Let Tiffany Haddish Pay Back $300 Life-Changing Loan", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/thad_khart.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 'Night School' actress is determined to pay back her longtime friend.", "title": "Kevin Hart Refuses to Let Tiffany Haddish Pay Back $300 Life-Changing Loan", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kevin-hart-refuses-to-let-tiffany-haddish-pay-back-300-life-changing-loan-106366", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 'Night School' actress is determined to pay back her longtime friend.", "twitter": {"description": "The 'Night School' actress is determined to pay back her longtime friend.", "title": "Kevin Hart Refuses to Let Tiffany Haddish Pay Back $300 Life-Changing Loan", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kevin-hart-refuses-to-let-tiffany-haddish-pay-back-300-life-changing-loan-106366", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/thad_khart.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Kevin Hart Refuses to Let Tiffany Haddish Pay Back $300 Life-Changing Loan | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, Movies, News, Kevin Hart, Tiffany Haddish", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
