It\u2019s not in my hands anymore so I\u2019m just sitting back and letting it all unfold.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about their love in 2016, Gigi said: \u201cFor the first time, we are both in a relationship where we have very similar interests outside of work and that is really important.\n\n\u201cWe cook a lot together and do art together and we\u2019re each other\u2019s best friends. We both feel we can talk about anything and learn a lot from one another.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday Zayn confirmed the Sun\u2019s story in a statement posted on Twitter.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cGigi and I had an incredibly meaningful, loving and fun relationship and I have a huge amount of respect and adoration for Gigi as a woman and a friend.\n\n\u201cShe has such an incredible soul. I\u2019m grateful to all of our fans for respecting this difficult decision and our privacy at this time, we wish this news could have come from us first.\n\n\u201cWe love you all. xZ\u201d\n\nSoon after Gigi added her own Twitter statement.\n\nShe wrote: \u201cBreakup statements often seem impersonal because there is really no way to put into words what two people experience together over a few years .. not only in the relationship, but in life in general.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m forever grateful for the love, time, and life lessons that Z and I shared. I want nothing but the best for him and will continue to support him as a friend that I have immense respect and love for.\n\n\u201cAs for the future, whatever\u2019s meant to be will always be. xG\u201d\n\nhttps://twitter.com/GiGiHadid/status/973640377839374337", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000389715634.jpg?strip=all&w=642", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/image-f9d8c614cf.jpg?quality=90&strip=all", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/I-Swear-Landscape-Quad-UK-UK-Localised-English-6000x4500-ISwear-QUAD-Dated-HR-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/crop-37379919.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000339600495.jpg?strip=all&w=680", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000338543632.jpg?strip=all&w=701", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000305526652.jpg?strip=all&w=739", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/crop-37387356.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000286877379.jpg?strip=all&w=640", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000389597101.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/newspress-collage-i79lfcufo-1763655265039.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1763655297&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000318941761.jpg?strip=all&w=537", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000391966330.jpg?strip=all&w=750", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rb-composite-gigi-broken.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000377866535.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000211518075.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000274457677.jpg?strip=all&w=641", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000285884463.jpg?strip=all&w=768"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/rb-composite-gigi-broken.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/5797088/zayn-malik-gigi-hadid-split/", "title": "Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid split after more than two years together", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
