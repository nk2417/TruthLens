The Oscar winner gave her side of the story during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen on Sunday, July 23.\n\nBack in 2014, the Sister, Sister alum allegedly told InTouch that she was snubbed by the Atomic Blonde actress. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t very nice to me. I said, \u2018Hi,\u2019 and she actually rolled her eyes and said, \u2018Oh my God,\u2019\u201d Mowry, now 39, told the magazine at the time. \u201cI wasn\u2019t over-the-top. I know how to approach another celebrity. Charlize was just mean. I\u2019m just being honest.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: Celebrity Feuds: The Biggest Ever!

Whether it\u2019s assuming the downward dog position, hitting the pavement or lifting weights, stars enjoy shedding pounds with their famous acquaintances by their side. Reese Witherspoon, for example, goes on hikes with her [\u2026]\n\n\u201cWell you can\u2019t go by that,\u201d Theron said of the false story. \u201cI\u2019m really nice at SoulCycle actually, because once my endorphins kick in I\u2019m actually almost too friendly. I\u2019m always touching people, like, \u2018Hey!\u2019\u201d\n\nShe added that she doesn\u2019t even remember seeing the The Game actress at SoulCycle. \u201cI\u2019m not an eye roller, but I would be like f\u2013k off,\u201d she said.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
