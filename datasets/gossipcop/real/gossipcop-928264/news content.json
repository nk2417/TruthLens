I\u2019m a perfectionist, so I look a little bit critically,\u201d Turner recently told BBC. \u201cBut when I look and see it done so well, I feel proud.\u201d\n\nBefore marrying Bach five years ago, Turner experienced a tumultuous marriage to Ike Turner from 1962 to 1978. The singer said she has since forgiven her former spouse for years of physical abuse.\n\n\u201cAs an old person, I have forgiven him, but it would not work with him,\u201d Turner told The Sunday Times earlier this year. \u201cHe asked for one more tour with me, and I said, \u2018No, absolutely not.\u2019 Ike wasn\u2019t someone you could forgive and allow him back in. It\u2019s all gone, all forgotten.\u201d\n\nTurner is currently working on her second memoir, the follow up to 1986\u2019s \u201cI, Tina: My Life Story.\u201d", "images": ["https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/tina-turner-at-tina-musical-opening.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=664", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F100-live-115674573.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115743727.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115485559.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/kevin-spacey-reveals-homeless-living-115762000.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/fergie.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115752191.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fjones-road-black-friday-sale.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1763551750&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fbethenny-frankels-gift-picks-include-115619188.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115742458.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/fergie.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/kevin-spacey-reveals-homeless-living-115762000.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115723827.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115733621.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/minka-kelly-jenna-bush-hager.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/tina-turner-adrienne-warren-tina-turner-musical.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115723827.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/tina-turner-musical-red-carpet-index.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115742458.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115731438.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2FCMA.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2FKrisJennersaystheseamazingPDRNproductshavebecomehernewessentials.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115757930.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/meghan-prince-harry-115747983.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/tina-turner-musical-red-carpet-index.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/04/19/tina-turner-walks-first-red-carpet-in-five-years/", "title": "Tina Turner walks first red carpet in five years", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
