There\u2019s something missing and I want to give you a housewarming gift so it\u2019s gonna go on that shelf,\u201d DeGeneres said before whipping out a shiny new Crock-Pot with a big red bow.\n\n\u201cI will remember to unplug this after I\u2019m done using it,\u201d Moore added with a laugh, referencing the kitchen appliance that played a part in the demise of her TV husband played by Milo Ventimiglia.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Mandy Moore on Working With Milo Ventimiglia on \u2018This Is Us\u2019: \u201cIt\u2019s Easy to Pretend to Be in Love With Him\u201d\n\nThe episode resulted in many devastated fans turning their backs on their Crock-Pots. To make good with the brand, This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman and Ventimiglia created a hilarious Super Bowl ad with the hashtag #CrockPotIsInnocent. Ventimiglia also stopped by DeGeneres\u2019 show to come to the tool\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cI think there was a lot of misdirected hate at a Crock-Pot as opposed to a faulty slow cooker from the past,\u201d he said in February. \u201cThe good news is it didn\u2019t slowly cook Jack.\u201d", "images":
