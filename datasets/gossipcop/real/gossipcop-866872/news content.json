But during his 2017 trial, an awful truth about Hayden came to light.\n\nAs The Advocate reported, he was first arrested for raping a preteen girl in 2014 after his assistant contacted the police. This led to a trial where the now-15-year-old testified that he had preyed on her repeatedly, beginning when she was only 11. She was joined on the stand by a 37-year-old woman who alleged that she had also been a victim of child sexual abuse by Hayden over two decades earlier, at the age of 12. His oldest daughter Stephanie, who had previously appeared with her father on \"Sons of Guns,\" later told Dr. Phil that he had sexually abused her as well, which led to another sex crime charge.\n\nAt the end of his trial, Hayden was found guilty of aggravated rape and forcible rape so he was sentenced to two simultaneous life sentences plus another 40 years in prison, ensuring that he would be spending the rest of his years in jail (via The Advocate). He later received a third life sentence in July 2017, which the assistant district attorney declared, per WAFB, would \"satisfy our obligation to the public for public safety to make sure that this defendant stays in jail for the rest of his life.\"\n\nIf you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
