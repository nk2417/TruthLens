However, the girlfriend refused to cooperate with police and those June 2017 charges were dropped.\n\nTMZ reports that the police report stated that Gordon struck his girlfriend in the face several times while they drove back from a bar. He also allegedly pulled her hair and threatened to crash the vehicle they were in. Another verbal altercation occurred at the couple\u2019s Florida home, at which point police were called. When law enforcement saw marks on the girlfriend\u2019s face, they arrested Gordon, even though the girlfriend refused to press charges.\n\nTrending Stories 2025 CMA Awards: The Complete Winners List \u2018Faith Is Under Attack': Nicki Minaj Spreads Misleading Information at the United Nations Neighbor Indicted in Murder of \u2018King of the Hill\u2019 Star Jonathan Joss Is This Mysterious U.K. Rapper Actually Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet?\n\nIn December, US Weekly wrote that Gordon had relocated to Florida and was working as a landscaper in the aftermath of a $36 million civil lawsuit against him in September 2016.\n\nAlthough Gordon was never charged in the July 2015 death of Bobbi Kristina Brown, he was found \u201clegally responsible\u201d for her fatal accident after he failed to appear at a pair of wrongful death civil lawsuit hearings.\n\nIn a recent Rolling Stone interview, Bobby Brown said that, despite the $36 million lawsuit, he felt as though justice for his daughter hadn\u2019t been served. \u201cIf he was locked up somewhere where somebody can rape him. That\u2019s just how I feel,\u201d Brown said. \u201cHe raped me by taking my daughter away.\u201d", "images": ["https://rolingstone-com.go-vip.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/inmatephoto-e6f798a4-26e3-4fad-b3eb-8aedf7665e8c.jpg", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-154592717-253f8043-596d-4e5c-8ebb-45f2ddae3b21.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-154592717-253f8043-596d-4e5c-8ebb-45f2ddae3b21.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Kreps", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bobbi-kristina-brown-boyfriend-nick-gordon-arrested-again-for-battery-204796/", "title": "Bobbi Kristina Brown Boyfriend Nick Gordon Arrested Again for Battery", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Nick Gordon, the former boyfriend of the Bobbi Kristina Brown, was arrested Saturday in Florida on a domestic violence charge.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Daniel Kreps", "tags": "Bobbi Kristina Brown, Bobby Brown", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Bobbi Kristina Brown Boyfriend Nick Gordon Arrested Again for Battery", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/bobbi-kristina-brown-boyfriend-nick-gordon-arrested-again-for-battery-204796/", "description": "Nick Gordon, the former boyfriend of the Bobbi Kristina Brown, was arrested Saturday in Florida on a domestic violence charge.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-154592717-253f8043-596d-4e5c-8ebb-45f2ddae3b21.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "width": 1600, "height": 900, "alt": "d"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-11T20:09:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T15:40:25+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nick Gordon, the former boyfriend of the Bobbi Kristina Brown, was arrested Saturday in Florida on a domestic violence charge.", "site": "@RollingStone", "creator": "@danielkreps", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Bobbi Kristina Brown Boyfriend Nick Gordon Arrested Again for Battery", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-154592717-253f8043-596d-4e5c-8ebb-45f2ddae3b21.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520798940.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
