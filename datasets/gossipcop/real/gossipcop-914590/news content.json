We kindly ask that you respect our privacy during this time as we navigate the next phase of our lives.\u201d\n\nGayheart, best known for films such as Jawbreaker and Scream 2, filed for divorce on Friday in Los Angeles according to court documents obtained by The Blast.\n\nGayheart cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for their split but did not say when they separated, instead the date of separation was listed as \u201cTBD.\u201d\n\nThe actress, 46, is requesting joint legal and physical custody of the couple\u2019s two daughters: 7-year-old Billie and 6-year-old Georgia.\n\nThe Jawbreaker star is also seeking spousal support, according to the divorce documents.\n\nGayheart and the former Grey\u2019s Anatomy star married in 2004 and have faced a number of challenges since then.\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\n\nIn 2009, an intimate video of Dane, Gayheart and another woman was released without their knowledge. Two years later, Dane entered into rehab for an addiction to painkillers following a sports injury.\n\nSpeaking to PEOPLE in 2014, the actor said, \u201cWe\u2019ve all made mistakes. My one regret is that I got the person I love most wrapped up in all that: Rebecca.\u201d\n\nOf his family life, Dane said he feels happiest when he\u2019s at home with them.\n\n\u201cI never had a family, and now I do,\u201d he said, noting his father died when he was 7. \u201cI know I\u2019m a very lucky guy.\u201d\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: Eric Dane Makes First Public Appearance Since Depression Battle Halted Production on His TNT Show\n\nLast year, he opened up about his battle with depression on the Today show where he spoke candidly about his struggles, which forced him to take a break from his TNT show The Last Ship.\n\n\u201cI took some time off \u2014 I was dealing with some depression, which was kind of odd to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt very conflicted about it because I didn\u2019t really feel like I had anything to be depressed about.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow I take a medication called Pristiq, which I thought just sounded like a good mood,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd the depression is gone.\u201d\n\nDane rose to fame as Dr. Mark Sloan in ABC\u2019s Grey\u2019s Anatomy. His character was killed off in 2012 after six years on the show.", "images":
