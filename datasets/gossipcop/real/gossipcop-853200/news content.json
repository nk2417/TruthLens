Well, at least it did on Tuesday night. Harry Styles continued his week-long residency on the CBS show, stepping out and pretending to be host, James Corden, delivering the opening monologue.\n\nStyles, 23, clad in a velvet green suit, touched on the news, poking fun at both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. But the British singer really enjoyed trying out puns while talking about the story involving hackers threatening to release Pirates of the Caribbean 5 unless a ransom was paid.\n\n\n\nWATCH: Harry Styles Dodges Kendall Jenner Mentions, Teases \u2018Carpool Karaoke\u2019 Segment on \u2018The Late Late Show\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThey could release this movie illegally. I guess you would say it\u2019s a pirated video,\u201d he quipped. \u201cThey\u2019re holding Pirates of the Caribbean for ransom. Sounds to me like they\u2019re charging them an arm and a peg. If Disney pays this ransom, they could go into Johnny Debt.\u201d\n\nNot to be outdone, Corden spent time backstage rocking a tight bright red suit, white cowboy boots, and a butterfly tattoo on his chest.\n\n\u201cJust a little something I put together,\u201d Corden quipped as Styles continued to host the show.\n\nThe \u201cSign of the Times\u201d crooner went on to perform his new single, \u201cCarolina,\u201d and read out some \u201cSide Effects\u201d of going solo.\n\n\u201cThose side effects may include \u2013 having to be the cute one, having to also be the sulky one, but it\u2019s hard because you\u2019re also the cute one and there\u2019s nothing really cute about being sulky,\u201d he joked. \u201cHaving to be the dangerous one. That\u2019s hard because you\u2019re already cute and sulky and people aren\u2019t really scared of sad little cutie pies. Having to be the talented one. All this time you spend trying to balance cute, sulky, and dangerous is really eaten up your schedule and it makes it hard to refine your talents.\u201d\n\n\n\nWATCH: Harry Styles Addresses Whether 'Two Ghosts' Is About Taylor Swift: 'It's Pretty Self-Explanatory'\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Styles\u2019 favorite side effect came last when he noted, \u201cGetting to take up the entire album cover with just a picture of you in a bubble bath, which is something you\u2019ve been pitching unsuccessfully to the band for years.\u201d\n\nStyles\u2019 new self-titled album is no. 1 across the globe and features a photo of his shirtless back in a bathtub.
