My boyfriend is a daredevil, he loves to do all [that] stuff.\"\n\n\n\nWATCH: Kaley Cuoco Gushes Over 'Perfect' Boyfriend Karl Cook at 'Why Him?' Premiere\n\n\n\n\"So he told me, 'We're so excited! Midweek we're going to go on a canyon swing!'\" she continued. \"And I'm like, 'Well that sounds like fun, I like a swing. That's fine.'\"\n\nIt turns out, when Cuoco heard \"swing,\" she thought of the traditional, simple park swing. Canyon swinging, it turns out, is something much different.\n\n\"I start Googling it and I'm like, 'Honey this looks like a bungee jump,' and he's like, 'No, no, no it's canyon swing!'\" she recalled. \"I'm looking and I'm seeing these death-defying videos and people posting things like, 'DONT DO IT!'\"\n\n\n\nWATCH: Kaley Cuoco Shares Sweet Snaps From New Zealand Vacation With Boyfriend Karl Cook\n\n\n\nIn the end, Cuoco's concerns were proven correct.\n\n\"It's a bungee jump and if my boyfriend calls it a swing one more time, I swear I'm going to kill him,\" she told Fallon. \"It's a bungee jump.\"\n\nThe actress started to suspect that the adventure was going to be terrifying when they had to hike up a mountain and then get on a zip line, which is when she really began to have reservations.\n\n\n\nWATCH: 'Bachelor' Superfan Kaley Cuoco Watches Finale With Her Boyfriend Karl Cook\n\n\n\n\"But here's the problem. I'm with his family! I felt like I was on The Bachelor! I had to be like, 'Are you ready to take this [step]? Can you jump off with him? This is the next step in your relationship,'\" Cuoco joked. \"I'm like, 'Am I gonna get the rose out of this?'\"\n\nAnd it turns out that the zip line was just the beginning of the white-knuckle thrill ride.\n\n\"So I get off the zip line and they're like, 'OK, you made it. Now we're gonna walk up to the swing,'\" she said, explaining that the next step in the experience requires you to jump into the abyss.\n\n\n\nWATCH: Kaley Cuoco Smooches Boyfriend Karl Cook: \u2018We Love Rainy Days\u2019\n\n\n\n\"They let me and my boyfriend go together,\" she shared, \"They hooked us together and they said, 'OK, jump when you're ready!... It's a six-second free fall and then you swing for 10 minutes. You dangle, and you hope that you're going to see your family again.\"\n\n\"I was screaming the whole way down,\" Cuoco admitted. \"It was horrible, so horrible, it really was. But I got the rose.\"\n\nFor more on Cuoco and Cook's adorable relationship, check out the video below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/et_kaleycuoco_050317_1280.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/et_kaleycuoco_050317_1280.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/216713_kaley_cuoco_dishes_on_her_death_defying_bachelor_esque_date_with_boyfriend_karl_cook", "title": "Kaley Cuoco Dishes on Her Death-Defying 'Bachelor'-Style Date With Boyfriend Karl Cook", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/et_kaleycuoco_050317_1280.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The actress opened up about her terrifying New Zealand adventure with her beau and his family, whom she described as 'daredevils.'", "title": "Kaley Cuoco Dishes on Her Death-Defying 'Bachelor'-Style Date With Boyfriend Karl Cook", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/216713_kaley_cuoco_dishes_on_her_death_defying_bachelor_esque_date_with_boyfriend_karl_cook", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The actress opened up about her terrifying New Zealand adventure with her beau and his family, whom she described as 'daredevils.'", "twitter": {"description": "The actress opened up about her terrifying New Zealand adventure with her beau and his family, whom she described as 'daredevils.'", "title": "Kaley Cuoco Dishes on Her Death-Defying 'Bachelor'-Style Date With Boyfriend Karl Cook", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/216713_kaley_cuoco_dishes_on_her_death_defying_bachelor_esque_date_with_boyfriend_karl_cook", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/et_kaleycuoco_050317_1280.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Kaley Cuoco Dishes on Her Death-Defying 'Bachelor'-Style Date With Boyfriend Karl Cook | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Kaley Cuoco, The Bachelor, Jimmy Fallon", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
