Then the MLS association emails to say, \u2018You\u2019ve been terminated.\u2019 I didn\u2019t even find out from my company,\u201d he said. \u201cSuddenly my real estate license was inactive and my current clients [were] left in the dark. It took hours after my press junket to get anyone with the company on the phone to tell me personally, and even longer to calm my clients, all of whom, by the way, are coming with me to my new firm. It was an ugly day.\u201d\n\nRobert Voets/CBS via Getty; Monty Brinton/CBS via Getty\n\nVarner said he was dismissed in \u201cwhat I felt was an ugly, knee-jerk reaction kind of way.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was devastated,\u201d he added. \u201c[I warned the company that headlines might be coming], but apparently not the people who needed to hear it.\u201d\n\nThe openly gay North Carolina native, who previously worked as news anchor for CBS and Fox affiliates, said he looked forward to working for a firm that would support him during hard times.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t even given the chance to explain or right the wrong,\u201d Varner said. \u201cIn the real estate world, buyers and sellers want to know they\u2019re signing up with a company that won\u2019t dump them or turn their backs on them in time of trial. So I\u2019m talking to several firms now that I know will care about and believe in their employees. I have had several reach out [and] I\u2019m confident I\u2019ll find a better home.\u201d\n\nFROM COINAGE: Outed as Transgender on Reality TV: Survivor\u2019s Zeke Smith\n\nThis season of Survivor, dubbed \u201cGame Changers\u201d for its 34th installment, had been filmed 10 months ago in the Mamanuca Islands of Fiji \u2014 though Varner couldn\u2019t discuss what happened until the episode\u2019s airing.\n\nDuring that time, he said he\u2019s done a lot of growing.\n\n\u201cI have spent 10 months stewing in this awful, horrible mistake I have made,\u201d Varner told EW Morning Live (Entertainment Weekly Radio, SiriusXM, channel 105) on Thursday. \u201cI have been through, I don\u2019t know how much therapy. With the show\u2019s therapist, with a local therapist. I have met with and spoken to several LGBT organizations \u2014 I\u2019ve joined the board of a couple of them\u2026 this has changed me drastically.\u201d\n\nAs tough as it\u2019s been for him, Varner recognizes that Smith, 29, is the real victim in this situation.\n\n\u201cThis is about Zeke,\u201d Varner said. \u201cI can only profusely apologize. I have apologized to him \u2014 we\u2019ve spoken several times on the phone. He continually forgives me. I am amazed and moved at his ability to do that. I know that forgiveness is difficult. I know that he has a lot of people in his ear. I know that watching this last night was traumatic not only for me and my family \u2014 I can only imagine what this was like for him and his friends and everybody who loves him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hurt him,\u201d Varner continued. \u201cWhen we were in pain and we are in fair, we are dangerous people. We say things we don\u2019t mean. And he\u2019s calling me a bigot and full of hate and all kinds of stuff. I forgive him for that. I give him every inch of every room to feel and experience what he\u2019s feeling. If he wants to take swings at me, I\u2019m the one to hand him the bat. I deserve it. I deserve every bit of it. No one is going to beat me up worse than I have myself.\u201d\n\nSmith, who is still in the game, told PEOPLE he was \u201cshell-shocked\u201d by Varner\u2019s decision and struggles with forgiving him.\n\n\u201cI think he hoped others would believe that trans people are dangerous and fraudulent,\u201d he said. \u201cThat reasoning is infinitely worse than him outing me because it\u2019s the same one used to discriminate against, attack and murder trans people. What\u2019s great is that nobody bought it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important people see he lost that fight,\u201d he added. \u201cThe message should be clear that hate will always lose.\u201d\n\nSurvivor airs Wednesdays (at 8 p.m. ET) on CBS.", "images":
