Feeling content knowing I have so many well wishers and prayers from all around the world. \u2665\ufe0f,\u201d she wrote, with the hashtag \u201c#f\u2014cancer.\u201d\n\nAli opened up about her diagnosis on Bravo\u2019s The Daily Dish, saying she was grateful to Lakshmi and Top Chef for supporting her in an interview in December.\n\nTommy Garcia/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images\n\n\u201cAll of the contestants have reached out in many ways; we are a tight group. I\u2019ve had an outpouring of lovely messages and care packages from the production team and the producers,\u201d Ali said. \u201cAnd Padma has been wonderful. We\u2019ve caught up over lunch, and she has come to sit with me during my chemo treatments to keep me company. I\u2019m pretty thankful for my Top Chef fam.\u201d\n\nAli said she found out about her cancer after she began experiencing pain while working at a pop-up restaurant at the US Open last fall.\n\n\u201cI brushed it off as a pulled muscle from cooking,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I woke up one morning toward the end of the event, with excruciating pain in a very swollen shoulder and went straight to the emergency room.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Ali said, she underwent a series of tests and biopsies that resulted in a diagnosis three weeks later.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 28, so hearing that I had a rare and high-grade tumor that is potentially life-threatening was a serious shock to the system,\u201d Ali said of her reaction to her diagnosis. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m handling the news the best that I can: having friends and family around, watching lots of cheesy old TV shows, spending time with my cat, Mr. Meow. I\u2019m just trying to be as a normal as I can when the chemo isn\u2019t kicking my a\u2014.\u201d", "images":
