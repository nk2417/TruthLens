I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2017\n\nThe magazine also took to twitter to respond to the President\u2019s claims. The highly acclaimed publication often reveals \u201cThe Person of the Year\u201d during its final publication, which is released on December 6. They began the feature, which was previously Man of the Year (until 1999), during a struggling time period in 1928.\n\nThe President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year. TIME does not comment on our choice until publication, which is December 6. \u2014 TIME (@TIME) November 25, 2017\n\nThe title is not necessarily a worth of praise, but rather an acknowledgement of how one individual has shaped the entire year.\n\n\u201cThe person or persons who most affected the news and our lives, for good or ill, and embodied what was important about the year, for better or for worse,\u201d stated a former TIME editor.\n\nAdolf Hitler has been a recipient. Allow that to marinate.\n\nTIME, INC. is one of the most renowned, multinational mass corporations in the world. It is based in New York City. The publication often releases several year-end lists that receive much notoriety. The \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d is one of them. Jay-Z, Beyonce, Kanye West and Nicki Minaj have all covered the magazine in the past on their list of 100 Most Influential People.\n\nLook out for The Person of the Year announcement on Dec. 6.", "images": ["https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TSSDownload.jpg", "https://thesource.com/wp-includes/images/rss.png", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bigS.ico", "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/source-logo_red.png"], "top_img": "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bigS.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://thesource.com/2017/11/25/time-claps-back-trump/", "title": "TIME Claps Back at Donald Trump Over \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d Claims", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "follow.it-verification-code-N2RlWmIxTDArNTFCdWJBanpYY0c2Qy9qcXhteDhHUGJ1dEZpQW40bklYbkFHclRmZGtHWExqTytkaW9oS0kyV083VGRwMmFVaFVkSWN4TFhoRkR0RnVjckdWZjFURGJiTG5JSGo1ZHdNRDlkRFJUTUw2T0UvSzhiTnFTQm9uNS98c21LSWgzZFJmOW5NMWFBT0M4VTd6TzdJbGdOaXZKUDZEUmw4ME9tSEVBWT0=": "5pQzDeNkcKQNf35KxPz0", "follow.it-verification-code-VTcwa0tjWlEwcVRmZnlTK0I4cHo5TWdKaFR6SVFoNURoUnJYT2NEZi9Zd3dleUM0WVRUMVN5OGxpWVNpUFhhVHV2Q0REZkxzSEl6TkJBSlpPYXVDaUpkaWNLdjFZUUpyQTg5RlAyeTMrb1ZWS011dlFwVnRpVXY4Z0VkQTlWQ1V8Q0srTlkzVG5vOXQ3ek1YOVhaSmJUd3laZ090ZVhQQ1BDKzlKVXFKOXh3ST0=": "awf3YNPPHcM4FkjmxN7A", "follow.it-verification-code-dFl3ekhzRHBDMmdIQlluWlVTMVJzcFpKMXlQN2hVeHVGRUJ4TWdYei9Bb0FPYkh6eVd4cXVHSVRVSHpjZmZ4azJIcUxmVlgyRFI3dHZiNFA5aW1HQXBXRUNxSGx0cHFMS1NOc0l0OW50TXlRclUzYVZ4MlhBZ1h4U1ZqdHhaZnp8RExYeVdCWVNaemxER3k4QnE4SjZhN3lrMGV1WDFyYXdOT2QxcmZSQS92bz0=": "f3GwnwCFufrBtQDpRT6B", "follow.it-verification-code-Q2drNGtSSmR6TldCdlBIM2tCZzdadnVyRWpUSk44am9BbWJON0lkUytkQjQ0Ky8yY0daa3lHWk9xbmc1L3l2Y3Q5N1hlbTQraXpNZVZBSndySyt2cVFFTGM1UldhajdXT3RtMkwyMmM1d2pqOU1lR1dwVWJGcmxhUE1XanZ1YXh8elFKeEVvRkc5NTNMYU5EdnF1YmpRWEMvcWlRZk8vY1NudXpjWDhwVVFWUT0=": "lKMgtQ7zf6UaujMpkCKd", "follow.it-verification-code-Q1VDRGMycDhDSkJTcEhvRFpyeDNpOExreHpMSU9xZXZkdkVaTWk0c3dib1FuTm9OdEs0RGdxUk1pdlVySWZ4d2ZIbU0wQ05SNHJiUTN4Z1BZNVJYb3ltREh4YTVzKytac1RvZkhiVnlqKzJnSE1oUWxsMU5OZlFnT25lMGNrRG18ZWp5Q1FxcVE5Q1R4K0NuRmZ6cHFKUnQ3cGtQVjF1eDJ0SnJUQTRWd05Wbz0=": "LxUG8fQWPzJ0aYZwFdbg", "follow.it-verification-code-RVI3SXZzNVdhcVA2dHo0ajljOTc0SGNaaWxBTHk4YkVvKzVxOTFVMGw0MnNUM2F1dlR6Y3RMUm1ZV1ZBbWphSVFpTHZtcUhPL3g0cVdJbmdOMjI3VFZkT0R5WlFadmsyUTFWNmlyMTVna3FLU2RucGpkbXQ3aDcyeGZUekJNKzl8WGV3aFZWU2ZZK1V2cDlWTzdadnJzUHZhOUgvWjgwM0NHMWoyVEUzWVBWcz0=": "E5KZXDTbb9MFm9ynlgZ0", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/bigS.ico", "numberOfItems": 5, "itemListOrder": "Ascending"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511586000.0, "source": "http://thesource.com", "summary": ""}
