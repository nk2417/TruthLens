We must swot up on proportions (which aren\u2019t only an age thing, but also a body-type thing). We must apply ourselves to the study of details \u2013 unless, like Michael Kors, who told his mother all the bows on her wedding dress were making him ill, we know everything there is to know about details aged five.\n\nOh God, do we have to know about details? \u201cButtons,\u201d says Samantha Cameron, \u201cand nice zips, and a pop of just the right colour\u2026 That\u2019s the sort of thing that makes something eye-catching and just fashionable enough at every age. My constant search when I was in No 10 \u2013 and one of the catalysts for setting up my label Cefinn \u2013 was for affordable clothes that were classic but with enough fashion to be interesting, so that you could wear them to work, or to pick your kids up from school without embarrassing them, but also to meet your girlfriends.\u201d\n\nRead more: Style File - Samantha Cameron", "images": ["https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615c6ae3400088a4a3c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/original", "https://www.vogue.co.uk/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/uk/logo.svg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615c6ae3400088a4a3a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/original", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615a874380008571626/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/original", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615ea07410008b93986/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/original", "https://www.vogue.co.uk/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/uk/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615ea07410008b93986/2:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/original", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615eabedb00089dfa8b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/original", "https://www.vogue.co.uk/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d5456152c0c410008892d73/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/original"], "top_img": "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615ea07410008b93986/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/original", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Armstrong"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/style-rules-for-dressing-your-age", "title": "On Fighting - And Winning - The Style Eclipse", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Lisa Armstrong", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Fight the style eclipse.
