{"url": "https://stylecaster.com/beauty/spray-tan-tips/", "text": "Warmer weather means less clothing, which means more skin on display\u2014and for some people, that means a fake tan is in order so as to avoid shining like a pale beacon when exposed to the light of day. But it\u2019s 2020, folks, and we all know that baking our skin for real is out and the faux tan is in. Easy at-home self-tanner can be effective but runs the risk of turning your skin (and sheets) orange if you\u2019re not cautious. With that being said, we\u2019ve got plenty of spray tan tips, whether you\u2019re leaving the application to an expert or doing it yourself at home.\n\nTry self-tanner if you haven\u2019t already.\n\nUsing self-tanner at home will help you feel comfortable going for the glow. Focus on either the face or another part of the body first to master the application. Once you decide you like the results, you\u2019re ready to commit to a head-to-toe tan. Results will ultimately vary from person to person, but one self-tanner application will typically last two weeks before it starts to fade (or need a touch-up).\n\nShower and exfoliate first.\n\n\n\nRemove your makeup and take a shower before applying a self-tanner or getting a spray tan. (Keep in mind that certain self-tanner products may require waiting a few hours after cleansing to apply. Remember to always read directions!) While you\u2019re in the shower, use a body scrub to slough away any dry, flaky skin before so that the pigment will adhere smoothly for the evenest results (as in, least streaky). Additionally, avoid using body oil or lotions with oil prior to your tan, as it will cause blotches and prevent the tan from developing.\n\nThink about your undergarments.\n\n\n\nWhile many people decide to get a spray tan or apply self-tanner while wearing nothing (no tan lines!), if you do wear a bathing suit or undergarments, wear pieces you don\u2019t mind potentially ruining with rogue tanning solution.\n\nWear polish to shield your nail beds.\n\n\n\nEven if it\u2019s nothing more than a clear coat, wearing polish will help to protect your nail beds from getting stained by tanning solution if that\u2019s a point of concern. If you already have a full manicure, don\u2019t worry about it getting ruined\u2014you can wipe them off afterward, too.\n\nessie worth the tassle polish $8.84 Buy Now\n\nApply barrier cream.\n\nNaturally drier areas of the skin, like the elbows, ankles, and knees, will absorb more pigment, so always apply a protective barrier cream before the tan so that they don\u2019t go too dark.\n\nPat, don\u2019t rub, your skin dry.\n\n\n\nTo preserve your tan, pat yourself dry rather than scour with a towel after getting out of the shower. The idea is to not exfoliate for as long as possible so that you don\u2019t slough off the tan. Avoid using loofahs or coarse washcloths for the same reason.\n\nBe prepared to correct mistakes (especially if you\u2019re a newbie).\n\nThe pigment that self-tanners or spray tans leave behind is meant to slowly fade as your top layer of skin regenerates, so it\u2019s not the kind of thing you can just scrub off. That\u2019s why it\u2019s able to last up to a week or two\u2014and why you should approach with caution to make sure you won\u2019t be stuck looking unnaturally tan for a full 14 days. If you find you\u2019re seeing patches and want to remove your tan, gently exfoliating your skin with a self-tan removing mitt will do the trick. There are also self-tanner remover products that require less of an effort.\n\nMoisturize every day.\n\n\n\nKeeping your newly tanned skin hydrated is the best way to make the color last longer because it won\u2019t dry out and need to be exfoliated prematurely.\n\nRemember the effects are more gradual than instant.\n\n\n\nSelf-tanner and spray tans will get darker from the time they\u2019re applied and as the days progress. The color takes a little while to fully develop, so don\u2019t be alarmed if you look in the mirror and feel like the results aren\u2019t what you expected\u2014it won\u2019t be for long.\n\nOriginally published July 2016.
