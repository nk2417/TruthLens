Brown won the Emmy for outstanding lead actor in a drama series at the 2017 Emmys on Sunday night.\n\nThe This Is Us star won his second Emmy, much to the excitement of the crowd.\n\nBrown paid tribute to his fellow nominees during his acceptance speech, saying he was a fan of all of them. \u201cBefore anything like this happened for your boy, I was a fan first, last and always a fan. So to my fellow nominees, I\u2019m a fan. I love y\u2019all,\u201d Brown said.\n\nWith the Emmy in his hand, Brown was blown away by those who held it before him. \u201cThis joint right here, like Walter White held this joint here. Dick Whitman held this joint. I may have lost some of y\u2019all but you know, Google it. And 19 years ago Detective Frank Pembleton held this joint, as impeccably played by Andre Braugher,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cI want to thank my cast, Milo [Ventimiglia], Mandy [Moore], Justin [Hartley], Chrissy [Metz]: you are the best white TV family that a brother has ever had. Better than Mr. Drummond, better than the white folks that raised Webster.\u201d\n\nBrown had so much to say that the music began playing during his speech and his microphone was eventually turned down, which was met with boos by the audience.\n\nDon\u2019t miss People and EW\u2019s This Is Us LIVE viewing party! Go to People.com and EW.com during the premiere episode on NBC, Tuesday, Sept. 26 at 9 p.m. ET for our experts\u2019 insight and the can\u2019t-miss social buzz. Plus, we\u2019ll bring you exclusive access to the This Is Us season 2 premiere party \u2013 with all the scoop from your favorite cast.\n\nAfterwards, in the press room, Brown was able to finish his speech:\n\n\u201cI wanted to thank our writers. A show doesn\u2019t get seven acting nominations without some impeccable, beautiful, thoughtful writing. You guys are our life\u2019s blood, so I want to thank you so much. To our producers and directors, in particular, John Requa, Glenn Ficarra, and the crazy cool Ken Olin. I thank you for your guidance and friendship. And I wanted to thank Dan Fogelman \u2014 he is the Hebrew hammer with which our house was built. He makes me laugh and cry in equal parts and keeps me coming back for more, and in his own little small special way. He\u2019s not trying to make America great again, he\u2019s trying to make it the best that it\u2019s ever been and I love him for taking me on this journey. And to my wife, I can\u2019t believe they cut me off before I got to thank my wife, Ryan Michelle Bathe. You\u2019re everything. You make my life worth living. You gave me two of the most beautiful things that God has ever put on this planet: my sons Andrew Jason Sterling Brown and Amar\u00e9 Michael Ryan Christian Brown. Your daddy loves you with the strength of a thousand suns. I\u2019ll see you Monday after work.\u201d\n\nWATCH: \u2018This Is Us\u2019 Stars Open up about Adjusting to the Show\u2019s Mega Success\n\nWatch the full episode of People & Entertainment Weekly Red Carpet Live, streaming now on PeopleTV.

The Americans\u2019 Matthew Rhys, Better Call Saul\u2018s Bob Odenkirk and Ray Donovan\u2018s Liev Schreiber rounded out the category.\n\nWATCH: Bob Odenkirk Looks Back on the Waiter Job Where He
