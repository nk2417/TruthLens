You\u2019re like, a waste of space in my meter right now. You\u2019re annoying as f\u2014 now when we\u2019re together. This is what you do. You\u2019re on your phone the whole time. You\u2019re just not present!\u201d\n\nKourtney tried to defend her \u201c10-minute conversation,\u201d but Khlo\u00e9 wasn\u2019t having it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re only here once,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen are we ever going to go back to Alcatraz? You know what? Actually, I\u2019m not doing this today. I\u2019m not doing this today, because last time in Costa Rica, I looked crazy because I\u2019m always the one complaining to get you guys to have fun. I\u2019m not going to be crazy, okay? You\u2019ll be the f\u2014ing bitch that you need to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. F\u2014 you, you f\u2014ing whore,\u201d Kourtney retorted, adding, \u201cPregnant whore!\u201d\n\nBut at the end of the day, they\u2019re still family, and Khlo\u00e9 made a point to thank Kourtney and Kim, 37, for the memories they made on the trip.\n\n\u201cI wanted to say thank you guys so much for the San Fran trip,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though we had our ups and our downs, I feel like still always have fun. What is life without a little feuding with sisters?\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 learns her baby\u2019s sex\n\nAnother huge moment from the San Francisco trip was Khlo\u00e9 finding out her and Tristan Thompson\u2018s baby\u2019s gender. After her doctor got the genetics results, she texted the information to Kylie Jenner, who had asked to be the one to relay the news to Khlo\u00e9 personally.\n\n\u201cI have such anxiety, I don\u2019t know why,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9 while waiting for Kylie\u2019s phone call.\n\n\u201cWhatever is meant to be \u2014 even if it\u2019s it\u2019s a girl, just know that\u2019s what your path is, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d reassured Kim.\n\n\u201cOf course, and I want a girl eventually,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9. \u201cI just want older brothers to like \u2026 we\u2019ve never had older brothers.\u201d\n\nBut even though Khlo\u00e9 was \u201cconvinced\u201d she was having a boy, she found out she\u2019s actually having a girl \u2014 and her initial reaction was pure disappointment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m having a girl,\u201d she said, looking upset.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d said Kim. \u201cI cried when I found North was going to be a girl, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you have your mind made up as to what you\u2019re having \u2026 and then when you find out it\u2019s the complete opposite, it\u2019s just a shock,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019m like, in a state of shock.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 then called mom Kris Jenner to share the news, confessing she had been hoping Kylie was lying.\n\n\u201cThat is so amazing,\u201d said Kris, 62. \u201cKhlo\u00e9, the only thing I wanted in life was a boy. Three times. And I got the three of you. But a man is much more attached to a girl. This will be the love of [Tristan\u2019s] life \u2014 no offense to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then I\u2019m going to get jealous,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9. \u201cThen I don\u2019t like that \u2014 I don\u2019t like her.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a bitch,\u201d chided Kris.\n\nOf course, Khlo\u00e9 eventually warmed up to the news \u2014 especially once she got to witness Tristan\u2019s adorable reaction.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be like, \u2018How\u2019s my princess doing? I just want to check on my two girls,\u2019 \u201d explained Khlo\u00e9. \u201cHe\u2019s so cute about everything. I still feel so bad [about] how I felt [when I found out], but that\u2019s just how I felt. I am getting more excited.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was looking at nurseries for boys and I just think you need like a day or two to let it sink in, and then you get over it,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd honestly, girls stuff is so much cuter anyway, and it\u2019ll be so cute to have a little girl in the stands rooting for her dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am honestly so excited Khlo\u00e9 is having a girl,\u201d gushed Kim. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting me and Khlo\u00e9 things for our girls, and it\u2019s probably going to be so annoying but they\u2019re all going to have the same things, do the same things, be in the same class.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cute,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9. \u201cSee, that makes me excited! \u2026 My life will never be the same in the best way. I\u2019ve kind of been waiting for this for so long, and now it\u2019s finally happening. I\u2019m so excited to see what the next six months are going to bring.\u201d\n\nKim shares her surrogacy journey\n\nMeanwhile, Kim was going through her own unique journey to motherhood: She and Kanye West were expecting their third child via surrogate. (They welcomed daughter Chicago on Jan. 15.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been such a crazy year,\u201d she reflected. \u201cOur surrogate has been amazing, but it has been challenging with all of the media leaks. \u2026 And it just feels weird that my family has no idea what my experience has been like.\u201d\n\nKim decided to bring her surrogate, La\u2019Reina, over to Kris\u2019 house to introduce her to her mom and sisters. Though the KUWTK cameras avoided capturing La\u2019Reina\u2019s face, they showed a sweet moment where she bonded with pregnant Kylie, 20, and Khlo\u00e9. (The three women were just months apart in their pregnancies.) The scene also marked the first time all season that Kylie\u2019s baby bump was clearly visible.\n\nAfter Khlo\u00e9 asked whether being a surrogate was challenging \u201cemotionally,\u201d La\u2019Reina explained that she doesn\u2019t look at it that way.\n\n\u201cBecause I know from the very beginning this is not my baby,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at the end, my joy and my satisfaction is with whoever I\u2019m having the baby for. \u2026 I know what my job is in all of it. It makes me feel important because I\u2019m like, \u2018Wow, I did something so good. This is beautiful. I would do this again a thousand more times.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cThis is so beautiful,\u201d gushed Kylie. \u201cThis is so amazing. You should be [proud] \u2014 it\u2019s so special.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout you, this wouldn\u2019t have been possible,\u201d added Kris. \u201cSo we can\u2019t say thank you enough.\u201d\n\nBut no one was more grateful than Kim.\n\n\u201cThis experience, going into it, I really didn\u2019t know what to expect because I don\u2019t really know anyone that\u2019s gone through this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was definitely not as easy as I thought it would be, emotionally, but it\u2019s so worth it and our surrogate is such a nice person. My family absolutely loves her and I\u2019m just so grateful.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurrogacy is such a beautiful thing and we\u2019re just so excited to welcome our baby girl,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that we\u2019re all doing this together. My family and my kids mean everything to me.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/uZsmXnOqt01G-64rM6W0OTiwJUc=/343x228/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kim-kardashian-kylie-jenner-kris-jenner-kendall-jenner-111125-f8bba80ac6dd4090813c164b12ede293.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-CwcvfFHuSQXJJG7MkjXDBnjg9g=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kim-kardashian-kylie-jenner-kris-jenner-kendall-jenner-111125-f8bba80ac6dd4090813c164b12ede293.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tzQnM0_mplQpLFqvhLNt_ybQHCo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/khloe-kardashian-aire-kylie-jenner-tatum-111225-a25ac174c38e4b0388f0dc5768ee6822.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/soO1WI_VSmfLueKfYKcuuO3sJuE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kourtney-Kardashian-kris-jenner-111925-97ad62d4d0104012b87082feed3e94f2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ydAr7Lvv0VTsL56Z9lP3om4lnFs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kylie-Jenner-Kim-Kardashian-Kylie-Cosmetics-Celebration-101926-fb527251156e410eb2486fbadab4766a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Uo8iLTyanrj7eNHYmSXZHwHJbxY=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Spencer-Lofranco-112025-56efb2cd379b4817ac0f4d3b10fb37f3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/U-mjd6lmq1aWbjfplhLYd-PUdCc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/north-west-kris-jenner-111925-d915b2784e2a40d9a5c25751eb8e270a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/oT0v8vHWDTeX1cu2dJui-9YGemc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Khloe-and-Kris-Jenner-110125-7ee1cee84bda431babafffb16cdd8606.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/JR82Mu-6q0OzCeFdxLskGpzAxIs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kim-kardashian-halle-berry-111025-7f12d71762bf49758503724049c47962.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/R6D3o4sOuukxwrzvLh8DrNPzSKY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-Kris-Jenner-110925-3-22ec68a7d8e440d5a6a73609cedb58d3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/1Rg5iGKa43KcKndzv0VYtPHiylI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kendall-jenner-kylie-jenner-caitlyn-jenner-split-103025-caf0882972064bb8907afbc3688d51f7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/XwQyixXA_011ylkQPHQEydOxz4Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kardashian-kids-111723-b9dc7981e88e493aad4ae1113e3f4f65.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/HzUuaMgF2qPY-6qcXogzwtEqJyQ=/343x228/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kendall-jenner-khloe-kardashian-110525-b0c33360ee6142419bc7536bafbcbc04.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/djP0TRoy9vuIloEmCmuanA0N1NY=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/quadruple-amputation2-112025-c05ec8d5ca3f44488ab8fd45eb9d724d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/DIBqhWH16iIIKwfwUH9AdWZ75aM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/OJ-Simpson-Kim-Kardashian-Kris-Jenner-Khloe-Kardashian-111925-tout-3ede8207597a4bcc9e59fe9b51fbe723.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/RHokPgm8yu5TtnXKdejLaCCxc-0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kris-Jenner-Birthday-Givenchy-Haute-Couture-by-Alexander-McQueen-1110125-tout-223790a0333a4c868955ad1eed6ffe50.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/_JLK-p3WCFsVRPdlyjmeX9JyhUA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/kylie-jenner3-1-c521ad98296d428393031ea4cf49cecb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/HLFhSY7_JmVk9tAhsKk58nMWB6M=/343x228/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kardashian-kids-111723-b9dc7981e88e493aad4ae1113e3f4f65.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/THhvOr3hMvKGC0mIyG4UCuB9OM4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kendall-jenner-khloe-kardashian-110525-b0c33360ee6142419bc7536bafbcbc04.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/H1fXupjw4eJV-8xvAn1SL7TkFgo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kendall-kylie-jenner-101125-2-c61250cee18f41fdae66a88a8b34b039.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lvxyR5YJvl-cjdU7JfX987oTH0M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/khloe-kardashian-111825-1-226d5148f09e4ee5bd05c7b542f13c2f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/bZmGXn3K6QTMep7gwl0CGwOVoA8=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/david-sharon-schoo-leaving-court-102825-31cfe4a2ae50417c99a42136edcfda93.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/uyZEdSbsOpMManWpO0me2DIDAGg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kendall-Jenner-110525-e4eda425f6e844798989831bbc8d9b9e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/jIK60Q2ZLv7v9GA22X6VPlAmlvU=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jellyroll-instagram2-112025-8ebe824d77cc42eda053a3e687ae8d0f.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/_JLK-p3WCFsVRPdlyjmeX9JyhUA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/kylie-jenner3-1-c521ad98296d428393031ea4cf49cecb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios", "Aurelie Corinthios Is A Former Staff Editor At People.
