This led to a series of back-and-forth statements placing blame for the breakup on one another.\n\nFifth Harmony just released a third, self-titled album \u2014 their first without Cabello \u2014 on Friday in preparation for Sunday\u2019s show. Cabello\u2019s debut solo album, \u201cThe Hurting. The Healing. The Loving.\u201d drops Sept. 22.\n\nFifth Harmony was awarded best pop video for their song, \u201cDown,\u201d featuring Gucci Mane and nominated for song of the summer. Cabello was also nominated for song of the summer for her track, \u201cOMG,\u201d but did not win.\n\nA video of 5H performing \u201cAngel\u201d and \u201cDown\u201d at the VMAs can be viewed below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b22vPo0_wBg", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/5h-vmas.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/5h-vmas.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jd Knapp", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/music/awards/fifth-harmony-vma-camila-cabello-quits-fall-angel-mtv-stunt-video-1202540189/", "title": "Fifth Harmony Take Dig at Camila Cabello in VMAs Stunt", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Fifth Harmony shades Camila Cabello with VMAs stunt.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "JD Knapp", "tags": "Camila Cabello, Fifth Harmony, MTV, MTV Video Music Awards, Video Music Awards", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Fifth Harmony Take Dig at Camila Cabello in VMAs Stunt", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/music/awards/fifth-harmony-vma-camila-cabello-quits-fall-angel-mtv-stunt-video-1202540189/", "description": "Fifth Harmony shades Camila Cabello with VMAs stunt.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/5h-vmas.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Fifth Harmony MTV VMAs"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-28T02:01:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-29T00:25:51+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fifth Harmony shades Camila Cabello with VMAs stunt.", "site": "@variety", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Fifth Harmony Take Dig at Camila Cabello in VMAs Stunt", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/5h-vmas.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503885694.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
