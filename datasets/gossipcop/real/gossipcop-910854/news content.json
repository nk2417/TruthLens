The actor shared a message on Twitter on April 2 that read: \u201cWe all go through the sludge/shit and depression never discriminates. Took me a long time to realize it but the key is to not be afraid to open up. Especially us dudes have a tendency to keep it in. You\u2019re not alone.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s message linked to a story from The Express in which he explained how his own depression battle started after seeing his mother attempt suicide when he was only 15 years old. The actor thanked fans for the messages of encouragement in response to the article.\n\n\u201cShe got out of the car on the Interstate 65 in Nashville and walked into oncoming traffic,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBig rigs and cars were swerving out the way. I grabbed her and pulled her back on the gravel shoulder of the road. She has no recollection of it whatsoever. Probably best she doesn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nJohnson previously shared the story of his mother back in February while he was filming the upcoming season of HBO\u2019s \u201cBallers.\u201d The actor posted on Instagram and said he \u201cgot lucky that day\u201d when he was 15 since his mother walked away unharmed. \u201cThat ain\u2019t always the case,\u201d Johnson wrote.\n\n\u201cStruggle and pain is real. I was devastated and depressed,\u201d he continued to The Express about his own depression. \u201cI reached a point where I didn\u2019t want to do a thing or go anywhere. I was crying constantly.\u201d\n\nJohnson returns to theaters with the video game adaptation \u201cRampage,\u201d which opens nationwide April 13.\n\nSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!
