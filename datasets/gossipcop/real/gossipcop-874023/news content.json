The singer earned the award for Best R&B Album for 11:11 (Deluxe), released in April 2024. It is the extended edition of his eleventh studio album, 11:11.\n\nBrown last took home a Grammy in 2012 when he won in the same category for his record F.A.M.E. The 35-year-old was also nominated for Best R&B Performance for his track \u201cResiduals\u201d and Best African Music Performance for \u201cSensational.\u201d\n\nWho Is Chris Brown?\n\nChris Brown is a Grammy-winning R&B singer known for the pop hits \u201cKiss Kiss,\u201d \u201cForever,\u201d and \u201cWith You.\u201d The Virginia native skyrocketed to fame following the success of his self-titled debut album in 2005, emerging as a teen heartthrob with his boy-next-door charm. Brown became embroiled in controversy, however, after he physically assaulted his then-girlfriend, pop star Rihanna, in 2009. Brown found his songs dropped from the radio for some time but soon rediscovered success on the music charts, earning a Grammy for his 2011 album, F.A.M.E. Over the years, he has continued to receive attention for brushes with the law and has faced several physical and sexual assault allegations. A documentary detailing his alleged history of violence came out in October 2024.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Christopher Maurice Brown\n\nBORN: May 5, 1989\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Tappahannock, Virginia\n\nCHILDREN: Royalty, Aeko, and Lovely\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Taurus\n\nEarly Life\n\nChristopher Maurice Brown was born on May 5, 1989, in Tappahannock, Virginia. His mother, Joyce Hawkins, worked at a daycare center, and his father, Clinton Brown, was a prison guard. His parents divorced when he was 7 but continued co-parenting Chris and his older sister, Lytrell.\n\nInspired by artists like Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, and Usher, Chris was a child when he taught himself to sing and joined his local church choir. He also discovered his love for dance through his father, who showed him how to moonwalk. When Chris was 11 years old, he won his first talent competition at a summer camp. The victory made him want to pursue music as a career. His mother, who had remarried, encouraged his talent, helping him search for a record deal. It was around this time that his stepfather, Donelle Hawkins, began physically abusing Joyce, which terrified young Chris. The abuse continued for years.\n\nThe budding singer recorded his first demo in high school and shopped it around to record labels. Chris had his sights set on Bad Boy Records, owned by Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, but the label refused to sign him. Instead, Chris caught the attention of Tina Davis, who worked for Def Jam Recordings at the time. \u201cThe first thing that hit me was his unique voice,\u201d Davis told Billboard. \u201cI thought, \u2018This kid is a star.\u2019\u201d Davis got him a meeting with a higher-up at the label who offered him a deal on the spot, but the teenager refused because the executive wouldn\u2019t talk to his mother before signing. Davis eventually left Def Jam and became Chris\u2019 manager, promoting him to other labels.\n\n\n\nMusic Career\n\nIn 2004, Brown inked a deal with Jive Records as a 15-year-old. His self-titled debut album was released in November 2005 and quickly found its way into the charts. The singer earned his first No. 1 song with the lead single \u201cRun It!\u201d featuring rapper Juelz Santana. The hit topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks. The album brought Brown two Grammy Award nominations for Best New Artist and Best R&B Contemporary Album. While he didn\u2019t win, he showed off his talents to the audience at the Grammy Awards while performing with R&B legends Lionel Richie and Smokey Robinson.\n\nA new wave of creative output flowed in in 2007. That November, Brown release his second album, Exclusive. The singer was more hands-on for this project compared to his previous work. He helped write several tracks, including the hit single \u201cKiss Kiss\u201d with T-Pain, which earned a Grammy nomination for Best Melodic Rap Collaboration. Brown also worked with Sean Garrett on \u201cWall to Wall\u201d as well as will.i.am and Tank on \u201cPicture Perfect,\u201d among others. He also developed the concepts for his music videos and was co-director of them.\n\nBrown\u2019s third studio album came several months after he was arrested for assaulting his then-girlfriend Rihanna. Released in December 2009, Graffiti didn\u2019t perform as well as his first two records and received mostly negative reviews. He also found his songs dropped from the radio that year. Despite the backlash from his domestic abuse scandal, the album still managed to receive a Grammy nod for Best Contemporary R&B Album.\n\nJeff Kravitz // Getty Images Chris Brown won his first Grammy for his album F.A.M.E. in 2012.\n\nOne of the singer\u2019s most successful albums to date is F.A.M.E. Brown cowrote most of the March 2011 album that featured the hit single \u201cLook at Me Now\u201d and collaborations with Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne, Timbaland, and Ludacris, among other artists. F.A.M.E. debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and sold more than 270,000 copies in its first week. The record later won Best R&B Album at the Grammys, marking Brown\u2019s first trophy from the Recording Academy.\n\nWhile that\u2019s his only Grammy win to date, Brown has received 25 nominations in his 20-plus years as a professional singer. He has been nominated for Best R&B Album three times and has nabbed two nods for Album of the Year for his contributions to Kanye West\u2019s Donda and H.E.R.\u2019s Back of My Mind. Elsewhere, Brown has won five BET Awards and, near the beginning of his career, an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding New Artist.\n\nKnown for his stage presence, the singer has completed several concert tours and performed worldwide. One early success was his Up Close & Personal Tour in 2006 that saw Brown play more than 30 concerts nationwide. Following the U.S. leg of his One Hell of a Nite Tour, Brown began a short stint at Drai\u2019s Nightclub in Las Vegas in October 2015. His contract was put on hold the following year, however, after he accused the club\u2019s employees of racism. In the midst of this, Brown was forced to cancel his tour dates in Australia and New Zealand in December 2015 after the Australian government announced plans to deny the singer a visa over his criminal assault conviction. His tour resumed in Europe in May 2016 and ended a month later. Brown returned to Las Vegas in June 2022 to kick off his multi-year residency. Most recently, he embarked on his 11:11 Tour, which ran from June to August 2024.\n\n\n\nKeep Reading The Greatest Music Stars To Ever Play Las Vegas\n\nHit Songs\n\nBrown has dropped plenty of hit songs since he first came on the scene with the No. 1 single \u201cRun It!\u201d in 2005. The R&B singer has a whopping 118 tracks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, including two No. 1 songs and 17 songs in the top 1o. The Grammy-nominated \u201cKiss Kiss,\u201d his second chart-topper, spent three weeks atop the mainstream songs chart in 2007. The radio hits \u201cWith You,\u201d \u201cForever,\u201d and \u201cLook at Me Now\u201d are among his other top performers on the Hot 100.\n\nIn total, Brown has notched 15 Grammy nominations for his songs, though none have gone on to win. His duet with Jordin Sparks in \u201cNo Air\u201d earned both artists a Grammy nod in 2009 for Best Pop Collaboration, while his song \u201cTake You Down\u201d was nominated for Best Male R&B Performance that year. Later on, \u201cNew Flame\u201d and \u201cNo Guidance\u201d competed for Best R&B Song, with the former also earning Brown a nomination for Best R&B Performance. \u201cSummer Too Hot\u201d and \u201cResiduals\u201d were also recognized with Best R&B Performance nods.\n\nAlbums\n\nSince breaking onto the scene in 2005, Brown has released 11 studio albums and sold the equivalent of more than 20 million copies in the United States along. Among his most popular records are his self-titled debut (2005), the quadruple-platinum Exclusive (2007), the Grammy-winning F.A.M.E. (2011), and the No. 1 album Indigo (2019). His most recent work, 11:11, came out in November 2023. Brown\u2019s albums, in order, are:\n\nChris Brown Brown released his self-titled debut album in November 2005 with Jive Records. The album quickly found its way onto the top of charts, debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. Meanwhile, its lead single, \u201cRun It!\u201d featuring rapper Juelz Santana, topped the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks. The album also included the hits \u201cYo (Excuse Me Miss)\u201d and \u201cGimme That.\u201d Chris Brown earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B Contemporary Album in 2006. Exclusive His sophomore album, Exclusive, came out two years later in November 2007. The album, which reached No. 4 on the Billboard 200, included the hit singles \u201cWith You\u201d and \u201cKiss Kiss\u201d with T-Pain, which earned a Grammy nomination for Best Melodic Rap Collaboration. The track \u201cTake You Down\u201d also received a Grammy nod for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance. In addition to T-Pain, the record features collaborations with Sean Garrett on \u201cWall to Wall,\u201d will.i.am on \u201cPicture Perfect,\u201d and Lil Wayne on \u201cGimme Whatcha Got.\u201d Graffiti Brown\u2019s third studio album was released in December 2009, just months after he was arrested for assaulting his then-girlfriend Rihanna. Despite the domestic abuse scandal, Brown continued to enjoy popularity among the masses. Graffiti made it into the Billboard 200\u2019s top 10, though critics gave it mostly negative reviews. Still, Graffiti was nominated for Best Contemporary R&B Album at the 2011 Grammys. The track \u201cTake My Time\u201d featuring Tank also gained a nod for Best R&B Performance By A Duo With Vocals. F.A.M.E. Brown dropped his fourth record, F.A.M.E., in March 2011 to much success. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200, a career first for the R&B singer, and sold more than 270,000 copies in its first week. F.A.M.E. also gave Brown his first Grammy win, as he took home the trophy for Best R&B Album in 2012. The record included the hit single \u201cLook at Me Now,\u201d featuring Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes, which earned two Grammy nominations for Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance. His single \u201cDeuces\u201d with Tyga and Kevin McCall was also nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Fortune Following his success with F.A.M.E., Brown released Fortune in July 2012. The No. 1 album contained a mix of pop, R&B, and electronic dance music and featured the top 10 hits \u201cTurn Up the Music\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Wake Me Up.\u201d The record was nominated for Best Urban Contemporary Album at the 2013 Grammys. X When his next project, X, came out two years later, it debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200. The September 2014 release launched another hit collaboration in \u201cLoyal,\u201d with Lil Wayne and Tyga. They weren\u2019t the only featured artists on X; Brandy, Kendrick Lamar, Trey Songz, Akon, Usher, and Rick Ross also contributed. The latter two pitched in to the track \u201cNew Flame,\u201d which earned two Grammy nominations in 2014 for Best R&B Song and Best R&B Performance. Brown additionally received a nod for Best Urban Contemporary Album for X. Royalty The singer\u2019s highly anticipated Royalty dropped in December 2015. The No. 3 album was named after his daughter, who was born the previous year. The cover art contains a black and white photo of a shirtless Brown holding the infant. Despite the family-first display, Royalty is more sexually explicit than Brown\u2019s previous work. The album\u2019s best-performing track, \u201cBack to Sleep,\u201d was both praised for its catchy tune and criticized for its controversial lyrics. Heartbreak on a Full Moon On Halloween 2017, Brown unveiled an ambitious 45-song project in Heartbreak on a Full Moon. The double-album clocks in at some 2 hours and 40 minutes from start to finish. The length didn\u2019t deter fans who propelled Heartbreak on a Full Moon to earn gold certification in its first week and to peak at No. 3 on the Billboard 200. Its singles included \u201cPrivacy,\u201d \u201cQuestions,\u201d and \u201cTempo.\u201d Indigo The singer released in his ninth studio album, Indigo, in June 2019. Another double-disc release Indigo became Brown\u2019s third record to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The top 5 single \u201cNo Guidance,\u201d featuring former rival Drake, earned a Grammy nomination for Best R&B song. Years later, \u201cUnder the Influence,\u201d a track included on Indigo\u2019s extended edition, found success on the charts after a boost from TikTok. It reached No. 12 on the Hot 100 in 2023. Breezy Breezy, Brown\u2019s 10th studio album, came out in June 2022. The title was inspired by his long-time nickname. The album debuted at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 and featuring the single \u201cCall Me Everyday\u201d with Wizkid. After a disappointing first week of sales, the singer released the album\u2019s deluxe edition, which received a Grammy nomination for Best R&B Album. 11:11 Brown released his most recent album, 11:11, in November 2023. Despite receiving mostly positive reviews, it didn\u2019t perform as well on the charts as his previous ones. The double-album peaked at No. 9 on the Billboard 200, a respectful performance but one that marks the singer\u2019s lowest ranked solo album. Still, the track \u201cSummer Too Hot\u201d managed to earn a 2024 Grammy nod for Best R&B Performance. The deluxe version of 11:11, released in April 2024, resulted in three more Grammy nominations: Best R&B Album, Best R&B Performance on \u201cResiduals,\u201d and Best African Music Performance on \u201cSensational.\u201d\n\nBeyond his solo work, Brown released a collaborative mixtape with Young Thug titled Slime & B (2020).\n\nMovies\n\nA couple years into his fame, Brown expanded his career as an entertainer by branching out into movie and TV acting. He had a small role in the 2007 box-office hit Stomp in the Yard, which centered around a step dance competition. The movie also featured another popular R&B performer: Ne-Yo. That same year, Brown played against type as a high school band geek on The O.C. for several episodes. He then returned to the big screen with a more substantial role in the 2007 holiday-themed dramedy This Christmas. As Michael \u201cBaby\u201d Whitfield, he played a young man wanting to pursue a musical career despite opposition from his family.\n\nBrown has continued acting over the years, mostly in smaller roles and less successful ventures. This includes parts in the action thriller Takers (2010), the hit romantic comedy Think Like a Man (2012), the breakdancing movie Battle of the Year (2013), and the Nick Cannon\u2013led women\u2019s basketball drama She Ball (2020).\n\nAssault Convictions and Lawsuits\n\nGetty Images Chris Brown pleaded guilty to assaulting his then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009.\n\nIn February 2009, Brown made headlines after being arrested in Los Angeles for assaulting then-girlfriend Rihanna during an argument. Their fight took place in a car and reportedly began when Rihanna found text messages from another woman on Brown\u2019s phone. The \u201cForever\u201d singer then physically attacked her, attempted to push her out of the vehicle, and threatened to kill her. \u201cWords cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired,\u201d 19-year-old Brown said in a statement shortly after the incident. He was charged with two felonies.\n\nBrown pleaded guilty to one count of felony assault that June and, two months later, was sentenced to 180 days of community labor and five years of probation. The former couple were also ordered to stay away from each other. In July 2009, Brown fully acknowledged and apologized for his actions, saying in a video statement that \u201cI have told Rihanna countless times, and I am telling you today, that I\u2019m truly, truly sorry that I wasn\u2019t able to handle the situation both differently and better.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhile still on probation, 24-year-old Brown found himself back in trouble with the law when he was arrested in late October 2013 after punching a Maryland man outside a Washington D.C. hotel. The man had been attempting to get a photo with the singer. Brown was ultimately pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault and was sentenced to time served and a $150 fine for court costs.\n\nHowever, between his arrest and his September 2014 sentencing in the D.C. assault case, Brown struggled to maintain the terms of his probation. He was kicked out of the anger management rehab he had voluntarily attended before a judge ordered to him to 90 days of additional treatment at a live-in treatment facility. His diagnoses of bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder during this stint led to an extension of his court-mandated rehab. He was arrested weeks later, in mid-March 2014, for violating his probation and jailed. That May, a judge gave Brown a year in jail, but he earned his release in early June after receiving credit for his time in rehab then in custody. The singer was delighted to receive his freedom after 108 days in jail, tweeting \u201cthank you GOD\u201d and \u201cHumbled and Blessed.\u201d\n\nMore good news arrived for Brown in March 2015 when a California judge ended his probation from his 2009 felony assault case. \u201cIM OFF PROBATION!!!!!!!! Thank the Lord!!!!!!\u201d he tweeted after the hearing. It wasn\u2019t the end of his legal woes, though. In September 2015, Australian officials warned Brown he might be denied entry to the country because of his conviction on domestic violence charges. The singer ultimately had to cancel his planned tour of Australia and New Zealand, scheduled for that December.\n\nBrown\u2019s troubles with the law continued in early 2017 when he was ordered to stay away from his ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tran. The temporary restraining order was later extended to five years.\n\nRelated Story Actor Danny Masterson Receives 30 Years to Life for Rape\n\nIn May 2018, an anonymous woman filed a lawsuit against Brown and two other people that claimed she was sexually assaulted in the singer\u2019s home. The woman said rapper Young Lo repeatedly raped and Brown had helped the assault occur. The lawsuit was settled out of court and dismissed nearly two years later.\n\nIn January 2019, Brown was detained in Paris after a 24-year-old model accused the singer and two other men of raping her in a hotel room. He denied the account and later sued the woman for defamation. Three years later, in January 2022, Brown was hit with a $20 million lawsuit for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting a woman on Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs\u2019 yacht in Miami years prior. The case was dismissed that August after text messages between the woman and Brown painted a consensual picture of their encounter.\n\n\n\nBrown was sued again in July 2024 for the alleged assault of four concertgoers in Fort Worth, Texas. The $50 million lawsuit claimed that he and his entourage physically attacked four fans backstage during his 11:11 tour. Brown\u2019s attorney called the incident \u201ca setup,\u201d insisting that the singer \u201cnever initiated physical contact.\u201d\n\nIn October 2024, his 2009 assault of Rihanna, as well as numerous other allegations against him, were revisited in the Investigation Discovery documentary \u201cChris Brown: A History of Violence.\u201d\n\nKids\n\nDavid Crotty // Getty Images Chris Brown with one of his three children, Royalty.\n\nBrown is a father to three children: Royalty, Aeko, and Lovely. The singer first became a father with the birth of his daughter, Royalty, in May 2014. His paternity of the child, who he shares with model Nia Guzman, wasn't confirmed until several months later, leading to his break up with actor Karreuche Tran. Brown's fifth album is named after his first born. Years later, he welcomed his son, Aeko, with his ex-girlfriend Ammika Harris in November 2019. He posted pictures of the newborn on Instagram the following month with the caption, \u201cHe just stole my whole face.\u201d Brown's youngest child, Lovely, who he shares with influencer Diamond Brown, was born in January 2022.\n\nNet Worth\n\n\n\nAs of April 2024, Brown has an estimated net worth of $50 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. In addition to music sales, the singer has made his fortune from commercials and a host of business ventures. Brown is founded his own record label, CBE, under Interscope Records, and created the clothing line Black Pyramid. He also owns 14 Burger King franchises.\n\nQuotes\n\nI treat [women] differently because I know I never want to go through the same thing or put a woman through the same thing that the person put my mom through.\n\nI've been humbled by my past experiences and I want my music to speak for itself and to speak for me.\n\nIn the beginning, I used to be hot. I'm normal. I'm human, so if anybody says something that's a lie, I'm numb to it. I've smartened up.\n\nLove is something I am still learning. It's just an obstacle that I haven't yet mastered. I think that's my biggest hurdle in life.\n\nI use music or painting as my outlet to get through the confusion. I try to promote positivity and love.\n\nI feel remorse every day. I'm very ashamed. But it doesn't define me. I try to think about influencing people not to take the road I did.\n\nEverybody that's haters, they just been haters. All my real fans, I love you all.
