We gotta show love while we're here.\"\n\nThen, Drake got a couple of things off his chest. \"Vanessa Hudgens, you look...incredible tonight.\" Now we all know what was going through the rapper's mind when the camera caught him staring at Hudgens during the opening monologue.\n\nNicki Minaj, however, wasn't happy with Drake's comment.\n\nDrake admitted that he and Ludacris haven't always seen eye-to-eye, but he's still a big fan and loves him. Drizzy also expressed his gratitude for finding his way back to Nicki Minaj.\n\nHe even showed his appreciation for Lil Wayne before bringing some levity back by closing his acceptance speech and commenting on his father's purple suit with purple shoes game.\n\nAfterwards, Drake seemed to be shooting his shot, following her on IG and liking one of her pics.
