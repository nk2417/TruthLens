They all want a romantic comedy, a happy ending. We all do,\" Lopez, 49, tells USA TODAY during an interview for her new romantic comedy \"Second Act\" (hitting theaters Dec. 21). \"But it\u2019s not a movie, even if you see us on Instagram or on the shows.\"\n\nThe duo made their red carpet debut on May 1, 2017, at the Met Gala, and have been pretty much inseparable ever since. Lopez called Rodriguez, 43, her \"twin soul\" at the MTV VMAs in August. In October, the two sparked engagement headlines when Lopez was spotted sporting a gigantic diamond ring in Boston at Games 1 and 2 of the World Series.\n\nBut Lopez, who is has been married three times, and Rodriguez (with one past marriage) aren't heading to a wedding chapel anytime soon. She likes where things are right now.\n\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\n\"We\u2019re happy. We\u2019re taking it day-by-day. And it\u2019s great,\" she says.\n\nLast week, Lopez posted a blended-family video on Instagram showing her 10-year-old twins (Max and Emme) with ex Marc Anthony, decorating the Christmas tree with Rodriguez, and his daughters Ella, 10, and Natasha, 14.\n\n\"2018 has really moved us to place where we feel like a real family,\" says Lopez. \"That's nice. And it's good enough right now.\"\n\nShe's loving Rodriguez in a big way.\n\n\"I have nothing but the most amazing things to say about Alex. He\u2019s an incredible friend, partner and father. And he's a family man. He\u2019s just awesome,\" says Lopez. \"We have this great loving support system. You know no matter where you are that you\u2019re rooting for each other.\"", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gciaf/prod/p?a=pageview&p=USAT-TEALIUM-TANGENT&m=web&k=f14ebdd6-0569-4c64-af73-99937bc06379&s=noscript", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/660ea1e0bd7e6049e3ea4dba28cac038717f1f2b/c=67-18-565-516/local/-/media/2019/03/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636880824691829556-bryan-alexander.jpg?width=48&height=48&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/presto/2018/12/11/USAT/e0717854-57c0-439f-86f6-3898aad5d3fd-GTY_912865380.JPG?crop=3273,1870,x0,y142&width=3200&height=1829&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/presto/2018/12/11/USAT/e0717854-57c0-439f-86f6-3898aad5d3fd-GTY_912865380.JPG?crop=3273,1870,x0,y142&width=3200&height=1829&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/12/10/jennifer-lopez-totally-gets-alex-rodriguez-wedding-speculation/2273217002/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez totally gets the Alex Rodriguez marriage talk: 'Everyone wants a fairy tale'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Jennifer Lopez totally gets the Alex Rodriguez marriage talk: 'Everyone wants a fairy tale'", "description": "'Second Act' star Jennifer Lopez totally understands why the world is speculating whether she'll marry boyfriend Alex Rodriguez.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/12/10/jennifer-lopez-totally-gets-alex-rodriguez-wedding-speculation/2273217002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/presto/2018/12/11/USAT/e0717854-57c0-439f-86f6-3898aad5d3fd-GTY_912865380.JPG?crop=3273,1870,x0,y142&width=3200&height=1829&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1829}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Bryan Alexander", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "'Second Act' star Jennifer Lopez totally understands why the world is speculating whether she'll marry boyfriend Alex Rodriguez.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 1279862243338849}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/presto/2018/12/11/USAT/e0717854-57c0-439f-86f6-3898aad5d3fd-GTY_912865380.JPG?crop=3273,1870,x0,y142&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Jennifer Lopez totally gets the Alex Rodriguez marriage talk: 'Everyone wants a fairy tale'", "description": "'Second Act' star Jennifer Lopez totally understands why the world is speculating whether she'll marry boyfriend Alex Rodriguez."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1544418000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
