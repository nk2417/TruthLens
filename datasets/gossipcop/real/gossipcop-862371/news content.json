Hale says she is sorry to anyone who got offended after she body-shamed... herself.\n\nThe 28-year-old \"Pretty Little Liars\" star posted on Twitter and Instagram this week a throwback pic of herself as a bridesmaid alongside her father as a Father's Day tribute and then drew criticism over a comment she made to a fan.\n\n\"Ugh, I was so fat,\" she said.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BVfw5xwlQgW/\n\nMany fans were not having it. Hale was bombarded with comments from fans, some of which expressed concern about her health.\n\n\"@lucyhale fat? Are you kidding me??\" tweeted user @ciaraferguson17.\n\nOthers were annoyed that people were annoyed.\n\n\"Jesus. People can't even say they're fat or feel fat without offending anyone,\" wrote user @missmcizzle.\n\nHale disabled comments on her Instagram photo. She also later took to Twitter to apologize.\n\n\"Sometimes I forget that people are watching everything I do and I say things I don't mean. I'm extremely sorry if my comment about my weight offended anyone,\" she wrote. \"Sometimes we can be our own worst enemy. I know people look up to me and I should be way more aware of what I say sometimes. Thanks for all the love and support. Hope y'all can forgive me!\"", "images": ["https://nbcu.tmsimg.com/assets/p25254909_b_h10_ab.jpg?w=960&h=540", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/08/Roku_Channel_Tile_2000x3000_LosAngeles.png?resize=100%2C56&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/09/GettyImages-2210941206.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C6000px%2C3375px&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/LA_aerial-1-1.png?fit=2060%2C847&quality=85&strip=all&w=400&h=44&crop=1", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/08/Roku_Channel_Tile_2000x3000_LosAngeles.png?fit=3000%2C2000&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/10/KNBC_Rings_On_Light@3x.png?fit=399%2C120&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/11/GettyImages-2245330378-e1763680428457.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/11/AP25308797783758.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/10/KNBC_Rings_On_Dark@3x.png?fit=402%2C120&quality=85&strip=all&w=134&h=40", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/04/LA-web@3x.png?fit=838%2C72&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/11/Video-2-1.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/11/251120-Kevin-Spacey-getty.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/11/image-8-8.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56"], "top_img": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/08/Roku_Channel_Tile_2000x3000_LosAngeles.png?fit=3000%2C2000&quality=85&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Corinne Heller"], "canonical_link": "http://www.eonline.com/news/862371/lucy-hale-apologizes-after-saying-she-used-to-look-fat", "title": "Lucy Hale Apologizes For Calling Herself \u2018Fat' After Body-Shaming Accusations", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.6.4", "parsely-title": "Lucy Hale Apologizes For Calling Herself \u2018Fat' After Body-Shaming Accusations", "parsely-link": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/lucy-hale-apologizes-after-saying-she-used-to-look-fat/2027433/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-06-21T14:45:06Z", "parsely-section": "U.S. & World", "parsely-author": "Corinne Heller", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Los Angeles", "type": "article", "description": "Lucy Hale says she is sorry to anyone who got offended after she body-shamed\u2026 herself.", "title": "Lucy Hale Apologizes For Calling Herself \u2018Fat' After Body-Shaming Accusations", "url": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/lucy-hale-apologizes-after-saying-she-used-to-look-fat/2027433/", "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/08/Roku_Channel_Tile_2000x3000_LosAngeles.png?fit=3000%2C2000&quality=85&strip=all"}, "google-site-verification": "VUQRoXTPcEu2sDqZYyhixp6TJR4J0sph-eMwFDkbaps", "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nbcla", "creator": "@nbcla", "description": "Lucy Hale says she is sorry to anyone who got offended after she body-shamed\u2026 herself.", "title": "Lucy Hale Apologizes For Calling Herself \u2018Fat' After Body-Shaming Accusations", "url": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/lucy-hale-apologizes-after-saying-she-used-to-look-fat/2027433/", "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/08/Roku_Channel_Tile_2000x3000_LosAngeles.png?fit=3000%2C2000&quality=85&strip=all"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "description": "Lucy Hale says she is sorry to anyone who got offended after she body-shamed\u2026 herself.", "sailthru.title": "Lucy Hale Apologizes For Calling Herself \u2018Fat' After Body-Shaming Accusations", "sailthru.description": "Lucy Hale says she is sorry to anyone who got offended after she body-shamed\u2026 herself.", "sailthru.type": "article", "sailthru.date": "2017-06-21T07:45:06+00:00", "parsely-network-canonical": "http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/national-international/lucy-hale-apologizes-after-saying-she-used-to-look-fat/2048805/", "taboola_lead": "video", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/cropped-NBC_LA.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=85&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498031106.0, "source": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com", "summary": ""}
