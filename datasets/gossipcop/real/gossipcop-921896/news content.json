In the photo gallery above, catch up with each of these fierce fillies.\n\nThe very first winner was BeBe Zahara Benet who edged out runner-up Nina Flowers way back on March 23, 2009. Since she sashayed off with the title, BeBe has been one busy bee. She released eight singles and one EP, \"Kisses & Feathers.\" And she just made it to the final four on \"RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars 3.\"\n\nTrixie Mattel won that special edition of the franchise, pulling off an upset over frontrunner Kennedy Davenport on March 15, 2018. That day was a banner one for Trixie as it was also when she dropped her second album, \"One Stone.\" She has been promoting this platter around the country.\n\nFind out which other winners have also raised their voice in song by clicking through the photo gallery above. As you will see, the styles that have won over the judges have varied over the years, with some drop-dead beauties including season 3 champ Raja. Throughout all 12 seasons of the two shows, RuPaul Charles has presided over the proceedings. For his efforts, he has picked up two Emmys as Best Reality Host and will defend that title this fall.\n\nSEE exclusive odds: Who will win 'RuPaul's Drag Race'?\n\nBe sure to make your predictions so that the contestants can see how they're faring in our racetrack odds.
