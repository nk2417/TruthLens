While the choice was dump or donate, many did both and the ALS Association raised a historic $115 million for the devastating disease, per the website. From there, over $96 million has been committed to research projects. You can check the progress on those projects here. And now, four years later, there's a new challenge in town: the ALS Pepper Challenge.\n\nVideos by Wide Open Country\n\nLou Gehrig's disease, also known as ALS, is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that worsens and weakens muscles in those who have the disease. While the research projects are underway from the Ice Bucket Challenge now, the family of a social worker, Patty Haberstroh, wanted to get the ball rolling on another awareness campaign and raise some money for ALS. Patty's family started a website and soon after, posted a video of them eating hot peppers for the #ALSPepperChallenge.\n\nSo far, $469,289 of $1,000,000 has been donated to their goal of raising money for ALS research. They'll continue running the campaign until their goal is met, but it's already bringing national attention to ALS again. In fact, the ALS Hot Pepper Challenge is hot on social media. So hot, actually, that quite a few celebrities have begun to take the challenge.\n\nHere's a list of the celebrities who've participated.\n\n1.
