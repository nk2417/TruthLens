Don\u2019t get us wrong, scouring social media for inspiration and browsing bridal salons for an awe-inspiring gown can definitely be a magical experience, but the novelty of the bridal fashion space for many and the sheer magnitude of options available often provide somewhat of a barrier for brides during their search.\n\nSince you\u2019ve likely never worn a wedding dress before, knowing where to look and what exactly it is that you\u2019re looking for can be difficult to decipher. Should you book appointments at local bridal salons or venture to another city? Will a strapless neckline or a halter neckline complement your body type and wedding aesthetic better? How about a sleek, silky fabric or a textured lace one?\n\nMeet the Expert Terry Hall is the senior director of Galia Lahav. He previously held the titles of head of retail and business development at Amsale and fashion director at Kleinfeld Bridal.\n\nMark Ingram is the founder and CEO of New York City-based bridal salon Mark Ingram Atelier, in addition to his own eponymous wedding dress collection. He has over 40 years of experience in the bridal fashion industry.\n\nMonique Lhuillier is a world-renowned and celebrity-favorite fashion designer who launched her eponymous fashion house in 1996. Her label offers bridal collections, accessories, and ready-to-wear clothing.\n\nAs you start shopping, it may also feel like there\u2019s a whole new language to decode\u2014fit-and-flare silhouettes, crepe fabric, and bateau necklines aren\u2019t terms most people use on a daily basis. To top it off, your wedding dress will likely be the most expensive garment you own, which only heightens the pressure to find the perfect look. And for many brides, the bridal wardrobe doesn\u2019t just start and stop with a wedding dress; some decide to incorporate multiple looks, including a ceremony gown, reception ensemble, and after-party outfit\u2014which can make shopping even more tricky to navigate.\n\nWhether you\u2019ve been envisioning your bridal garment for years or you haven\u2019t thought about your big-day look until you started planning your wedding, we\u2019ve got you covered on how to choose the right big-day getup for you. Below, we offer 65 wedding-dress shopping tips from bridal fashion designers that are guaranteed to help you find the garment of your dreams\u2014no matter your style, budget, or timeline.\n\n\n\nDo Your Research\n\nTo determine your bridal style, compile a visual file of your favorite wedding dresses: Tear pages out of magazines, save Instagram posts, create a Pinterest board, browse online bridal boutiques, and make note of celebrity looks you love. Then, identify an overarching theme\u2014are all of the gowns you pulled embellished, lacy, or voluminous? Do they all have open backs or strapless necklines? Find a couple of commonalities in the styles you like, and bring your ideas to your first appointment.\n\nAdopt an Open Mind\n\nSome brides arrive at a bridal salon with a set idea of their ideal gown, but when they try it on, they realize they don't actually love it. In some cases, they end up falling for a completely different style that they had never considered before. Case in point? Keep an open mind while shopping. By narrowing your focus, you'll miss out on so many beautiful options, one of which might just be your dream look.\n\nBrace Yourself for Bridal Sizing\n\nWhen shopping for a wedding dress, keep in mind that the size of your bridal getup will likely be two to four sizes larger than the size of your everyday clothing. Why, you ask? These garments are made with the assumption that they'll be altered, so they fit the largest part of the body. To figure out your wedding dress size, get measured by a bridal stylist.\n\nPhoto by Aubrey & Brandon Visuals\n\nBegin Shopping Early\n\nRight after you select your wedding venue, it\u2019s advised to start shopping for your wedding dress. To accommodate alterations, customizations, and accessorizing, most bridal stylists recommend buying your gown nine months ahead of your big day.\n\nBut Don't Start Too Early\n\nIf you\u2019re having a long engagement, immediately shopping for gowns won't work for your timeline. If you find an outfit that you love early on, by the time your wedding comes around, the design might not suit your style. Or, worse, you might find another getup closer to the date that you like even better.\n\nEstablish a Budget\n\nWhile it can be uncomfortable to talk dollar signs, discussing this detail will prevent heartache later on. Before your first appointment, figure out who is paying for the gown (your family, your partner, or you) and how much you're going to spend.\n\nIf someone else is paying for your wedding dress, know their hard limit, so if you find an amazing gown that exceeds their designated price point, you'll be prepared to pay the difference.\n\nKnow Your Wedding Aesthetic\n\nBefore you start wedding-dress shopping, one tip to keep in mind is knowing what your wedding design will look like, whether you want a laid-back, garden-themed, or a formal affair. Always keep the venue and theme in mind as you browse gowns, because the last thing you want is for your dress to clash with your overall wedding aesthetic.\n\nPhoto by Janna Brown Photography\n\nKeep Additional Expenses in Mind\n\nAs you look for wedding dresses that adhere to your budget, know that the cost of the frock won't be the only expense you'll need to cover. If you plan to cap your spending at $2,000, for instance, you won't want to purchase a $2,000 gown; that's because tailoring the ensemble, adding accessories, and cleaning the piece after the affair (if desired) will add a significant amount of money to the total bill.\n\nFind a Great Bridal Salon\n\nDo your homework before you start making appointments at bridal salons. Make sure the bridal shop has the dress styles and designers that you've had your eye on, so you don't waste your time. It's also important to read reviews or get referrals from married friends and family, so you don't book a spot that has poor customer service.\n\nRing the Shop in Advance\n\nIf you aren't sure what a bridal boutique or salon offers just by checking its website, consider calling the store ahead of time. By talking to a bridal consultant over the phone, you'll be able to ask specific questions and get the lowdown on the inventory before you make your visit.\n\nMake an Appointment\n\nAnother wedding-dress shopping tip to keep at top of mind? Most bridal stores don't display wedding dresses in a way where you can just leaf through them on your own, like retail stores. Instead, you'll need a consultant to help you select frocks and assist in trying them on, so be sure to book an appointment before you enter the salon.\n\n\n\nPhoto by Rafal Ostrowski\n\nPick Three Adjectives to Describe Your Dream Dress\n\nTo narrow down the multitude of options, begin the process with a clear vision of your big-day look. We suggest choosing three specific words to describe your dream bridal style, whether that be \"classic, vintage, and comfortable\" or \"romantic, glamorous, and embellished.\"\n\nShop on a Weekday\n\nSince bridal salons are usually packed on the weekends, making a Saturday or Sunday appointment usually provides less personal attention from a bridal consultant and more competition among fellow shoppers. To make your experience more worthwhile, try to make your appointment on a weekday, even if that means taking some time off from work.\n\nMake It a Whole-Day Affair\n\nIt's surprisingly time-consuming to put on a wedding gown and take it off, let alone dozens. And you definitely don't want to feel rushed to make a decision. A plausible solution? Turn dress shopping into a whole-day affair. Instead of making brunch plans after your appointment or trying to fit bridal salon appointments in between errands, leave a few hours open in your calendar, so you can take your time browsing and trying on different dresses.\n\nChoose Your Shopping Crew Wisely\n\nYes, you love your mom, sister, sister-in-law, maid of honor, and six bridesmaids\u2014but if you've ever tried to get a crowd to agree on where to go for dinner, you can only imagine how hard it will be to get a consensus on a single gown. Narrow the group down to the two or three people whose opinions matter most to you.\n\nBring the Right Undergarments\n\nYou won't be able to see the full effect of a strapless wedding dress if your bra straps are poking out of the neckline or the potential of a mermaid gown without the right shapewear. For your appointments, be sure to bring the right undergarments. At the very least, have a nude thong, a strapless bra, and Spanx on hand.\n\nPhoto by Chris J. Evans\n\nSelect Your Silhouette\n\nThe shape of your wedding dress will be partly based on your preferred style, your wedding venue, and your big-day aesthetic. Another important factor? The silhouette that flatters your body most and feels most comfortable. A fit-and-flare style, for example, is both contemporary and traditional and works on many body types, whereas a simple sheath is best on tall brides. A voluminous ball gown adds drama but can overwhelm a petite frame, while mermaid cuts show off curves.\n\nConsider Travel Arrangements\n\nIf you're flying to your wedding destination, look into airline regulations beforehand. You don't want to fall in love with a ball gown, only to have it exceed airport size specifications come travel time.\n\nLook at Less Traditional Lengths\n\nWhile they might not work for a black-tie wedding, for a more casual, rustic, or nautical wedding, nontraditional lengths can help infuse personality into your look. Tea-length wedding dresses are fun and playful (while offering a bit of retro flair), whereas mini frocks are modern and stylish.\n\nPay Attention to Fabric\n\nIn addition to the silhouette and length of your gown, pay attention to the fabric. The material of a dress will affect how it looks on you: A heavier, more structured material (think silk shantung, taffeta, or guipure lace) will hold its shape and smooth your figure, while unstructured silk and filmy chiffon can feel more restrictive on curvy brides.\n\nPhoto by Jenn Emerling\n\nWear Heels to the Appointment\n\nSome bridal salons have communal high heels that you can borrow as you try on dresses, but they may be taller or shorter than the pair you intend on wearing as you walk down the aisle (plus, putting on a pair of worn pumps comes with hygienic concerns for some). Instead, bring your own shoes in the same height that you plan to sport for your ceremony and reception (if not the pair), so you'll have a better idea of how the dress will look at the actual event.\n\nCome Prepared With Inspiration Photos\n\nWhether it\u2019s printed photos from your wedding Pinterest board or a page from a magazine, arrive at the salon armed with a collage of the styles you like best. These visual aids will help your bridal consultant better assist you.\n\nInclude Scene-Setting Photos\n\nIn addition to gowns you pull from magazines or social media, bring photos of your ceremony and reception site to the appointment. Seeing the venue's ambiance will help your consultant pick styles that are suitable for the location.\n\nRemember That a Gown Looks Better \"On\"\n\nA wedding-dress shopping tip you'll want to remember as you browse is that hangers can be deceiving: Some wedding dresses have heavy details that make them sag when hung up, so don't knock a certain frock based on the way it appears on display. You won't really know what a garment looks like until you try it on.\n\nVisit Trunk Shows to Save Money\n\nLooking for ways to save money on your wedding dress? Take note of this shopping tip: Visiting a trunk show can lead to a 10-percent discount. Plus, you'll get to meet the designer, who may also \"waive or discount certain changes, like raising or lowering a neckline, extending the length, changing the color, or adding straps,\" says Terry Hall, senior director of Galia Lahav.\n\nHit Sample Sales\n\nAnother budget-friendly wedding-dress shopping tip? Hit sample sales. \"Salons frequently have sales to move older inventory, so you'll find designer gowns for 25 to 50 percent off,\" says Mark Ingram, founder and CEO of Mark Ingram Atelier. \"The only downside is most sales are stocked with sample sizes\u2014that's bridal 8 and 10, comparable to ready-to-wear sizes 6 and 8.\"\n\nPhoto by Keila Bottiglieri with Abby Jiu Photography\n\nKnow That Embellishments Add Big Bucks\n\nFor brides on a budget, minimalist gowns usually come with a more affordable price tag than that of heavily adorned ones. \"Handworks, like embroidery or beading, always add to the cost of the dress,\" Hall notes. Of course, if simplicity isn't your style, those add-ons are worth it\u2014just remember to factor those expenses into your budget.\n\nStick to Your Price Range\n\nAs you browse, try not to exceed your price limit if funds are tight. Even if you love the look of a gown on the rack, if you can't afford it, there's no point in trying it on\u2014you'll just get your hopes up.\n\nPeruse Websites\n\nHeading to a bridal salon isn't the sole shopping route to consider; it's perfectly acceptable (and super convenient\u2014you won't have to leave your couch!) to buy your wedding dress online. If you can't try the gowns on in person, especially if you're ordering a few, make sure you check the return policy to make sure you're entitled to a full refund if it doesn't look as dreamy in person.\n\nCall Ahead for Plus-Size Options\n\nNothing is worse than getting to a bridal salon and realizing that they only stock samples up to size 10, and you have nothing to try on. (Unfortunately, that's the case for many, even though they sell sizes up to 26.) Call ahead to make sure your shop has plus-size samples in your preferred style and by your favorite designers.\n\nPhoto by Franklyn K Photography\n\nTry on Multiple Gowns\n\nUnless you're really lucky, the first wedding dress you try on probably isn\u2019t going to be \"the one.\" If you've tried on dress after dress to no avail, stay patient and keep an open mind until you're absolutely certain you've found the perfect dress. It might even take multiple shopping trips and multiple gowns until you're 100 percent sure.\n\nBut Do Limit Yourself\n\nThat said, it is possible to try on too many wedding dresses. By looking at so many different styles, you might experience decision fatigue and feel even more confused than when you first began your search. To prevent feeling overwhelmed by the options, stick to a few gowns per appointment. If you're still unsure, take a break from shopping and sleep on your favorite choices.\n\n\n\nGet Inspired by Celebrities\n\nEven though you might not have a celebrity's unlimited budget, you can still draw inspiration from their wedding style. Maybe you fell in love with the elegant lace sleeves on Kate Middleton's wedding dress or the halter neckline on Sofia Richie's bridal frock. Use celebrities' big-day getups to fine-tune your bridal style.\n\nStay True to What You Love\n\nIt can be all too easy, especially for people-pleasing brides, to listen to everyone else's opinions on their favorite gown for you. But it's crucial that you listen to your gut and select a style that you love, regardless of other people's expectations and ideas.\n\nPhoto by Elizabeth Cecil\n\nContemplate a Non-White Option\n\nA wedding-dress shopping tip for nontraditional brides is forgoing the standard white hue if it doesn't resonate with your personality or fit your vision. This might mean a more subtle change, like eggshell or ivory, or a bolder color, such as blue or pink.\n\nIncorporate Family Heirlooms\n\nIf you want to incorporate a family heirloom, like your mother's veil or your grandmother's ring, into your wedding look, bring the accessory to each of your shopping appointments. That way, you'll ensure that the adornment works with the gown you're trying on.\n\nTarget Salons in Your Budget\n\nIf there's a salon that's out of budget, don't waste your time making an appointment there. \"You'll feel like you have a wide selection if you choose a salon with lots of options in your budget, rather than feeling like you're limited to just a few gowns if you shop at a salon where most dresses are out of your range,\" Ingram says.\n\nReach Full Confidence Before You Buy It\n\nBefore you charge your card, assess whether you're completely confident in your choice. If there are any lingering doubts, revisit the decision the following day. \"All brides need to know it's their dress before saying 'yes,'\" Hall advises. \"When I work with a bride and sense that she is unsure, I encourage her to sleep on it.\"\n\nPhoto by Sophie Epton\n\nPose for Photos in Various Angles\n\nWhen you try on wedding dresses, chances are, you won't be able to catch a glimpse of the gown from every angle. For an accurate depiction, have a friend or relative take pictures and videos of you in each gown as they hold the camera in various positions and while you strike different poses. Make sure they capture the front, back, and sides of the dress, in addition to adjusting the frame and documenting what it looks like while sitting down and moving around.\n\nRemember That Mirrors Can Be Deceiving\n\nWhile looking at your reflection in the dressing room mirror, a noteworthy wedding-dress shopping tip to remember is that the mirror won't give you the full picture. In fact, you'll likely look different in each mirror, depending on its shape, the angle of your body, and the lighting in the room. Instead of relying on what's reflected back to you, pay closer attention to how the gown looks on you in the photos and videos.\n\nFocus on How You Feel in the Dress\n\nWhile the look of the wedding dress is definitely an important deciding factor, what matters more is how you feel in it. Even if a gown checks all of the boxes, asking yourself whether you feel confident, comfortable, and beautiful will help you decide if it's truly \"the one.\"\n\nConsult Your Peers\n\nIf you're torn between two gowns or you're still on the fence about your dream wedding dress, snap a picture and share it with someone close to you. Nothing can help you make a definite decision quite like unbiased feedback from those you know well and whose opinions you trust.\n\nPhoto by Mashaida Co.\n\nRecall Your Favorite Clothing Styles\n\nCall to mind a shirt or dress in your closet that makes you feel beautiful. Then, ask yourself what classifies this garment as your favorite. Is it the fit, the fabric, the neckline, or the silhouette? Whatever it may be, recall the most flattering components of your current wardrobe and use those characteristics to guide your dress shopping experience.\n\nWalk Away if You Feel Any Pressure\n\nIf you aren't fully certain about a dress, a salesperson, a friend, or a relative should never pressure you to make a decision when you aren't ready. Since a wedding gown is a very sentimental and valuable purchase, take all of the time you need to decide\u2014without any guilt.\n\nOrder Early to Avoid Rush Fees\n\nEliminate sky-high fees by ordering your garment early. \"Since gowns take so long to be produced, placing your order eight to 12 months in advance means you will avoid rush fees, which can run as much as 30 percent of the price of the dress,\" Hall says.\n\nAsk a Professional to Take Your Measurements\n\nEven if you're buying your wedding dress online, have a seamstress take your measurements before you put your card down. Having precise numbers, down to the inch, will guarantee a better result.\n\nPhoto by Cedar & Pines Photography\n\nTest Your Movement\n\nThere's nothing worse than spending the entirety of your wedding day tugging at a tight dress or pulling up a loose neckline. To make sure your dress fits perfectly, test the garment while in motion. If you're planning a church wedding that includes kneeling, practice that position in your gown. To evaluate whether the design is suitable for dancing, bend down and twirl around while wearing the piece.\n\nAvoid Sizing Down\n\nMost gowns can be altered down one or two sizes and, depending on the seam allowance, up one size, so it's better to order a larger size and take it in than to be stuck with a zipper that won't close. That said, shopping true to size is always the best option.\n\n\n\nFigure Out Your Beauty Look\n\nIf you go wedding-dress shopping with a messy updo and zero makeup, you won't see the full effect of each dress that you try on. Treat your appointment like a trial run, arriving in the hairstyle and makeup look that you intend to wear on your special day. You don't have to go all out, but adding some glam will help you better envision your big-day ensemble.\n\n\n\nDiscount Tears as a Sign\n\nWhile some brides shed tears when they try on \"the one,\" sobbing isn't always evidence that you've found your dream dress. If you aren't an emotional person or if you view a wedding dress as an extension of your personal style, you might not cry in the dressing room\u2014and a lack of tears doesn't mean it isn't the right getup for you.\n\nPhoto by Justine Milton\n\nPersonalize Your Outfit With a Trusted Tailor\n\nLooking to save some cash? Consider this wedding-dress shopping tip: If you're buying a wedding dress off the rack, invest in a good tailor who will give you a perfectly altered gown that isn't as costly as a couture iteration.\n\nBook Early if You Prefer a Destination Bridal Shop\n\nIf you've seen a bridal shop on a TV show (say, Kleinfeld Bridal or Bridals by Lori) that you're eager to visit in person but that isn't close to your residence, why not plan a trip there? Just make sure that you book your appointment far in advance, especially if it's on the weekend.\n\nThe major benefit of these stores is that they have some of the most knowledgeable consultants and a wide variety of dresses from hundreds of designers.\n\nBrowse Local Bridal Boutiques\n\nAlthough local bridal boutiques offer fewer dress options, they provide an intimate setting that's perfect for a personalized shopping experience. Bridal consultants at local shops are also familiar with the area, so they often have insight about the top styles other brides are wearing. If you're throwing a local wedding, they might also know your venue, which will help them find selections that coincide with the setting.\n\nScan a Bridal Superstore\n\nBig chains, like David's Bridal, have a wide price range, meaning you can snag a dress for less. Plus, you can usually try on wedding dresses in your size, not a sample size, which is good news for brides who fall above or below a size 8 or 10, the usual sample sizes.\n\nPhoto by Ashley Noelle Edwards\n\nNote a Secondhand Route\n\nNot only do pre-owned vintage gowns substantially slash costs, but they're also the perfect pick for retro wedding aesthetics. Another bonus? With a secondhand choice, you'll get to wear a totally unique wedding dress that likely no one else owns.\n\nCommunicate With Your Bridal Consultant\n\nIf you're shopping with a consultant at a bridal boutique or salon, don't be afraid to communicate exactly what you're looking for. Be as honest and open as possible. The more information you give them, particularly regarding your likes and dislikes, the easier it will be for the consultant to pick out your dream gown.\n\nBear in Mind the Season\n\nIf your wedding is in the Caribbean in August, go for lightweight fabrics in breezy styles. But if you're getting hitched in the winter in Boston, it's all about snow-like sparkle and heavier, lush materials, such satin or taffeta.\n\nThrow Out the \"Rules\"\n\nWhile wearing a white dress on your wedding day is the conventional choice, you don't have to follow the \"rules.\" It's your day, after all, so it's important that you select a style that feels unique to you. If you want to wear a taffeta ball gown on the beach or a trendy pantsuit to your garden affair, by all means.\n\nPhoto by Steph Sorenson\n\nPrioritize the Bodice\n\nYou should love every aspect of your wedding dress, but remember that the top of the gown will appear most prominently in the photos, especially while you're seated at dinner or dancing with your nearest and dearest. Make sure that the gown fits comfortably when you're sitting down and that the neckline won't require any adjusting throughout the day.\n\nTweak the Gown in Tailoring, But Don't Redesign It\n\nWhen getting your dress tailored, you can certainly add little details or make minor tweaks, as long as you don't deviate from the original design. \"It's fine for a good seamstress to do small updates, like adding straps or changing the hemline, but any customization that requires the inner support and structure of the gown to be changed is risky, costly, and, many times, irreversible,\" says bridal designer Monique Lhuillier. \"If it's not done with precision, it can potentially ruin a gown.\"\n\nDon't Panic If the Final Product Isn't Like You'd Imagined\n\nIf the dress arrives and you're iffy about it, you don't need to scrap it. Gather your trusted style advisers and try it on with different accessories, like a belt or birdcage veil. If that doesn't work, a seamstress can revamp the piece by altering the neckline, hemline, or sleeves.\n\nSave Some Cash If You Must Start Over\n\nIf following the aforementioned tips still doesn't work, but you can't afford to buy a second wedding dress from scratch, sell it online. In your description, emphasize that the garment is brand-new and unworn. That way, you can get back nearly 80 percent of the retail price, which you can put toward a style that you truly love.\n\nPhoto by Glorianna Chan\n\nThink About Adding a Bustle\n\nIf the dress of your dreams has a long train or hem, consider getting a bustle sewn into the gown; this will help you pick up your train during the reception, so you don't trip on it. Keep in mind, though, that a bustle will alter how the back of the dress looks. Before you make any decisions, research the different bustle styles out there to see if any of them are right for your dress.\n\nArrange a Dress Preview Policy\n\nYou probably won't want your partner to see your pick, but what about your friends? Make a rule that specifies to whom you'll send a photo of your dress, whether it's just those at your bridal appointment, solely your wedding party, or close family and friends. If you don't set the rule in advance, you could feel trapped into showing everyone who asks, which might cause the gown to lose some of its allure during your big-day reveal.\n\nStore It Away From Home\n\nIf you live with your significant other, you won't want them to stumble upon your gown and ruin the surprise. Ask a relative or very trusted friend to store your dress at their place until your nuptials. Plus, if the piece isn't in your closet, you won't be tempted to put it on until your special day, which will preserve its magic.\n\n", "images":
