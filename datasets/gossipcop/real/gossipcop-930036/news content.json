She\u2019s a tennis master, entrepreneur, fashion designer, and philanthropist. Her most recent and proudest accolade agreed upon by all, including Serena herself, was the birth of her daughter, Olympia. On the red carpet, Serena told Vogue: \u201cThe one thing I\u2019m most proud of is becoming a mom. That is everything, hands down.\u201d On what she has not yet accomplished but would love to, Serena said, \u201cBecoming a multi-mom. I have some records I want to break, but having more kids is my goal.\u201d Olympia is already proving to be a stylish baby thanks to Serena\u2019s good taste. When dressing her, often in mommy-and-me matching style, Williams said, \u201cI just think about things that are comfortable and easy to change a diaper. I get most of her clothes on Amazon. They have great, fun clothes. I want her to be very humble, and I want to start that at an early age.\u201d Ohanian added, \u201cI am so proud and in awe of my wife!\u201d\n\nVenus agreed with Serena on her sister\u2019s greatest accomplishment: \u201cShe\u2019s a tennis champion and an unbelievable mom. She does everything for the baby. Balancing her career is not easy, especially when you\u2019re a world tennis champion. I\u2019m most proud of her for that.\u201d Designer Vera Wang shared similar sentiment, telling Vogue: \u201cUnderneath that incredible champion is a very human woman. When she gets off the court, she has a desire for a very different kind of life. People will understand the struggle of what it is to be a champion at that level. It\u2019s a wonderful dichotomy\u2014people see the glamour, they see the wins, they see the trophies. But they don\u2019t know what that struggle is day in and day out. There are two sides: There\u2019s the woman side and there\u2019s the champion side, and they\u2019re really one in the same.\u201d\n\nFollowing the red carpet, guests gathered into the movie theater to watch the first two episodes of the Being Serena series. Baby Olympia sat on Serena\u2019s lap in the theater, while a few rows away the Hadid sisters sat next to Wang and Wintour. After the screening, guests dined at Porter House in Columbus Circle, where the Williams clan enjoyed steak and MoonPies, a personal favorite of Serena\u2019s.", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68ff473fe717aa4811cf527e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5ae1e810ebc7245f7f2f6900/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-being-serena.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6906bd8c2c0bbff3401f91b9/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68febc0766983856acc3fd00/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68f9e6112d10c5a4b0f2e923/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68f88bb5d0b36c02122a8965/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5ae1e84ef3f6a97285347445/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/02-being-serena.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68f9ea9416b20c7658fbb76d/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/69076ddf0c627e95181b9796/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5ae1e84edd36a16842883924/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/01-being-serena.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/69020bda87438d1eb564474f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68ff86fa5df1976f01b578a2/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/us/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/69025cc818c539880a138f2f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5ae1e84ef8acad647e0a2b60/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/00-story-being-serena.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68ff8e65d9ac017b1b65592d/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68f7927c177117ab738f5c0a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5ae1e810ebc7245f7f2f6900/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-being-serena.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zachary Schwartz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/being-serena-premiere-serena-venus-williams", "title": "Serena Williams Is Celebrated On and Off the Court at the Premiere of Being Serena", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Zachary Schwartz", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "The HBO documentary series Being Serena follows Serena Williams through her pregnancy, wedding to Alexis Ohanian, and return to tennis.", "id": "5ae1e7cb11ab624ed677276e", "keywords": "serena williams", "news_keywords": "serena williams", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=289380413, app-argument=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id289380413?pt=45076&ct=VOG_Smart_Banner&mt=8", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5ae1e7cb11ab624ed677276e", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The HBO documentary series Being Serena follows Serena Williams through her pregnancy, wedding to Alexis Ohanian, and return to tennis.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5ae1e7fb69b96d47fd7dcfc7/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-being-serena.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5ae1e7fb69b96d47fd7dcfc7/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-being-serena.jpg\"}", "og": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5ae1e810ebc7245f7f2f6900/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-being-serena.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Serena Williams Is Celebrated On and Off the Court at the Premiere of Being Serena", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/being-serena-premiere-serena-venus-williams"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-04-26T15:48:24.690Z", "modified_time": "2018-04-26T15:48:24.690Z", "author": "Zachary Schwartz"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5ae1e810ebc7245f7f2f6900/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-being-serena.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Serena Williams Is Celebrated On and Off the Court at the Premiere of Being Serena"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5ae1e810ebc7245f7f2f6900/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/00-social-being-serena.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524757704.69, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
