Shep also dropped a shocker when he revealed that at one point, Craig Conover was actually trying to date Kathryn, plus he shared that Ashley Jacob\u2019s behavior was actually worse than what was shown on the show.\n\nIf you recall, Kathryn, 24, and Shep, 38, had a one night stand during season one of Southern Charm before Kathryn started dating Thomas Ravenel. Many fans of the show had thought it was a one and done deal until Kathryn revealed on this season that they had hooked up a few more times over the years.\n\nFirst, Andy asked Shep who initiated their hookups again.\n\n\u201cWell, we met at one of my bars. And we had a couple of drinks and it was just like on fire again,\u201d said Shep.\n\nThe question then turned to the number of times Shep and Kathryn have hooked up over the years.\n\n\u201cTotal? Probably like six or seven,\u201d he revealed. \u201cOriginally, I was [her booty call]. We were each other\u2019s booty calls. Then she fell back with Whitney [Sudler-Smith] and Thomas, and I was like \u2018no, no, no.'\u201d\n\nAndy also wanted to know if the two go out on dates first before hooking up. \u201cNo, no,\u201d laughed Shep, adding: \u201cBut I would go on a date with her!\u201d\n\nShep was then asked if anyone on the cast was aware of his secret hookups with Kathryn before it was revealed on the show this year.\n\n\u201cWell, yeah because I kind of stole her from Craig. Craig was courting her but he slept in her bed two nights in a row and didn\u2019t try anything. And I was like \u2018what are you doing?\u2019 so I was like I\u2019ll try some things,\u201d he stated , giving female fans of the show once more reason to love Craig !\n\nFinally, Shep was questioned about Thomas\u2019s girlfriend Ashley, who has received a TON of backlash this season due to the way she has treated Kathryn, which includes calling her an \u201cegg donor.\u201d According to Shep, what viewers saw on the show is actually tame in comparison to what actually went down during the cast\u2019s drama-filled vacation.\n\n\u201cShe was so emboldened and walking around like she owned the place, when what she should have been doing is \u2018hey, I\u2019m really sorry about last night\u2019 because we were having a good time on Daufuskie Island,\u201d said Shep. \u201cWe were eating well and drinking well, and she said some things that were so inappropriate.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cthe audience doesn\u2019t even know the half of what she actually said.\u201d\n\nShep also wondered why Thomas has yet to break up with Ashley, stating Thomas \u201cwould have all the support in the world if he said no thank you\u201d to his relationship.\n\nPhotos Credit: John Nacion Imaging/startraksphoto.com, Charles Sykes/Bravo, Faye Sadou/MediaPunch/INSTARimages.com.\n\nTELL US \u2013 THOUGHTS ON SHEP\u2019S COMMENTS?", "images": ["https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/feed-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20440%2068'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Shep-Rose-Kathryn-Dennis-Craig-Conover-and-Ashley-Jacobs.jpg", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/retina-pin2k-logo-1.png"], "top_img": "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Shep-Rose-Kathryn-Dennis-Craig-Conover-and-Ashley-Jacobs.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sola Delano"], "canonical_link": "https://realityblurb.com/2018/07/10/southern-charms-shep-rose-reveals-how-many-times-hes-hooked-up-with-kathryn-dennis-says-craig-conover-tried-to-date-kathryn-ashleys-behavior-was-much-worse/", "title": "Southern Charm\u2019s Shep Rose Reveals How Many Times He\u2019s Hooked Up With Kathryn Dennis!
