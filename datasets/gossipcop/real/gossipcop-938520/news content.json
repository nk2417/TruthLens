Very annoyed,\u201d the 46-year-old says. \u201cI get \u2018Dad, put a shirt on\u2019 all the time. Even when I have a shirt on! If I have one shirt, they say put another shirt on.\u201d\n\nThough his daughters may find their father embarrassing at times, his anti-dad bod does occasionally come in handy.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t like it when I scare the boyfriend and then all of the sudden they\u2019re like, \u2018Dad, can you come see me at school?\u2019 because they want me to come and scare the boyfriend,\u201d Wahlberg quips.\n\nWith four children, Wahlberg is thrilled with any affection they throw his way. He even brags about getting a recent hug from his eldest child, 14-year-old Ella.\n\n\u201cShe was just off guard for a second,\u201d he jokes to DeGeneres. \u201cShe slipped up for a second and didn\u2019t realize it until we were mid-hug.\u201d\n\nIn honor of his kids \u2014 Ella, Michael, 12, Brendan, 9, and Grace, 8 \u2014 Wahlberg wanted to come up with a way to get students excited to learn. He found that in a revival of Captain Kangaroo, the popular children\u2019s TV show that aired from 1955-1984.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to find new ways to get my kids interested in science, technology, engineering, things like that. Mathematics, which is the worst,\u201d Wahlberg shares. \u201cSo \u2026 what made me interested in school was Captain Kangaroo, which ran for, like, 30 years. They did 50 seasons. We are bringing back a cool STEM scientist as Captain Kangaroo.\u201d\n\nLast summer, Wahlberg exclusively told ET how he felt about a boy showing interest in Ella.\n\n\"Nobody is a good type or sort. For me, you know, I'm super overprotective,\" he explained. \"But he's just a very nice, young, smart boy who is very polite and well prepared.\"\n\nAs for the rest of his kids, the dislike over the shirtless pics isn\u2019t too surprising.\n\n\"They pull no punches,\" he admitted last June. \"They're very honest.\"\n\nWahlberg may be in shape, but even he doesn't eat healthy all the time! Here's a look at his typical cheat day:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-12/1280_michelle_williams_getty895165310.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-04/gettyimages-624060342.jpg?h=523ddb09&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/rozman_20180522_15162_0367r.jpg?h=c6980913&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-01/gettyimages-895175300.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/rozman_20180522_15162_0367r.jpg?h=c6980913", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2019-12/celebkids_eod.png?h=dc0df84a&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/rozman_20180522_15162_0367r.jpg?h=c6980913", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/mark-wahlberg-says-daughters-get-annoyed-with-his-shirtless-pics-102885", "title": "Mark Wahlberg Says Daughters 'Get Annoyed' With His Shirtless Pics", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/rozman_20180522_15162_0367r.jpg?h=c6980913", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "\u201cI get \u2018Dad, put a shirt on\u2019 all the time.\"", "title": "Mark Wahlberg Says Daughters 'Get Annoyed' With His Shirtless Pics", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/mark-wahlberg-says-daughters-get-annoyed-with-his-shirtless-pics-102885", "type": "Article"}, "description": "\u201cI get \u2018Dad, put a shirt on\u2019 all the time.\"", "twitter": {"description": "\u201cI get \u2018Dad, put a shirt on\u2019 all the time.\"", "title": "Mark Wahlberg Says Daughters 'Get Annoyed' With His Shirtless Pics", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/mark-wahlberg-says-daughters-get-annoyed-with-his-shirtless-pics-102885", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/rozman_20180522_15162_0367r.jpg?h=c6980913", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Mark Wahlberg Says Daughters 'Get Annoyed' With His Shirtless Pics | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, Mark Wahlberg", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
