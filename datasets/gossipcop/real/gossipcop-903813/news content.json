Israel, Esq.).\n\nThe award capped off a season of other honors for Oldman at shows such as the Critics\u2019 Choice, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild and BAFTA Awards. It was the first Oscar win for the actor. He was previously nominated for best actor for 2011\u2019s Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.\n\nIn Darkest Hour, Oldman portrays revered U.K. Prime Minister Winston Churchill in the early days of World War II. The actor praised Churchill as he accepted his award, saying, \u201cI would just like to salute Sir Winston Churchill, who has been marvelous company on what can be described as an incredible journey.\u201d\n\nOldman concluded by thanking his mother, \u201cwho is older than the Oscar, she is 99 years young, next birthday. And she\u2019s watching the ceremony from the comfort of her sofa. I say to my mother, \u2018Thank you for your love and support. Put the kettle on. I\u2019m bringing an Oscar home.'\u201d\n\nBackstage, Oldman said that his Darkest Hour role held \u201cspecial significance\u201d for him. \u201cI can\u2019t say what it would be like to win an Oscar in any other year, but to win it for playing Winston makes it doubly special. It\u2019s been an unforgettable experience.\u201d\n\nWhen asked what Churchill would say to today\u2019s political leaders, Oldman replied: \u201cHe would probably give them a good talking to.\u201d\n\nThe Oscars were handed out Sunday at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywoood.
