The singer recently told The Cut that her body image influences the way she dresses, which we first read about on StyleCaster.\n\n\"I actually have had the pleasure of a fluctuating body type, where one day I can literally fit into something that is body-con, and then the next day \u2014 the next week \u2014 I need something oversized,\" she told The Cut. \"I need a little crop here and a high-waist there to hide that part, you know?\"\n\nA post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) Oct 11, 2017 at 5:37pm PDT\n\n\"I really pay attention every day when I go into the closet about what's working for my body that morning.

You having a skinny week? You having a fat week? Are we doing arms this week? We doing legs this week? We doing oversized?\" she said.\n\nA post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) Oct 13, 2017 at 1:59pm PDT\n\nRegardless of how she feels, Rihanna said that she sees fashion as something fun.\n\n\"I love to play with silhouettes as well, but I think it's important to make sure that you wear the thing that works for your body the best, and that's flattering,\" Rihanna explained.\n\nA post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) Oct 8, 2017 at 8:05pm PDT\n\nNo matter what she's wearing or how she's feeling, we're obsessed with Rihanna's trendsetting, runway-inspired sense of style.", "images": ["https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "https://i.insider.com/59ca7e47ba785e6cf76b2d63?width=700", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/59e61e3506fca07c7347cbe6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/59e61e3506fca07c7347cbe6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Susie Heller"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/rihanna-outfits-body-type-style-2017-10", "title": "Rihanna explains how she dresses for her 'fluctuating body type' \u2014 and it's surprisingly relatable", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Rihanna explains how she dresses for her 'fluctuating body type' \u2014 and it's surprisingly relatable", "datePublished": "2017-10-17T15:13:00.000Z", "dateModified": "2017-10-17T15:13:32.000Z", "news_keywords": "News, Style, Fashion, Rihanna, Celebrity", "description": "The singer recently walked The Cut through her process for choosing what to wear in the mornings, and proved that even she has good and bad body image days.", "author": "Susie Heller", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "tbi-vertical": "News", "og": {"title": "Rihanna explains how she dresses for her 'fluctuating body type' \u2014 and it's surprisingly relatable", "description": "The singer recently walked The Cut through her process for choosing what to wear in the mornings, and proved that even she has good and bad body image days.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/rihanna-outfits-body-type-style-2017-10", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/59e61e3506fca07c7347cbe6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@businessinsider"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"psvp": "c"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "59e61e3606fca07c7347cbe7", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"sections": "News", "tags": "Page Type:story"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2025-05", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
