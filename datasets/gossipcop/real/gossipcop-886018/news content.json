{"url": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/13/16465216/ben-affleck-harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment", "text": "is a senior correspondent on the Culture team for Vox, where since 2016 she has covered books, publishing, gender, celebrity analysis, and theater.\n\nThe scandal that has destroyed the reputation of Hollywood mega mogul Harvey Weinstein appears to be widening its scope to the point that it might take down actor and filmmaker Ben Affleck, too.\n\nAffleck, like other prominent figures in Hollywood, has publicly denounced Weinstein, declaring himself \u201cangry and saddened\u201d at the allegations that Weinstein has harassed and assaulted multiple women throughout his career, and saying that reading details of the accusations \u201cmade him sick.\u201d\n\nBut in speaking out against him, Affleck \u2014 a close colleague and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Weinstein\u2019s \u2014 seems to have only inspired people to share accounts of the harassment he has allegedly committed himself. Multiple women have come forward with accounts of harassment from Affleck, both on- and off-camera, as well as stories they say prove he has been complicit in other men\u2019s harassment of women.\n\nAs Anna North wrote here at Vox, when one woman comes forward with a story of sexual assault, she inspires a domino effect: More women feel that it is safe to come forward with their own stories, so what started out as a case built around Ashley Judd and a few other women saying on the record that Weinstein harassed them became a case with dozens of accusers.\n\nAnd the domino effect can work between cases, too. Multiple sources have said that women began to speak out against Weinstein because they saw what happened to Roger Ailes and Bill O\u2019Reilly and Bill Cosby when women joined together to share their stories. Now, the domino effect seems to have spread from Weinstein to Affleck.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether it will do more than cause a temporary scandal, and whether it will ever lead to actual consequences with measurable, lasting effects.\n\nAffleck\u2019s past includes a lot of time spent around men facing sexual harassment accusations, and a lot of time on camera groping women\n\nOne reason that Affleck has become something of a secondary target as fallout from the Weinstein scandal spreads is that he spent much of the last year helping his brother Casey Affleck successfully campaign for an Oscar, even as the story emerged that Casey had faced two sexual harassment lawsuits in the past. Ben appeared at parties and premieres with Casey in what looked like an attempt to whip up support for Casey\u2019s Best Actor run, and he certainly never made a public statement condemning Casey\u2019s alleged sexual harassment \u2014 a fact that many observers were quick to point out when he made a statement condemning Weinstein.\n\nSo Affleck has a history of appearing to support men who have been accused of committing sexual assault, a history that is fresh in the public\u2019s mind. And it seems to have prompted multiple people to remember that Affleck also has a history of publicly groping women under the cover of frat-boy humor. Most infamously, he is said to have groped the breasts of One Tree Hill actress Hilarie Burton when they appeared on MTV\u2019s TRL together in 2003.\n\nIn the segment, Affleck (who was 31 at the time) wraps his arm around Burton (then 21) and slides his hand down and out of the frame, apparently tweaking her breast, while Burton laughs uncomfortably. \u201cThat\u2019s a move,\u201d he tells the camera nonchalantly.\n\nThe episode cuts to a talking head confessional. \u201cSome girls like a good tweakage here and there,\u201d Burton says. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a high five.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a kid,\u201d she wrote on Twitter this week, adding, \u201cI had to laugh back then so I wouldn\u2019t cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI acted inappropriately toward Ms. Burton and I sincerely apologize,\u201d Affleck responded on Twitter.\n\nIn another video that resurfaced this week, Affleck pulls interviewer Anne-Marie Losique onto his lap and comments on her breasts while filming a 2004 segment for the Canadian TV series Box-Office. \u201cEverything you know about Affleck is wrong,\u201d says the summary for the video on YouTube, apparently uploaded by an independent party in 2006.\n\n\u201cThey would like it better if you did the show topless, the station, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d he says, appearing to hold Losique down on his lap as she squirms. \u201cYou usually show a lot more cleavage than this,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhat\u2019s the story? Why are you covering it up today?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Sunday morning,\u201d Losique says, laughing.\n\n\u201cThat never stopped you before from getting them titties out,\u201d Affleck says, smirking. He pulls her in tighter and hugs her. \u201cThese breasts are very firm, suspiciously firm, I have to say.\u201d\n\nIn an interview this week, Losique told the Hollywood Reporter she was not uncomfortable with Affleck\u2019s behavior. \u201cThis was for the camera,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have to understand that we have done dozens and dozens of interviews like that. It was for a show I was producing, so I was not at all a victim. When the cameras rolled, we would start to do that game. As soon as it stopped rolling, there was none of that. He never touched me in any improper way. He was very respectful, I must say.\u201d\n\nBut while Losique may not have minded Affleck\u2019s advances, other women have come forward to say that Affleck groped them in public as well \u2014 and that he did not have their consent and they most certainly did mind.\n\nTV writer Jen Statsky and author Annamarie Tendler both say that Affleck groped multiple women at a Golden Globes party in 2014. \u201cHe walked by me, cupped my butt and pressed his finger into my crack,\u201d wrote Tendler on Twitter, adding, \u201cI guess he tried to play it like he was politely moving me out of the way and oops touched my butt instead of my lower back?\u201d Affleck has not publicly commented on Tendler\u2019s allegations.\n\nThe emerging narrative about Affleck has been met not with surprise but with resigned acceptance and disgust: Yes, that tracks, seems to be the overwhelming sentiment. Affleck has publicly associated with men accused of sexual harassment for so long that it feels shocking less because these allegations are emerging, and more because they didn\u2019t emerge years ago. If it\u2019s common for Affleck\u2019s younger brother and close professional colleague to allegedly harass the women around them without any apparent disapproval from Affleck, the thinking goes, it doesn\u2019t seem implausible that Affleck himself would also harass the women around him.\n\nIn 2017, a sexual harassment scandal can hurt a career. But it won\u2019t necessarily end one.\n\nIt seems likely that Harvey Weinstein is going to be cut out of Hollywood for a long, long time. Maybe he\u2019ll even be cut out for longer than the eight years Mel Gibson spent in exile after he was caught on tape telling his wife she deserved to be gang-raped before he returned to the fold this year with an Oscar nomination for directing Hacksaw Ridge. And as Ben Affleck gets caught in the domino effect, he too might have to take a break from public life and his film career.\n\nAs more and more women come forward to speak out against powerful men in Hollywood with allegations of sexual harassment, assault, and rape, it\u2019s become less dangerous to make these allegations. There\u2019s less fear of being blackballed for the rest of your career, or having every detail of your past dug up and legislated on CNN.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear that these allegations actually end the careers of the men who face them. And it has yet to be proved that any of them will ever face legal consequences.", "images": ["https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9453113/98094146.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C9.9316166257079%2C100%2C80.136766748584&w=1200", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-2155209999.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.669458870833%2C0%2C66.661082258335%2C100&w=2400", "https://www.google-analytics.com/g/collect?v=2&tid=G-C3QZPB4GVE&cid=555&en=noscript_page_view", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/the-true-meaning-of-friendsgiving.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=21.875%2C0%2C56.25%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/3_Vox_FuturePerfect25_LandingPage.gif?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9605083/687736578.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=13.3%2C0%2C51.333333333333%2C77&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9538503/headshots_1508964052528.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AlexAbad-Santos_Vox.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-2155209999.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0.0041883062489489%2C0%2C99.991623387502%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AlexAbad-Santos_Vox.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-590696434.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/3_Vox_FuturePerfect25_LandingPage.gif?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-590696434.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9605083/687736578.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0.46666666666667%2C0%2C77%2C77&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-2217689678.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.650390625%2C0%2C66.69921875%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/author_profile_images/11909/profile_pic.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=96", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9538503/headshots_1508964052528.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/the-true-meaning-of-friendsgiving.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10711815/490064598.jpg.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C1.8536350505537%2C100%2C96.292729898893&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9453113/98094146.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0.99999999999999%2C0%2C98%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-2217689678.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.024402147388969%2C100%2C99.951195705222&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10711815/490064598.jpg.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=15.383333333333%2C0%2C69.233333333333%2C100&w=2400"], "top_img": "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9453113/98094146.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C9.9316166257079%2C100%2C80.136766748584&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Constance Grady"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/13/16465216/ben-affleck-harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment", "title": "The Harvey Weinstein scandal has inspired a Ben Affleck scandal", "meta_data": {"bingbot": "nocache", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@voxdotcom", "url": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/13/16465216/ben-affleck-harvey-weinstein-sexual-harassment", "title": "The Harvey Weinstein scandal has inspired a Ben Affleck scandal", "description": "Multiple women are accusing Ben Affleck of sexual harassment.", "image": {"identifier": "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9453113/98094146.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C9.9316166257079%2C100%2C80.136766748584&w=1200", "alt": "24th Annual American Cinematheque Honors Matt Damon -
