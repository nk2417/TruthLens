Before she joined Vox in 2014, she was the first TV editor of the A.V. Club.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 has revealed both the birthday and the names of her 1-month-old twins via a post on Instagram. The twins, named Sir Carter and Rumi, are \u201cone month old\u201d according to the singer\u2019s post. Assuming they were born in California, that would put their birth date at June 13, 2017.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 posted a photo of herself with the twins shortly after 10 pm Pacific time.\n\nThe post deliberately echoed February\u2019s pregnancy announcement.\n\nThe initial pregnancy announcement referenced Renaissance paintings of the Madonna when pregnant. Similarly, the introduction of Sir Carter and Rumi calls back to paintings of the Madonna with her son, the Christ child. (Here\u2019s a pretty good example of one that seems as if it may have provided a model for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s post.)\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and her husband, Shawn Carter (better known as rapper Jay-Z), welcomed their first child, daughter Blue Ivy Carter, in 2012. Beyonc\u00e9 most recent album, Lemonade, was released in 2016 and went on to become one of the year\u2019s top-selling albums. Jay-Z\u2019s latest release, 4:44, came out just weeks ago.\n\nThe names of Sir Carter and Rumi have been rumored for weeks now, after documents to trademark both names were filed with the government in late June.", "images": ["https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/author_profile_images/195899/emilyheadshotredhair.0.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=96",
