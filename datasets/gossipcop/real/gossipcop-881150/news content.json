If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission. Learn more about our review process.\n\nIt's that time of year again when the who's who of Hollywood come together for the biggest night in film \u2013 the Oscars. This year, the 97th Academy Awards will air on Sunday, March 2nd, at 7 p.m. EST. And while we are all for tuning in to see who takes home the top awards, including the coveted Best Picture Award (we're rooting for The Substance, Go Demi!), what is an award show without fashion?\n\nMost stars play it safe \u2014 opting for elegant gowns showcasing Hollywood glamour. But then there are those who aren't afraid to take a risk and turn heads. Do you remember Cher's iconic black sequin ensemble with the matching headdress from 1986 or Bj\u00f6rk's 2001 duck dress? Billy Porter shocked the world in 2019 when he stepped out in Christian Siriano's half-tuxedo, half-dress number. If you're like us and appreciate a good dose of nostalgia, then you'll love this list of the most talked-about Oscars dresses of all time.\n\n", "images":
