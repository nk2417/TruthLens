Dean Winters\u2019 character, Brian Cassidy, is coming back again.\n\nSVU showrunner Michael Chernuchin revealed in a new interview with The Hollywood Reporter that Cassidy is coming back for a new arc. Chernuchin didn\u2019t give any more details on Winters\u2019 return.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\nChernuchin, who is in the middle of his first season as SVU showrunner, brought Winters back earlier this season for a pair of episodes. He was seen in the season 19 premiere, \u201cGone Fishin,\u2019 \u201d and the second episode, \u201cMood.\u201d\n\nWinters was one of SVU\u2018s original stars, and was paired with Munch (Richard Belzer) in the first season. After leaving 13 episodes in, he returned to the show in Season 13 and made more regular appearances in seasons 14 and 15.\n\nIn \u201cGone Fishin,\u2019 \u201d Cassidy was the one to tell Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) that she was under investigation for child abuse. Cassidy is now working in the district attorney\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be romantic,\u201d Chernuchin said of Cassidy\u2019s return in a THR interview in September. \u201cThey\u2019re going to go mano a mano, so to speak, in episode two. She\u2019s going to bring the hammer down on him.\u201d\n\nWhen Winters isn\u2019t in SVU, he\u2019s best known for appearing as \u201cMayhem\u201d in the All State commercials. He\u2019s been doing that since 2010, and stars in a series of new commercials for the insurer. The actor also recently starred in John Wick and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.\n\nNew episodes of SVU air on NBC at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nPhoto credit: Michele Short / NBC", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/70afec6a-3143-4947-b047-428e525611d4.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel S.
