Tiptoeing has never been Serena Williams\u2019 style. As she took center court Tuesday at the French Open, her first Grand Slam tournament in 16 months, Williams skipped wearing a traditional tennis skirt and came out rocking a black, full-length Lycra bodysuit and the braids she wore at her friend Meghan Markle\u2019s royal wedding to Prince Harry two weekends ago. On TV, Tennis Channel commentator Mary Carillo captured what\u2019s changed for Williams in three words:\n\n\u201cHere comes Mom.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams is 36 and seemingly unfettered by age, having won 10 of her 23 Grand Slam titles since her 30th birthday \u2014 the last of them at the 2017 Australian Open, where she didn\u2019t lose a set during her seven-match tear though she was secretly eight weeks pregnant. But it\u2019s telling that Williams, unlike her older sister, Venus, routinely allows retirement talk to leak into her remarks now, or that her sit-down interviews increasingly appear less on the sports pages and more often in places like Vogue and Vanity Fair and CNN.\n\nSerena is increasingly looking beyond the baseline and toward the rest of her life.\n\nThe latest comeback that Williams has embarked on Tuesday will almost certainly be remembered as Serena\u2019s Last Act, the final installment in her transformative, often tumultuous, ultimately transcendent career.\n\nWilliams should not win this particular French Open. But that doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t pull off the greatest high-wire act of her career.\n\nShe\u2019s the queen of The Big Ask, as longtime tennis writer Pete Bodo so perfectly called her a few weeks ago. Though she\u2019s played sparingly and missed long stretches of matches before, then resumed pulverizing the rest of the tour as if she never left, it\u2019s never been under circumstances like this.\n\nEven for Williams, playing only four singles matches since giving birth to her first child, getting married, filming a bracingly intimate five-part HBO documentary about the past year, and then working feverishly to return to tennis has been an epic undertaking filled with fits and starts. She nearly died from a pulmonary embolism in 2011 and was smart enough to know she was in danger again after she gave birth to her daughter, Olympia, last September by emergency C-section because the baby\u2019s blood pressure was dropping too low. The next day, as Serena later recounted to Vogue, she became short of breath, dragged herself out of her hospital bed and into the hallway to summon a nurse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI need a CT scan with contrast and a heparin (blood thinner) drip,\u201d Williams correctly told the medics, who did an ultrasound at first instead. \u201cA Doppler?\u201d she challenged them. Soon she was in surgery to deal with an abdominal hematoma, then surgery again to implant a filter to protect her from more blood clots in her lungs. Once she got home, she was in bed for six weeks. She briefly tried to come back in February but realized after a 2-2 singles record that she wasn\u2019t fit enough or ready.\n\nSo before she defeated 70th-ranked Kristyna Pliskova, 7-6 (4), 6-4, on Tuesday with a solid but understandably uneven performance, Williams had not played a competitive match in two months \u2013 unless you count the overhead smash she blasted at Madrid Open tournament director Ion Tiriac after she withdrew from his tournament a few weeks ago and he made some boorish remarks about her pregnancy weight gain. \u201cI\u2019ll have words with him,\u201d Williams told The New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s an ignorant comment and a sexist comment and maybe he\u2019s an ignorant man.\u201d\n\nNor did she remain quiet when French Open officials declined to seed her among the tournament\u2019s Top 32 players because she\u2019s been inactive so long, justifying it by pointing out they did the same to former No. 1s Viktoria Azarenka and Kim Clijsters after they became mothers.\n\n\u201cPregnancy is not an injury,\u201d Williams shot back, adding momentum to a worldwide discussion about how women often pay for jumping on the Mom track.\n\nWilliams\u2019 willingness to engage such issues unapologetically and head-on is classic Serena. It\u2019s already a little melancholy to think how less interesting tennis will be once she\u2019s gone. She\u2019s been the most dominant and outspoken and revolutionary female sports figure since Martina Navratilova. When Billie Jean King \u2014 the holder of those honorifics before them\u2013 asked Williams to sit on the board of The Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative last year, King said she was looking for someone like-minded to pass the torch to \u2014 and Serena is it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Serena has amplified and expanded on what King and Navratilova did.\n\nShe\u2019s become an increasingly eloquent voice on race in the years since she won her first major at 17. She\u2019s fiercely smart and witty, unabashedly strong and sensual, hyper-competitive enough to threaten to cram a ball down the throat of a US Open lineswoman once upon a time, and yet vulnerable enough to admit some of the personal attacks and losses over the years have hurt like hell.\n\nShe\u2019s a style maven/social media maestro who does acting and music video cameos with the likes of Beyonce, and a business mogul and has earned $84 million on the court and an estimated $150 million off it. In addition to the new Duchess of Sussex, she numbers Sheryl Sandberg, Oprah Winfrey and 10.5 million Twitter followers among her friends, not just Nike founder Phil Knight.\n\nWilliams refuses to be boxed in by old tropes or conventional thoughts about what\u2019s \u201cappropriate\u201d or \u201cfeminine\u201d or \u201cimpossible,\u201d flicking away attacks on her musclebound build and answering probing questions, like what it\u2019s like to be an African-American icon who married a white businessman, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, with grace.\n\n\u201cIt just goes to show you that love truly has no color,\u201d she has said.\n\nWhen Ohanian was asked to describe what attracted him to Serena, he told Vanity Fair, \u201cI felt like a door had been opened to a person who made me want to be my best self. . . . I find myself just wanting to be better by simply being around her because of the standard she holds.\u201d\n\nNow that Williams has these additions to her personal life, there\u2019s been some outside chatter that she doesn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d tennis anymore.\n\nBut she says, \u201cI want more.\u201d\n\nShe concedes she can feel the sweep of her 20-year career behind her and dreams of leaving with a \u201cdrop the mic\u201d moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe\u2019s volunteered that \u201cthere\u2019s something really attractive\u201d about just going off to the house she and Ohanian recently bought near his San Francisco base and being a mom to their nine-month-old daughter. She said Tuesday that she thought about Olympia before taking the court Tuesday against Pliskova. When told during her on-court interview immediately afterward that her outfit was trending on Twitter, Williams smiled and said it was a nod to, \u201cAll the moms out here that had a tough pregnancy and have to come back and try to be fierce in the middle of everything.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t beat a catsuit, right?\u201d she joked.\n\nWilliams \u2013 who plays Australia\u2019s Ashleigh Barty next, and perhaps two-time French Open champ Maria Sharapova after that \u2014 has been asked over and over the past few months what she\u2019s enjoyed most about Olympia so far, and she always sounds absolutely smitten: \u201cMy favorite thing is her toothless smile\u2026.Just holding her, and the way my heart skips a beat. I never thought of that\u2026We\u2019ve never been apart more than 24 hours. Ever\u2026We\u2019re not spending a day apart till she\u2019s 18.\u201d\n\nBut there is at least one more huge thing in tennis that Williams says she has to do, and it has less to do with proving anything about competing after motherhood \u2013 though she\u2019s interested in that too. It\u2019s more about cementing her claim to the title of greatest tennis player ever, regardless of gender, even if that\u2019s another honorific her main rival for the distinction, 20-time Slam winner Roger Federer, ceded to her in an interview with the Wall Street Journal a week ago.\n\nWilliams wants to slingshot past Margaret Court for most Grand Slam singles titles ever, at 25. She needs two more.\n\nMaybe that will be the drop-the-mic moment Serena is looking for. Or maybe she\u2019ll look back someday and say it wasn\u2019t one moment, but a constellation of them. Either way, it\u2019s riveting to see her back. The breadth of what Williams has accomplished and the person she\u2019s become isn\u2019t limited to tennis. She\u2019s the queen of The Big Ask, all right. And already, she\u2019s emphatically answered every question no matter how this last act goes.\n\n(Top photo: Jean Catuffe/Getty Images)", "images":
