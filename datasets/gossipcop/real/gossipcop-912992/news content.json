News reports that DeJesus also posted more photos of herself after the procedure on Instagram Stories. \u201cEw [laugh out loud] can\u2019t wait for all the blood to wash off and dead skin to fall,\u201d she wrote on one of the pictures.\n\n\u201cI did a tummy tuck, a breast lift with an implant exchange because she did have implants from before \u2014 she wanted to be smaller, higher and perkier \u2014 so we changed her implants out for smaller ones,\u201d Salzhauer told E! News. \u201cAnd we also did some contouring and reshaping of her booty, of her shape overall. We did that, I think it was a week ago Monday.\u201d\n\nSalzhauer said DeJesus \u201cdid great,\u201d especially since she went to him before.\n\n\u201cI am happy that she\u2019s sharing her journey with the world because there are a lot of moms that want mommy makeovers and they\u2019re scared,\u201d Salzhauer told E! News. \u201cSeeing somebody that they know, even if it\u2019s through social media, go through it is helpful as far as educating people about it.\u201d\n\nAs InTouch Weekly reported last week, DeJesus also shared graphic before and after photos on Snapchat. Javi Marroquin, who broke up with DeJesus last month, was by DeJesus\u2019 side to support her. However, her decision to get plastic surgery was one of the reasons for the split.\n\n\u201cJavi and I are not together anymore. Our future just doesn\u2019t line up. He doesn\u2019t want me to get my surgery for a breast lift, lipo, and tummy tuck (which I\u2019m doing in two weeks) because it\u2019ll look bad on his name at work. Also, I don\u2019t plan on moving in with him in the summer and for these reasons, he broke up with me,\u201d she told Blasting News last month.\n\nShe continued, \u201cI have no bad things to say to about him. He wanted a wife and home right now and I didn\u2019t see a reason to rush. I wish him the best going forward, and I am sad things panned out this way, but this is where things currently stand. Again, we are no longer together.\u201d\n\nDeJesus welcomed her second child, Stella DeJesus, last summer. Stella\u2019s father is an ex-boyfriend, Luis.
