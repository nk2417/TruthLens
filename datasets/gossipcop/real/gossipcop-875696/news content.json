Big Machine Records released the song on August 24, 2017, following an approximately year-long hiatus due to the controversies that affected Swift's public image in 2016.\n\nWritten and produced by Swift and Jack Antonoff, \"Look What You Made Me Do\" has an electronic production combining electropop, dance-pop, progressive pop, and synth-punk with elements of hip-hop, electroclash, industrial, and electro. It contains an interpolation of \"I'm Too Sexy\" (1991) by the English pop group Right Said Fred, whose members received songwriting credits as a result. The melody incorporates strings, plinking piano, and synthesizers, and the chorus consists of drumbeats and rhythmic chants. The lyrics are about the narrator's contempt for somebody who had wronged them; many media publications interpreted the track to be a reference to the controversies that Swift faced, including the Kanye West feud.\n\nThe accompanying music video premiered at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards and contains various implications of Swift's celebrity that received widespread media speculation. Both the song and the video broke streaming records on Spotify and YouTube upon release. \"Look What You Made Me Do\" polarized music critics: some deemed it a fierce return and an interesting direction but others criticized the sound and theme as harsh and vindictive that strayed away from Swift's singer-songwriter artistry. Critics have considered \"Look What You Made Me Do\" a career-defining comeback single for Swift.\n\nIn the United States, the single peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100 with the highest sales week of 2017 and was certified four-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The single also peaked atop the singles charts of countries including Australia, Canada, Ireland, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom, and it received multi-platinum certifications in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Swift performed the song on the Reputation Stadium Tour (2018) and the Eras Tour (2023\u20132024).\n\nBackground and release [ edit ]\n\nTaylor Swift released her fifth studio album, 1989, on October 27, 2014; it sold 10 million copies worldwide less than three years after its release,[2] and three of the album's singles reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100.[3] The album propelled Swift to pop stardom; Billboard wrote that it brought forth \"a kind of cultural omnipresence that's rare for a 2010s album\".[3] Swift's popularity turned her into a media fixation,[4] and her once-wholesome \"America's Sweetheart\" reputation was tarnished by short-lived romantic relationships and public celebrity controversies, including a publicized feud with the rapper Kanye West and his then-wife, the media personality Kim Kardashian, over West's song \"Famous\" (2016) in which he claims he made Swift a success (\"I made that bitch famous\").[5][6][7]\n\nAlthough Swift said she never consented to the said lyric, Kardashian released a phone recording between Swift and West, in which the former seemingly consented to another portion of the song.[8] After the West\u2013Kardashian controversy, Swift became a subject of an online \"#IsOverParty\" hashtag, where online audiences used the \"snake\" emoji to describe her.[7][9] Detractors regarded Swift as fake and calculating, a conclusion that surmounted after years of what they saw as a deliberate maneuver to carefully cultivate her public image.[10][11] Swift became increasingly reticent on social media despite a large following and avoided the press amidst the commotion and ultimately withdrew from public appearances.[12][13] She went through a hiatus mid-2016 and felt \"people might need a break from [her]\".\n\nOn August 18, 2017, Swift blanked out all of her social media accounts,[15] which prompted media speculation on new music. In the following days, she uploaded silent, black-and-white short videos of CGI snakes onto social media, which attracted widespread press attention.[17][18] Imagery of snakes was inspired by the West\u2013Kardashian controversy and featured prominently in Swift's social media posts.[19] On August 23, she announced on Instagram a new album, titled Reputation.[20] The following day, she unveiled the lead single from the album, \"Look What You Made Me Do\",[21][22] which was released for streaming and download on digital platforms by Big Machine Records.[23] A lyric video was released simultaneously; it was produced by Swift and Joseph Kahn and directed by ODD.[24] The lyric video features prominent snake imagery, depicting the chorus with an ouroboros,[25] and its graphics were influenced by the aesthetics of Saul Bass for the 1958 film Vertigo.[26] It was viewed over 19 million times within the first 24 hours on YouTube, setting a record for the most-viewed lyric video in that time frame.[27]\n\n\"Look What You Made Me Do\" impacted US contemporary hit radio on August 29, 2017.[28] In Germany, the track was released as a CD single by Universal Music on October 27, 2017.[29] Media publications regarded \"Look What You Made Me Do\" as Swift's comeback after her year of hiatus from the public spotlight.[30][31][32][33]\n\nComposition and production [ edit ]\n\nSwift wrote and produced \"Look What You Made Me Do\" with Jack Antonoff, who also programmed the track and played its instruments, recorded at Rough Customer Studio in Brooklyn.[34] Other musicians on the track included Evan Smith (saxophone), Victoria Parker (violin), and Phillip A. Peterson (cello). Laura Sisk engineered the song, and Serban Ghenea mixed it at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The track was mastered by Randy Merrill at Sterling Sound in New York.[35]\n\n\"Look What You Made Me Do\" is 3 minutes and 31 seconds long.[23] It is written in the key of A minor and has a tempo of 128 beats per minute.[36] The track begins with string swell and plinking piano keys and progresses into an electronic production; The New York Times wrote that the opening strings and piano were melodramatic and evoked a \"dark, fantasy-film\" atmosphere,[17] whereas The Daily Telegraph's Sarah Carson described the strings as \"Hollywood\"-inspired.[37]\n\nThe verses and chorus are built on a minor-key motif,[38] electronic tones, and hip-hop-inspired beats and vocal cadences.[17][39] The pre-chorus incorporates piano and synth-simulated brass,[17] and the bridge incorporates strings that swell over a reverberating crescendo.[37] The chorus consists of drumbeats and rhythmic chants of the title, which is repeated eight times with different tones of delivery.[17][38] The melody contains an interpolation of \"I'm Too Sexy\" (1991) by the English pop group Right Said Fred, leading to its members Richard Fairbrass, Fred Fairbrass, and Rob Manzoli receiving writing credits.[40][41] The Fairbrass brothers were contacted one week before the release of \"Look What You Made Me Do\" and were asked whether a \"big, contemporary female artist who hasn't released anything for a while\" would be able to use a portion of their song for her latest single; they found out that the artist in question was Swift after the song was released.[42]\n\nJon Pareles commented that the piano and strings in the pre-chorus and bridge gave them a \"melodramatic, emotional\" feel, whereas Swift's repeating the title in the chorus sounded \"vindictive, mocking, dismissive, even a little playful\".[17] Music critics mostly described the track as electropop.[26][43][44][45] NPR's Lars Gotrich said that the beats and vocals evoked electroclash,[45] Rolling Stone's Brittany Spanos said it was a dance-pop song,[46] and Fact's Chal Ravens deemed it progressive pop.[47] Annie Zaleski characterized the genre as synth-punk. The production incorporates elements of mid-1980s and 1990s industrial and electro.[17][34] Some critics commented that the track showcased a \"darker\" soundscape compared to Swift's previous releases;[17][34] Spanos attributed this effect partly to the \"dark techno\" of Britney Spears's 2007 album Blackout,[49] while Maura Johnston in The Guardian said that the atmosphere evoked Spears's \"Piece of Me\" (2007) and the beat was reminiscent of Peaches's \"Operate\" (2003).[26]\n\nLyrics and interpretations [ edit ]\n\nWith the key themes being betrayal and vengeance,[17][38] \"Look What You Made Me Do\" was developed by Swift as a poem about her feelings and realizations that she could not trust certain people and could only rely on a few.[50] The verses contain lyrics such as, \"I don't like your perfect crime/ How you laugh when you lie\"; according to Pareles, these lyrics resemble a nursery rhyme, and they could be interpreted as referring to either the celebrity feuds or the feelings after a romantic breakup.[17] Swift's character resents that her enemies set her up for humiliation (\"You said the gun was mine/ Isn't cool, no, I don't like you\"), affirms that she remembers all the wrongdoings (\"I got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined/ I check it once, then I check it twice\"),[38] and reassures that her enemies will get what they deserve (\"Maybe I got mine, but you\u2019ll all get yours\").[51]\n\nIn the pre-chorus, Swift's character asserts that she became wiser and hardened, \"I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time.\"[51][52] The chorus is made up of the title, \"Look what you made me do\", repeated eight times;[17] Swift said that this part came when \"the beat hit\" and the production team decided to \"edit out the rest of the words\".[50] In the bridge, Swift's character threatens to give her enemies nightmares (\"I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me/ I\u2019ll be the actress, starring in your bad dreams\") and tells that the old version of her was dead, delivered through a sound effect that resembles a telephone call: \"The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now/ Why?/ 'Cause she's dead\";[46][53] Swift said that these lyrics were the most important part of the song.[50]\n\nAccording to Swift, the song used some tropes from the TV series Game of Thrones: the \"list of names\" was inspired by Arya Stark's \"kill list\", and the \"vibes\" were inspired by the characters Cersei Lannister and Daenerys Targaryen.[54] Although \"Look What You Made Me Do\" does not mention any particular person, many publications interpreted some of its parts as references to the West\u2013Kardashian controversy:[55] \"I don't like your tilted stage\",[17] \"the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now\".[46] Swift confirmed in a 2019 Rolling Stone cover story that the \"phone call\" lyric referred to \"a stupid phone call [she] shouldn't have picked up\".[56] There were also comments that some parts referenced Swift's fallout with Katy Perry[37][53] or her ex-boyfriends Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston.[57]\n\nAccording to Carson, the songwriting contains some of the \"storybook lyricism and fairytale tropes\" that Swift had employed before, such as the imagery of kingdoms and dreams and the idea of revenge, which recalled songs like \"Should've Said No\" (2006), \"Better than Revenge\" (2010), and \"Bad Blood\" (2014);[37] Billboard's Tatiana Cirisano said that the dreams imagery evoked the songs from 1989 such as \"Blank Space\" or \"Wildest Dreams\".[53]\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nUpon release, \"Look What You Made Me Do\" polarized music critics.[33][58] Some considered the single a fierce return and an interesting move for Swift to reclaim her public narrative, whereas others found the production and themes vindictive, harsh, and off-putting.[59] USA Today said that the polarized reaction to the song illustrated Swift's position as a \"ubiquitous cultural force\".[60]\n\nThe Telegraph's Sarah Carson praised the song, deeming Swift and Antonoff's work as \"blowing past the production clich\u00e9s of clap tracks and hiccuped syllabic hooks that have proliferated across Top 40 fare in recent years with boldly inventive textures and fresh melodic, rhythmic and sonic accents\". She also added how the track musically and sonically shifted alongside the lyrics.[37] Randy Lewis of the Los Angeles Times wrote a positive review of the song, saying: \"The reverberating crescendo builds and ever more delicious is the wickedness of Swift's menacing protagonist\", praising Swift for her successful embrace of the villain character the media has portrayed her as previous to the song's release.[38] Variety's Chris Willman also praised Swift's embrace of darker-styled pop music and the stylistic conflict between the song's pre-chorus and chorus.[52] Mark Harris, writing for Vulture, thought of Swift's song as a pop art anthem for the Trump era in how she reappropriates her public feuds as empowering badges of honor without acknowledging her responsibility or blame.[61]\n\nMaura Johnston of The Guardian wrote a negative review of the song, faulting the \"sloppy\" lyrics and blaming Swift for not giving a clear context in the lyrics.[26] Lindsay Zoladz of The Ringer said, \"Unleashed on a deeply confused public late Thursday night, the song is a strange collage of retro reference points: mid-aughts Gossip Girl placement pop, the soundtrack to Disney's live-action Maleficent, and \u2014 yes, really \u2014 Right Said Fred's \"I'm Too Sexy\", except devoid of the self-effacing humor and wit. Yes, the new Taylor Swift song just made me compliment Right Said Fred.\"[62] The single was noted as being darker and angrier than what Swift had done before.[46][63] Meaghan Garvey from Pitchfork referred to it in a review as \"a hardcore self-own\" track.[64]\n\nRetrospective reviews have considered \"Look What You Made Me Do\" a career-defining song for Swift. In 2019, Slant Magazine listed \"Look What You Made Me Do\" as one of the 100 singles that defined the 2010s decade; Sal Cinquemani described it as Swift's first \"bona fide misstep\" but also a bold and authentic artistic work.[65] In 2023, Zoya Raza-Sheikh of The Independent opined that the single portrayed Swift as a \"beleaguered\" pop star.[66]\n\nCommercial performance [ edit ]\n\n\"Look What You Made Me Do\" broke several streaming records upon release.[67][68] In the United States, \"Look What You Made Me Do\" debuted at number 77 on the Billboard Hot 100, with that week's chart capturing its first three days of airplay.[69] It also sold slightly under 200,000 digital copies within its first day of sales in the country, where it became the fastest-selling download since Ed Sheeran's \"Shape of You\".[70] One week later, the song ascended from number 77 to number one on the Hot 100 after its first full week of tracking, becoming the fifth-largest rise to the top position and Swift's fifth number-one single in the United States, as well as her biggest-jump single chart, surpassing \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" (2012), which debuted at number 72 and topped the American charts one week later. Ending the record-tying 16-week reign of Luis Fonsi's \"Despacito\", \"Look What You Made Me Do\" became one of the most dominant number-one hits of all time, leading ahead of \"Despacito\" with more than double the Hot 100 points.[71]\n\nThe song also topped the nation's Streaming Songs chart with 84.4 million streams, becoming its most streamed song within a week by a female artist at the time and second overall behind the 103 million that Baauer's \"Harlem Shake\" gained in 2013. The track also had more weekly streams in the US than any other song in 2017. The song stayed atop the charts for three consecutive weeks, tying with American rapper Cardi B's \"Bodak Yellow\" as the longest-running female at the number one spot on the charts in 2017.[71]\n\nWith 353,000 copies sold in its first week, \"Look What You Made Me Do\" opened atop the US Digital Songs chart and had the country's biggest sales opening since Justin Timberlake's \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\" in 2016 as well as the best weekly sales for a song by a female artist since Adele's \"Hello\" in 2015. The track also became the country's first number-one song by a female artist since Sia's \"Cheap Thrills\" (both in 2016). It additionally was the first solo song by a female to top the US charts since \"Hello\".[71] It remained atop the Hot 100 and Streaming Songs charts for a second week with 114,000 copies sold and 61.2 million streams. That week, it was bumped to number two on the Digital Songs chart by Swift's track \"...Ready for It?\", which debuted at number one with 135,000 digital copies sold. As a result, Swift became the first artist to have two tracks sell over 100,000 digital copies in the nation within a week since Sheeran did so with \"Shape of You\" and \"Castle on the Hill\". It also became the first time a female had two songs within the top five of the Hot 100 since 2015 when Swift's songs \"Blank Space\" and \"Shake It Off\" respectively were at numbers four and five on the chart.[72] The single also topped the Mainstream Top 40 chart, becoming Swift's eighth single to do so.[73]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Look What You Made Me Do\" sold 20,000 copies and was streamed 2.4 million times in less than a week.[74] The song debuted at the top of the UK Singles Chart on September 1, 2017 \u2013 for the week ending date September 7, 2017, with opening sales of 30,000 copies and 5.3 million streams within the week and becoming Swift's first chart-topping song in Britain.[75] It spent two weeks at the top spot.[76] As of December 2022, \"Look What You Made Me Do\" has sold over one million combined units in the UK.[77]\n\n\"Look What You Made Me Do\" also debuted at number one on the Irish Singles Chart on September 1, 2017, and became Swift's first song to top the chart in Ireland. \"Look What You Made Me Do\" opened at number one in Australia on September 2, 2017, becoming her fifth track to top the ARIA Charts.[78] It spent another week at the summit.[79] The song has been certified seven-times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).[80] After debuting at number one on the Canadian Hot 100,[81] \"Look What You Made Me Do\" was also certified Platinum by Music Canada for shipments of 80,000 units on September 14, 2017.[82] In New Zealand, \"Look What You Made Me Do\" entered the number one spot on September 4, 2017, becoming Swift's fourth chart-topping single there.[83] In the Philippines, \"Look What You Made Me Do\" debuted at number seven on the Philippine Hot 100 in its first week. A week later, it ascended to the number one spot, ending the ten-week reign of \"Despacito\".[84]\n\nMusic video [ edit ]\n\nProduction and release [ edit ]\n\nPreparation for the music video began in January 2017, while the shooting took place in May.[85][86] The dance was choreographed by Tyce Diorio, who had previously worked with Swift on the video for her 2014 single \"Shake It Off\".[85] Swift's makeup as a zombie was done by Bill Corso.[86] Post-production of the video lasted until the morning of its release date.[86] A 20-second music video teaser was released on Good Morning America on August 25.[87]\n\nThe song's music video premiered on August 27, 2017, at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.[88] The video broke the record for the most-watched video within 24 hours by achieving 43.2 million views on YouTube on its first day.[89] It topped the 27.7 million Vevo views Adele's \"Hello\" attracted in that timeframe, as well as the 36 million YouTube views of Psy's \"Gentleman\" video.[90][91][92] It was viewed at an average 30,000 times per minute in its first 24 hours, with views reaching over three million views per hour.[89] The video was named the fifth-best music video of 2017 by Rolling Stone[93] and the seventh-best music video of 2017 by Billboard.[94] In 2020, Parade ranked the video 20th on the list of 71 Best Music Videos of All Time.[95]\n\nSynopsis [ edit ]\n\nThe bathtub scene in the music video. The diamonds used were said to be authentic and worth over $10 million, and a lone dollar bill can be seen.\n\nSwift has said that part of the premise of the video is rooted in the idea that, \"If everything you write about me was true, this is how ridiculous it would look.\"[96] It is a satirical send-up of media theories about her true intentions that have little validity. The video begins with an overhead shot of a cemetery before the camera zooms in on a grave with a headstone that reads \"Here lies Taylor Swift's reputation.\" After that, a zombie Swift, wearing the dress from her \"Out of the Woods\" music video, crawls out of the grave before proceeding to dig another grave for her Met Gala 2014 self. The next scene shows Swift in a bathtub filled with diamonds, with a necklace spelling out \"No\" next to a ring, supposedly sending up tabloid press rumors of her past romantic relationships. She is then seen seated on a throne while snakes surround her and serve tea. Swift later crashes her golden Bugatti Veyron on a post and sings the song's chorus holding a Grammy as the paparazzi take photos. She is also seen swinging inside a golden cage, robbing a streaming company in a cat mask, and leading a motorcycle gang. Afterward, she gathers a group of women at \"Squad U\" and dances with a group of men in another room. Then, she is seen standing on top of the wing of a plane in an airport hangar, sawing off the wing in half and spray-painting \"reputation\" in pink on the side of the plane. At the video's climax, Swift is seen standing on a T-shaped throne mountain while clones of herself (from her past music videos, stage performances, and red-carpet appearances) struggle and fight against each other trying to reach her. The Swift at the top of the mountain stretches out her arms, and many of the other Swifts fall off the mountain, while Swift from another scene picks up a phone and says \"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now. Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!\" The video concludes with a scene of a line-up of surviving Swift clones bowing in the hangar while Swift stands and watches on the wing of the plane. The clones bicker with one another, describing each other as \"so fake\" and \"playing the victim\". The 2009 VMA Swift clone then says \"I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative\", resulting in the other Swifts yelling at her to \"shut up!\" in unison.[97][98]\n\nSeveral scenes from the music video were compared to the works of Croatian singer Severina, particularly the scene with the group of women at \"Squad U\" and the scene with the T-shaped throne. The former was compared to her 2016 music video for \"Silikoni\", and the latter was compared to the performances from her 2013 Dobrodo\u0161ao u Klub Tour.[99][100][101]\n\nAnalysis [ edit ]\n\nThe video contains numerous hidden meanings and references. In the opening scene, there is a subtle \"Nils Sj\u00f6berg\" tombstone shown when Swift is digging up a grave, referencing the pseudonym she used for a songwriting credit on Calvin Harris' 2016 single \"This Is What You Came For\".[102] Similarly, Swift\u2014masked as a cadaveric version of herself in the \"Out of the Woods\" music video\u2014was shown digging a grave for herself in the gown worn to the 2014 Met Gala.[103] The zombie Swift rising from her supposed \"grave\" is also speculated to be a subtle reference to Michael Jackson's Thriller music video, which showcases a zombie rising from their grave very similarly to the position Swift was in.[104][105] A single dollar bill in the bathtub full of diamonds that she bathes in was also speculated to symbolize the dollar she was awarded for winning a sexual assault trial earlier in 2017.[102] Interpretations for the bathtub scene were contrasting. Some believe that it is a response to media statements teasing that she \"cries in a marble bathtub surrounded by pearls\" with the necklace spelling \"no\" next to a ring sending up tabloid media rumors of her relationships.[106] Others speculate that the bathtub scene is a jibe at Kim Kardashian, the then-wife of Swift's long-time feuding partner, Kanye West. Some viewers took the scene as a reference to Kardashian's 2016 robbery, in which she was robbed of jewelry worth over $10 million while held at gunpoint at a hotel in Paris, France.[107][108]\n\nIn a separate scene, Swift is shown sitting atop a golden throne, where a carving of the phrase \"Et tu, Brute?\" could be seen on the armrest, a reference to William Shakespeare's drama Julius Caesar.[102] Swift's infamous title as a \"snake\" during her hiatus[109] was also represented when a snake slithers onto the throne to serve Swift some tea. The scene where Swift's car crashes and is surrounded by paparazzi was speculated by some to be a jab at Katy Perry, as Swift's hairstyle is similar to Perry's in the scene and the car crash itself is reminiscent of the one in Perry's music video for \"Unconditionally\" (2013). The sports car was also suspected to be a reminder of a car in Perry's \"Waking Up in Vegas\" (2009) video, which Kahn also directed. However, given the video's theme of mocking the media, the car crash scene likely makes fun of the theory that Swift's real fallout with Perry was a dramatized act for publicity and album material. Swift is ridiculing the idea that she would damage her friendships for business gains, with the car crash being a metaphor for her feud with Perry and the Grammy Award in her hands in the wreckage symbolizing the awards won from the songs \"inspired\" by the aforementioned feud. Swift's withdrawal of her entire music catalog from streaming services and the media's claims that she was doing this for greed and to start her streaming company was hinted at when Swift and her crew robbed a streaming company's money vault in the video.[110]\n\nSwift leading an army of tall, skinny, and robotic women at a \"Squad U\" gathering poked fun at the media's accusations that her close group of friends were artificial and had unrealistic body shapes.[102] During the second chorus, Swift is seen with eight men, each of whom revealed an \"I Heart TS\" crop top after unbuttoning a jacket at her command. This scene mocks the idea that Swift forced her then-boyfriend Tom Hiddleston to wear an \"I Heart TS\" tank top. During the bridge, Swift stands on a mountain of clones of her past selves, which reiterates that she is leaving behind her \"America's Sweetheart\" image and embracing her newfound role as an evil \"snake\". The clones are wearing various noteworthy outfits that Swift herself previously wore. The shirt that her \"You Belong with Me\" music video clone wears, however, is slightly different from the original one: this time, the names of her current close friends are scribbled on it.[110]\n\nThe video's ending features an assembly of \"old Taylors\" in front of a private jet who are talking amongst one another and making snide references to the many false and exaggerated media portrayals of her throughout her career. These include claims that Swift fakes her classic surprised face at award shows; that her \"nice girl\" fa\u00e7ade masks a truly mean, manipulative personality; accusations that Swift always plays the victim instead of taking responsibility for her actions and decisions; and numerous mentions of her 2016 feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, ignited by the release of his 2016 song \"Famous\". Examples include the \"that bitch\" line in \"Famous\" which Swift had disapproved of, and Kardashian illegally recording and editing Swift's phone call with West.[111] In June 2016, discussing the relationship between her and West after the release of \"Famous\", Swift wrote on Instagram, \"I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative.\"[112] The same line is spoken by the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards Taylor clone just before the video ends.[113][114] She is wearing the same outfit Swift had worn during the actual 2009 MTV Video Music Awards when West infamously interrupted her acceptance speech for the Best Female Video award and ignited tensions between the two for the first time.[115]\n\nLive performances and other uses [ edit ]\n\nSwift performed \"Look What You Made Me Do\" live for the first time as part of the KIIS-FM Jingle Ball 2017 on December 1, 2017, in Inglewood, California.[116] Two days later, Swift returned onstage to perform the song again as part of 99.7 Now!'s Poptopia in San Jose, California with the same setlist.[117] The next week Swift sang the song on three other occasions; the B96 Chicago and Pepsi Jingle Bash 2017 in Chicago, the Z100 Jingle Ball 2017 in New York City, and the Jingle Bell Ball 2017 in London.[118][119][120]\n\nThe song was also a regular part of her set list for the Reputation Stadium Tour, with a tilted throne and golden snakes; while there are snakes on the high screen in the back during the part where she sings, \"I don't trust nobody and nobody trust me, I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams\", a large floating cobra appears onstage with the line from the bridge announcing the death of the \"Old Taylor\" spoken by comedian Tiffany Haddish.[121][122] Swift included \"Look What You Made Me Do\" on the set list of the Eras Tour (2023\u20132024).[123] On the Eras Tour, while Swift is performing \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" she is surrounded by her backup singers and dancers, who are dressed as various past versions of herself and trapped inside large clear boxes.[124] This iconography is similar to that which was used in the music video. Prior to the announcement and release of Speak Now (Taylor's Version), many fans noticed Taylor pounding on the box with the dancer dressed in the Speak-Now-era purple halter dress, and speculated that this interaction signaled that Speak Now would be the next album to be rerecorded.[125]\n\nABC used \"Look What You Made Me Do\" in a promotional video for its Shonda Rhimes' Thursday line-up an hour after its release.[126] ESPN used the song in Saturday Night Football advertisements for the season-opening game between Alabama and Florida State, which was aired on ABC on September 2 along with her other song \"...Ready for It?\".[127] In the South Park episode \"Moss Piglets\", the water bears in Timmy and Jimmy's experiment for the science fair dance to the song in response to Swift's singing. The song was used in the trailer for the 2019 comedy film Murder Mystery.[128] American actress Reese Witherspoon performs the song for the jukebox musical film, Sing 2, in the role of Rosita.[129]\n\nA cover version of \"Look What You Made Me Do\" was recorded by the band Jack Leopards & the Dolphin Club, and produced by Antonoff and Nils Sj\u00f6berg, the latter being a pseudonym that Swift first used as a co-writer for the song \"This Is What You Came For\" by Calvin Harris featuring Rihanna. The cover was featured in the opening credits of \"Beautiful Monster\", an episode of the television show Killing Eve that aired on May 24, 2020, and subsequently released on digital music platforms. There is no documentation of the band's existence before the release of the cover,[130] and it was speculated the person singing was Swift's brother Austin Swift.[131][132] Fans also interpreted the cover to be Swift's way of bypassing potential licensing issues with her former label Big Machine Records and its owner Scooter Braun, with whom Swift is involved in a dispute regarding Braun's acquisition of the label and, subsequently, the master recordings of her back catalogue.[133]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nCredits and personnel [ edit ]\n\nCredits are adapted from the liner notes of Reputation.[35]\n\nCharts [ edit ]\n\nCertifications [ edit ]\n\nRelease history [ edit ]\n\n\"Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor's Version)\" [ edit ]\n\nAfter signing a new contract with Republic Records, Swift began re-recording her first six studio albums in November 2020.[249] The decision followed a public 2019 dispute between Swift and the talent manager Scooter Braun, who acquired Big Machine Records, including the masters of Swift's albums which the label had released.[250][251] By re-recording the albums, Swift had full ownership of the new masters, which enabled her to control the licensing of her songs for commercial use and therefore substituted the Big Machine\u2013owned masters.[252] The re-recorded albums and songs are identified with an extended \"Taylor's Version\" moniker.\n\nOn August 23, 2023, the re-recorded song \"Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor's Version)\" was teased in a trailer for the Amazon Prime Video series Wilderness, released on September 15, 2023; it was later also used as the show's theme song.[254][255] The full first and second verses and the two choruses of the song were used in the opening scene of the penultimate episode of The Handmaid's Tale, released on May 20, 2025. Billboard wrote that the re-recording features recreations of the original synths and beats, while Swift's vocals are from \"an older, more experienced Swift\".[256]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ec/Taylor_Swift_The_Eras_Tour_Reputation_Era_Set_%2853109853495%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/250px-Taylor_Swift_The_Eras_Tour_Reputation_Era_Set_%2853109853495%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/68/Taylor_Swift_-_Look_What_You_Made_Me_Do.png/250px-Taylor_Swift_-_Look_What_You_Made_Me_Do.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f0/Taylor_Swift_-_Look_What_You_Made_Me_Do_%28music_video_screenshot%29.png/250px-Taylor_Swift_-_Look_What_You_Made_Me_Do_%28music_video_screenshot%29.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e0/Taylor_Swift_-_Reputation_Tour_Seattle_-_Look_What_You_Made_Me_Do_%28cropped%29.jpg/250px-Taylor_Swift_-_Reputation_Tour_Seattle_-_Look_What_You_Made_Me_Do_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/60px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/68/Taylor_Swift_-_Look_What_You_Made_Me_Do.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/20px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/68/Taylor_Swift_-_Look_What_You_Made_Me_Do.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look_What_You_Made_Me_Do", "title": "Look What You Made Me Do", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/68/Taylor_Swift_-_Look_What_You_Made_Me_Do.png", "width": 1200, "height": 1060}, "title": "Look What You Made Me Do - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
