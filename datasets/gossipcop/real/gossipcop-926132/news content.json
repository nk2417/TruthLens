People took to social media to show their support and excitement, including Cardi\u2019s little sister Hennessy. Her Instagram-fingers might have been typing too fast because she may have revealed Offset and the Bronx native are expecting a baby girl.\n\nHennessy posted a still shot of her sister in the form-fitting white dress she rocked for Saturday Night Live along with a heartfelt caption congratulating Cardi. Hennessy wished her well , saying Cardi always wanted to be a mom and now it\u2019s finally happening.\n\n\u201cYou always been like a second mom to me so I know you gonna be the best mommy everrrr,\u201d Hennessy wrote initially, according to The Shade Room. \u201cGrowing up, you would always break me off a piece of your plate without asking \u2026 and now that baby Cardi coming is like it\u2019s coming true! I\u2019m going to be able to hold baby you and give her all the kisses and hugs! Your pregnancy is mine we pregnant can\u2019t believe we\u2019re having a baby! I\u2019m passing my daughter crown down.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BhVTjPuAGiT/?taken-by=hennessycarolina\n\nThe Shade Room is quick with the screenshots and snapped the caption before Hennessy made minor corrections to the captions, changing \u201cbaby Cardi\u201d to \u201cur baby,\u201d swapping the pronouns \u201cher\u201d for \u201cthe baby\u201d and altogether deleting \u201cI\u2019m passing my daughter crown down.\u201d\n\nCardi hasn\u2019t confirmed the gender of her child. Just like the \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d spitter waited until the right time for her to reveal to the world she\u2019s bringing a new life, she\u2019ll do the same for the gender reveal.\n\nShe released her debut album Invasion of Privacy last Friday (April 6) and it\u2019s already certified gold.", "images": ["https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-vibe-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cardi-b-explains-why-concealed-pregnancy-saturday-night-live-1523279632-640x4271-1523294614.jpg?w=640", "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cardi-b-explains-why-concealed-pregnancy-saturday-night-live-1523279632-640x4271-1523294614.jpg?w=640&h=427&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cardi-b-explains-why-concealed-pregnancy-saturday-night-live-1523279632-640x4271-1523294614.jpg?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sierra Brown", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vibe.com/music/music-news/cardi-b-sister-reveal-baby-gender-578431/", "title": "Did Cardi B\u2019s Sister Accidentally Give A Gender Reveal?", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-vibe-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/cropped-VIBE_favicon.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Before deleting her Instagram post which identified the gender of Cardi B's baby, Hennessy", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Sierra Brown", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Did Cardi B\u2019s Sister Accidentally Give A Gender Reveal?", "url": "https://www.vibe.com/music/music-news/cardi-b-sister-reveal-baby-gender-578431/", "description": "Before deleting her Instagram post which identified the gender of Cardi B's baby, Hennessy", "site_name": "VIBE.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cardi-b-explains-why-concealed-pregnancy-saturday-night-live-1523279632-640x4271-1523294614.jpg?w=640", "width": 640, "height": 427, "alt": "cardi-b-sister-accidentally-reveals-baby-gener"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-09T17:25:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-09T17:25:54+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Before deleting her Instagram post which identified the gender of Cardi B's baby, Hennessy", "site": "@vibemagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Did Cardi B\u2019s Sister Accidentally Give A Gender Reveal?", "image": "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cardi-b-explains-why-concealed-pregnancy-saturday-night-live-1523279632-640x4271-1523294614.jpg?w=640"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523294754.0, "source": "https://www.vibe.com", "summary": ""}
