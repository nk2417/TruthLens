While attending the premiere of her upcoming movie, The Post, Streep addressed the joke the actor recently made about her being \u201chigh maintenance,\u201d reports E! Online.\n\nShe said, \u201cJust check the amount of time he took in hair and makeup and how much I did, and you\u2019ll find out who\u2019s high maintenance.\u201d\n\nThe three-time Oscar winner also dropped a little trivia about the phrase and its relation to the film.\n\n\u201cBy the way, the movie is dedicated to Nora Ephron, who claims that phrase \u2013 high maintenance \u2013 as her own,\u201d noted Streep.\n\nA couple of days back, while appearing on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, Hanks jokingly said that his The Post co-star was \u201chigh maintenance.\u201d\n\nAfter host Stephen Colbert explained to Hanks that many people trust him, including his co-star (Streep), Hanks playfully rolled his eyes and said, \u201cYou mean, can I just say, high-maintenance Meryl Streep?\u201d Sharing his experience of working with Meryl Hank said, \u201cShe was mad at me because I didn\u2019t tell her Steven doesn\u2019t rehearse. He just wants to figure it out as he goes along. He\u2019s almost like a guerrilla filmmaker.\u201d\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe Post tells the story of Ben Bradlee (Hanks) and Katharine Graham (Streep), and Graham\u2019s decision to publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971, at the risk of losing her family-owned newspaper.\n\nThe flick is slated to hit US theatres on December 22.", "images":
