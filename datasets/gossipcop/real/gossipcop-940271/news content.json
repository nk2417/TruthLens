She will enter a plea to a lesser misdemeanor charge, her attorney said.\n\nHow to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of New York City on Bravo and Peacock.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New York City singer was arrested in Palm Beach on Christmas Eve last year on charges of battery on an officer, disorderly intoxication, resisting arrest with violence, and crimes against a person, the Palm Beach Post reported at the time. Luann reportedly pleaded not guilty following her arrest, according to TMZ. She rejected a plea deal in connection with the case in February.\n\nThe judge set a court date for July 25 during which Luann is set to plead guilty in absentia and the adjudication will be withheld, her attorney said, according to CBS12.com.\n\nRHONY fans saw Luann in the moments leading up to her arrest, as well as footage of the incident and her mugshot in Wednesday night's episode (clip above). We'll see the aftermath of Luann's arrest in next Wednesday night's episode of RHONY at 9/8c.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the below preview clip from the episode, Luann explains that she flew to Palm Beach to spend time with a friend on her way to a wedding in Chile and to also spend Christmas with her family in Jupiter, Florida. While there, Luann ended up visiting several places she used to frequent when she was with her now-ex-husband Tom D'Agostino. \"I thought I could handle it, but let me tell you, all these emotions coming back, all these memories came back. And, you know, I'm not blaming it on that, per se, it's just that all of it together was just too much for me to handle,\" Luann tells Dorinda Medley on the phone in the clip. \"I'm not proud of what happened, that's for sure. I'm not proud of what I did, but I'm learning a lot about myself. I found the right place to be to take care of myself.\"\n\nLuann Checks in With Dorinda After Her Arrest\n\n\n\n\n\nNot long after her arrest, Luann checked herself into an alcohol treatment center, where she stayed for 21 days before returning home in January. Luann opened up to The Daily Dish earlier this season about how we'll see her \"crash and burn\" and then \"rise like a phoenix.\" \"I think when you're happy, you always look better, and I'm happy that I lost weight because I stopped drinking, which is good. So I'm less puffy. I feel so much better. And I feel like when you feel good about yourself, it comes shining through,\" she shared. \"There's a big change in my life in terms of being in control, being in power, being in the driver's seat, and I feel like with the drinking, I definitely was not in the driver's seat.\"\n\nWatch Luann open up more about her journey this year, below.", "images":
