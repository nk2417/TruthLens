The rest of the clip tells the story of a couple who met, fell in love, married and had a child before one partner tragically passed away.\n\nIn a behind-the-scenes peek shared by E! News, Ballerini detailed the inspiration behind the song, noting that while she wrote it from a breakup, the song\u2019s general message is one of loss.\n\n\u201cIt brings me back to the heartbreak I wrote it from, it makes me think of my fans and the journey we\u2019ve shared, and now I sing it from the perspective of a legendary love story,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope everyone hears something in it that brings them to a place of nostalgia and is as excited as I am to begin this next chapter together.\u201d\n\nMore: Kelsea Ballerini Makes Unexpected Announcement on Social Media\n\nDuring a recent press event in Nashville, the 23-year-old shared that she had a vision for the music video the moment she heard the song\u2019s demo.\n\n\u201cI wrote this song two years ago, and the day we wrote it, Forest sent me the demo,\u201d she explained, via Billboard. \u201cI listened to it, and all I could see was a car wreck. God willing, I\u2019ve never had anyone close to me in a car wreck or anything like that, but it was a really strong visual that I saw. I think to me it made the song more about general loss than heartbreak. I wanted the song to be bigger than heartbreak. I think the video captured that.\u201d\n\nBallerini recently announced that her second album, Unapologetically, will be released Nov. 3.\n\nPhoto Credit: YouTube / KelseaBalleriniVEVO", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/09/4c58a6b2-6e11-42c4-9c28-bbf2485e7fd7.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/04/70839b1d-3826-4242-9848-ca2fff9b687f.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/the-real-housewives-of-orange-county-logo-1.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hannah Barnes", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/country-music/news/kelsea-ballerini-legends-music-video-behind-the-scenes/", "title": "Watch: Kelsea Ballerini Is Legendary in New Behind-the-Scenes Look at \u2018Legends\u2019 Video", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Watch: Kelsea Ballerini Is Legendary in New Behind-the-Scenes Look at 'Legends' Video", "description": "Kelsea Ballerini released her latest single, \u201cLegends,\u201d in June, and the accompanying music video dropped soon after to give fans a taste of what they could expect from the country star\u2019s sophomore album.
