The 35-year-old pop megastar\u2014who just released her latest album, Life of a Showgirl\u2014is worth an estimated $1.1 billion, according to Forbes, $150 million of which she has invested in real estate.\n\nWhat was Swift's first real estate investment?\n\nSwift has come a long way, from country girl to global pop star. Her rise to the top began on a Christmas tree farm in Cumru Township, Pennsylvania, before the Swift family moved 15 minutes away to a five-bedroom home in Wyomissing, just outside of Reading, Pennsylvania. It was in a Georgian Colonial\u2013style home that she first began to exhibit an interest in music and started to play guitar. At 14, Swift convinced her parents to move to Nashville to pursue her music career\u2014which is where she made her first official real estate purchase, in 2009, a condo that she still owns today.\n\nWhat about now?\n\nSwift has been shaking off doubters ever since, winning 14 Grammy awards so far. But it's her relationship with NFL star Travis Kelce that everyone still can\u2019t stop talking about, from on-field kisses after games to date nights in New York City. The couple announced their engagement in August 2025, and since then, they've been spotted house hunting in Ohio. Wedding planning is officially underway, and while the couple is keeping details under wraps, wedding speculation is at an all-time high, and fans are wondering if the expanded Rhode Island mansion might serve as the perfect venue for their nuptials.\n\nWhat does Swift's real estate portfolio include?\n\nSwift has amassed eight diverse pads, ranging from a $150 million penthouse in Manhattan\u2019s Tribeca neighborhood to an 11,000-square-foot historic landmark in California. And on the heels of a two-year-long world tour that made her a billionaire, there\u2019s no telling how much more she\u2019ll conquer in the kingdom of real estate (and what new songs she\u2019ll sing about them). Plus, with her engagement to Kelce and reports of Ohio house hunting, her real estate empire may soon expand beyond eight properties\u2014potentially adding a ninth to accommodate their new chapter together.\n\nCurious to see the spaces Swift inhabits? See below for a closer look at the star\u2019s properties.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/t-swift-645e8c3bef56d.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top",
