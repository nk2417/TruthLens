Proving that his hard work is paying off, the actor regularly tackles ninja warrior courses, jumping from rope to rope, lifting tyres and completing non-stop pull-ups on the beaches of California, in addition to hours spent in the gym each day.\n\nZac Efron may have been blessed with undeniably good genetics, but make no mistake: The lean physique he showcases in Baywatch has been earned.\n\nThe average preparation time for Hollywood training usually lands somewhere around four to six weeks, but Efron started the work eight months before the cameras were on.\n\n\u201cI have been training actors for 20 years and I have never seen anything quite like his work ethic,\u201d says Efron\u2019s trainer Patrick Murphy. \u201cHe was crushing two sessions a day, doing lifeguard courses, and then going on 20-mile bike rides. There is a laser focus he has about his training. On top of that, I never once heard him groan about doing another rep.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatrick\u2019s training was confusing at first,\u201d Efron says. \u201cHe pushed me to my limits with a very multifaceted style: strength, explosiveness, fast-paced, calculated, diverse, and gut-wrenching workouts. It was fun \u2026 you never know what he\u2019s going to throw at you the next day.\u201d\n\nIn terms of nutrition, he follows a strict diet, including several nine day detox cures in which sugar and carbohydrates are off limits, to be replaced by as many organic vegetables and lean proteins as he likes. 12 weeks of training later, the result is a sharply toned silhouette with rock hard abs and pecs and little over 5% body fat \u2013 the average is somewhere between 15% and 30%.\n\nA quick glimpse into the life of a fitness fanatic, via his Instagram.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BHd80d8gDKl/?taken-by=zacefron\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BFrFzgMG81i/?taken-by=zacefron\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BEppks3m82L/?taken-by=zacefron\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BC-rGZ5G8_d/?taken-by=zacefron\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BCma0nYG888/?taken-by=zacefron\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BBYSMbwm86R/?taken-by=zacefron\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BJBkREWAo2M/?taken-by=zacefron", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 364 205'%2F%3E", "https://madnessmedia.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/logo-5.png", "https://madnessmedia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/YoutubeThumb-15-1.png", "data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 758 426'%2F%3E", "data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg xmlns%3D'http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg' viewBox%3D'0 0 364 156'%2F%3E"], "top_img": "https://madnessmedia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/YoutubeThumb-15-1.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madness Media"], "canonical_link": "https://madnessmedia.net/zac-efron-workouts/", "title": "Zac Efron\u2019s workout more intense than you imagined", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, height=device-height, width=device-width", "description": "Zac Efron is one of the fittest male celebrities and he has spent years bulking up with a grueling workout routine.\u00a0Proving that his hard work is paying", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Zac Efron's workout more intense than you imagined | 2025", "description": "Zac Efron is one of the fittest male celebrities and he has spent years bulking up with a grueling workout routine.\u00a0Proving that his hard work is paying", "url": "https://madnessmedia.net/zac-efron-workouts/", "site_name": "Madness Media", "image": {"identifier": "https://madnessmedia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/YoutubeThumb-15-1.png", "width": 1140, "height": 640, "type": "image/png"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2024-10-17T06:51:07+00:00"}, "author": "Madness Media", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Madness Media", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "fb": {"pages": 282360368495040, "app_id": 491917927668509}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://madnessmedia.net/zac-efron-workouts/?ia_markup=1"}, "exoclick-site-verification": "807db1690a9accac8a145745107a0706", "ir-site-verification-token": 16977712, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://madnessmedia.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cropped-logo-2-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1729147867.0, "source": "https://madnessmedia.net", "summary": ""}
