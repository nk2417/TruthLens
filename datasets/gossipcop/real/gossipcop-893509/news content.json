The Patty Jenkins-directed film was set to be released on Dec. 13, 2019.\n\nThe news comes after Disney and Lucasfilm moved Star Wars: Episode IX to Dec. 20, 2019, in September.\n\nThe first Wonder Woman delivered $400 million domestically this summer and topped the box office for its first two weeks of release. If its sequel was released Dec. 13 next year as had been planned, it would be almost certainly struck down to the chart\u2019s second position one week later by Episode IX. Opening the film earlier gives it plenty of runway to potentially continue dominating before the J.J. Abrams-directed Star Wars sequel storms theaters.\n\nWonder Woman 2 will also be shown in IMAX, Warner Bros. added.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gettyimages-682886030.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gettyimages-873077578.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gal-gadot-brooklynn-prince.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/shutterstock_editorial_9220281u_huge.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1204.2857142857px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/wonderwoman.jpg?crop=0px%2C79px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-13-at-7-51-27-am.png?crop=249px%2C0px%2C2202px%2C1473.2428571429px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/000266619hr.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/plummer.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/murder-on-the-orient-express-df-00620_rv2_rgb.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/gettyimages-802222006.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/gettyimages-8144920521.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/wonderwoman.jpg?crop=0px%2C79px%2C2700px%2C1419px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Hibberd"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171114025233/http://ew.com/movies/2017/11/13/wonder-woman-2-star-wars/", "title": "Wonder Woman 2 gets new release date away from Star Wars", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1143086910", "description": "[bc_video video_id=\"5522059294001\" account_id=\"219646971\" player_id=\"default\"] Did Star Wars just force-push Wonder Woman off her release date?
