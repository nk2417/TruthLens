The 27-year-old singer first shared a mysterious photo of herself and Payne staring into the camera, before posting a video previewing the music.\n\n\"Something special #ForYou coming in January... #FiftyShadesFreed @liampayne,\" she captioned the post.\n\nOra is gearing up to release her first album in five years, and recently sat down with ET to discuss what it was like to step back in the studio again -- and reconnect with some of her old friends, like Ed Sheeran.\n\n\"It's finally been a moment where I can actually just really show off my musical talent with some of the most amazing people that I've met in this journey. And I just felt like, as humble as I can say this, it's about time,\" she said. \"I do really feel that, so I'm so happy that everybody kind of loves the songs. Everyone's just really being positive, so it's lovely.\"\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-08/et_RitaOraINTV_hulu.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/1280_rita_ora_getty886767392.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_intv_rita_ora_110317.jpg?h=d191ef15&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-07/1280_rita_ora_071717_getty816146974.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/1280_rita_ora_getty886767392.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1024&quality=80"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/1280_rita_ora_getty886767392.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/rita-ora-teases-fifty-shades-freed-collaboration-liam-payne-93111", "title": "Rita Ora Teases 'Fifty Shades Freed' Collaboration With Liam Payne", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/1280_rita_ora_getty886767392.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Fifty Shades of One Direction!", "title": "Rita Ora Teases 'Fifty Shades Freed' Collaboration With Liam Payne", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/rita-ora-teases-fifty-shades-freed-collaboration-liam-payne-93111", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Fifty Shades of One Direction!", "twitter": {"description": "Fifty Shades of One Direction!", "title": "Rita Ora Teases 'Fifty Shades Freed' Collaboration With Liam Payne", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/rita-ora-teases-fifty-shades-freed-collaboration-liam-payne-93111", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/1280_rita_ora_getty886767392.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Rita Ora Teases 'Fifty Shades Freed' Collaboration With Liam Payne | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, Music, Movies, News, Rita Ora, Liam Payne, Fifty Shades Freed", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
