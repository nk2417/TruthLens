Markle served as Roth's maid of honor at her 2016 wedding in New York.\n\nHeather Dorak, a Pilates entrepreneur and old California friend whom Markle has credited for her toned physique, flew in from the U.S. for the celebration. Markle spent time with Dorak last Christmas after her relationship with Harry went public.\n\nMissing from the celebration was Jessica Mulroney, her stylist and constant companion from Toronto who is assisting Markle in wedding planning. Mulroney did attend Markle's baptism earlier this month, as well as the dinner afterwards hosted by Harry's father, Prince Charles, and stepmother, Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.\n\nJessica Mulroney and actress Meghan Markle attend the World Vision event held at Lumas Gallery, March 22, 2016, in Toronto.

Ragland, who lives in California, is expected soon in London as Markle puts the finishing touches on her May 19 wedding at Windsor Castle.\n\nSoho Farmhouse, in the English countryside, has a special place in Markle's heart. Not only have she and Harry spent quiet private weekends there away from the long lens of the paparazzi, she\u2019s also previously enjoyed girls' trips there.\n\nBritain's Prince Harry leaves with his fiancee, U.S. actress Meghan Markle after attending a Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey in central London, March 12, 2018.
