Ventriloquist and national sensation Darci Lynne Farmer won the \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d season 12 title on Wednesday.\n\nThroughout the season, she seemed to handle the pressure like a total pro. Still, you have to wonder what went through her brain as she stood on that finale stage waiting for the big announcement. Farmer admitted her nerves almost got the better of her.\n\nIt's Darci Lynne/Facebook\n\n\u201cI was so stressed out. That was the longest 30 seconds of my life,\u201d Farmer told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cI was, like, just spit it out Ty Ty! \u201d\n\nAnd how adorable did she look when she found out she won?\n\nFarmer\u2019s win capped off a run that began with her getting Mel B\u2019s golden buzzer at the start of the season. The young girl and her bunny, Petunia, sang a rousing rendition of \u201cSummertime\u2019 and captured the judge\u2019s heart, along with the rest of America. In the end, the viewers voted to give Farmer the \u201cAGT\u201d title and prizes.\n\nWatch her winning performance below:\n\nSo, what\u2019s in store for Miss Darci Lynne and her menagerie now that the season ended? The ventriloquist took some time away from her beloved puppets to share her plans for some of the $1 million prize money.\n\n\u201cFirst, I am definitely going to give some money to my mission program at church, and then I have to get my mom a dishwasher,\u201d Farmer said. \u201cThen I\u2019m definitely going to get a pug, because I really want one\u2014if my parents let me.\u201d\n\nSure, she\u2019s a television star, but it\u2019s great to see she\u2019s still a little girl who wants a new puppy. And, kudos to her for wanting to take care of mom and her church, too!\n\nHey guys, I know it's been a day, but I wanted say thanks for the experience of a lifetime!!! I cannot thank y'all enough!\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f#blessed @AGT pic.twitter.com/M5a4F1GDjZ \u2014 Darci Lynne (@ItsDarciLynne) September 21, 2017\n\nBut Farmer won\u2019t spend that $1 million too soon. In fact, Forbes published a report about how \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d pays out the prize money. The winning contestant has two choices:\n\nReceive the $1 million prize as an annuity paid out over 40 years. This equals about $25,000 per year before taxes.\n\nGet a lump sum payment for approximately $300,000 before taxes.\n\nAnd in case you\u2019re worried about going through Darci Lynne withdrawal now that the AGT season has ended, don\u2019t worry: Farmer and her furry, talkative friends will soon headline a couple shows in Las Vegas that super fans can try to catch.\n\nThe morning after the live season finale, \u201cAGT\u201d tweeted details about the show.\n\nThe show runs for two performances (Nov. 2 and Nov. 3) at the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino. In addition to Farmer\u2019s headlining act, the audience will see performances from finalists Angelica Hale, Light Balance and Preacher Lawson.
