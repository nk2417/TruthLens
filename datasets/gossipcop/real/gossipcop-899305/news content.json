It\u2019s certainly not a crime and when coming from a professional comedian it\u2019s actually quite funny. Unfortunately for Hannibal, the arresting officers didn\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nX content\n\nFollowing the arrest, footage of the incident surfaced online. Buress was shown handcuffed, yelling at an officer and refusing to get into a police car. \u201cWhat am I being detained for,\u201d he asked two police officers. One officer said \u201ctrespassing\u201d but later was heard saying \u201cdisorderly intoxication.\u201d Buress responded, \u201cNo, I'm not getting in your car unless you have probable cause for anything. ... Take the handcuffs off of me, I didn\u2019t do anything, I\u2019m not getting in your car.\u201d", "images": ["https://pitchfork.com/verso/static/pitchfork-us/assets/logo-inverted.svg", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a739a81b055824abae8b2ef/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-683092458.jpg", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a739a81b055824abae8b2ef/2:1/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-683092458.jpg", "https://pitchfork.com/verso/static/pitchfork-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://pitchfork.com/verso/static/pitchfork-us/assets/logo-header.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a739a81b055824abae8b2ef/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-683092458.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amanda Wicks", "Evan Minsker"], "canonical_link": "https://pitchfork.com/news/hannibal-buress-charges-dropped-after-miami-arrest/", "title": "Hannibal Buress Charges Dropped After Miami Arrest", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Amanda Wicks", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "\u201cDismissed.\u201d", "id": "5a2de30685030943c5158843", "keywords": "legal", "news_keywords": "legal", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a2de30685030943c5158843", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"\u201cDismissed.\u201d\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a739a81b055824abae8b2ef/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-683092458.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a739a81b055824abae8b2ef/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-683092458.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\u201cDismissed.\u201d", "image": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a739a81b055824abae8b2ef/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-683092458.jpg", "site_name": "Pitchfork", "title": "Hannibal Buress Charges Dropped After Miami Arrest", "type": "article", "url": "https://pitchfork.com/news/hannibal-buress-charges-dropped-after-miami-arrest/"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-02-01T23:03:08.498Z", "modified_time": "2018-02-01T23:03:08.498Z", "author": "Amanda Wicks,Evan Minsker"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@pitchfork", "description": "\u201cDismissed.\u201d", "domain": "https://pitchfork.com", "image": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a739a81b055824abae8b2ef/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-683092458.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@pitchfork", "title": "Hannibal Buress Charges Dropped After Miami Arrest"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a739a81b055824abae8b2ef/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/GettyImages-683092458.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 207089362687909, "pages": 28015075999}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517526188.498, "source": "https://pitchfork.com", "summary": ""}
