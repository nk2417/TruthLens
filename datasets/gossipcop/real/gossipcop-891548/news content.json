Paulk and Ray J.\n\n\"This is just such a great moment,\" she explained. \"This is beautiful. This is God. This is love. This is everything. Thank you guys so much for this moment.\"\n\nMoesha aired from 1996 to 2001 and followed Brandy's character as she navigated family and teenage life in Los Angeles. Nearly two decades later, the cast couldn't be more on board for a possible reboot.\n\n\"We ended on a cliff,\" Brandy reasoned. \"[Moesha's brother] Miles was kidnapped, [and] we don't know who's pregnant.\"\n\nET spoke with Brandy last year, and she opened up about Moesha's legacy and the possibility of continuing the story on screen.\n\n\u201cI was very, very disappointed with how the show ended,\u201d Brandy said, revealing she still gets questions from fans about the fate of the show\u2019s characters. \u201cI would really love to resolve that issue.\u201d\n\n\u201c[A Netflix reboot] would be awesome,\u201d she added, noting that Full House came back with Fuller House. \u201cWe could do, like, two episodes or something. I'm ready to go!\u201d\n\nHear more from Brandy in the video below.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2016-02/1280_ET_EXCLUSIVE_Moesha_020216.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-08/1280_brandy_norwood_081617_getty832615886.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/rs_1024x682-171103143216-1024-moesha-cast-reunionthe-real-2-110317.jpg?h=69f2b9d0", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/rs_1024x682-171103143216-1024-moesha-cast-reunionthe-real-2-110317.jpg?h=69f2b9d0&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2024-06/mk-WILLIAM-DANIELS%2C%20WILL-FRIEDLE-1920-x-800-GALLERY-HERO.jpg?h=2dd012a0&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/rs_1024x682-171103143216-1024-moesha-cast-reunionthe-real-2-110317.jpg?h=69f2b9d0", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/brandy-tears-reuniting-moesha-cast-16-years-later-talks-possible-reboot-90450", "title": "Brandy Tears Up Reuniting With 'Moesha' Cast 16 Years Later, Talks Possible Reboot", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/rs_1024x682-171103143216-1024-moesha-cast-reunionthe-real-2-110317.jpg?h=69f2b9d0", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 38-year-old actress wasn't the only 'Moesha' cast member struggling to hold back her emotions.", "title": "Brandy Tears Up Reuniting With 'Moesha' Cast 16 Years Later, Talks Possible Reboot", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/brandy-tears-reuniting-moesha-cast-16-years-later-talks-possible-reboot-90450", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 38-year-old actress wasn't the only 'Moesha' cast member struggling to hold back her emotions.", "twitter": {"description": "The 38-year-old actress wasn't the only 'Moesha' cast member struggling to hold back her emotions.", "title": "Brandy Tears Up Reuniting With 'Moesha' Cast 16 Years Later, Talks Possible Reboot", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/brandy-tears-reuniting-moesha-cast-16-years-later-talks-possible-reboot-90450", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-11/rs_1024x682-171103143216-1024-moesha-cast-reunionthe-real-2-110317.jpg?h=69f2b9d0", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Brandy Tears Up Reuniting With 'Moesha' Cast 16 Years Later, Talks Possible Reboot | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, Brandy, Ray J", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
