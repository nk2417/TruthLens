If there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s a total turn off at parties, that\u2019s dry lips. The winter air blows against your lips and leaves them dry and strips them of their moisture. The lips lose their natural pink color as a result, and for those with naturally dry lips, the lips get discolored and pale and are even known to flake and bleed. The top layer of the lips is most sensitive and as a result, this is the layer that needs to be taken care of the most.\n\nFor this reason, the one thing you need to carry with you everywhere is a good lip balm. We bring to you the best lip balm for dry lips that are available in the Indian market, and why you must use them. The price has also been quoted so you can choose the one that has the least pocket pinch.\n\nTop Five: Best Lip Balm For Dry Lips\n\n1.
