Thanks to social media, the annual event has become a #Blackmoment, where everywhere comes dressed in their Sunday best. And whether you\u2019re there or not, you\u2019ll spend a lot of time just scramming through the gram, getting your life from these looks. And honestly, the flicks are amazing. There\u2019s a bit of church, a dash of brunch, and a whole lot of Black excellence. Hands down, it\u2019s the best place to catch some dope fashion looks while sitting out on the lawn, sipping on your champagne. And I love any event that turns into a Black family reunion! If you need some fashion inspo for the summer, just look at these fire fits spotted this weekend at the Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic sponsored by Hublot.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bjih2KJg1-KjNmZLmKLcfiQetNBeieZ4HXLXHQ0/ This stylista gave us a case for all pink this summer in this fabulous pantsuit, paired with sneakers to keep it calm and casual-yet-glam on the lawn. Oh, and these cheetah sunglasses? Fierce!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BjinwvKBf12/?tagged=vcpoloclassic This stylista gave us floral-themed goodness for the day, pairing a beautiful purple floral dress with some pink flowers.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BjlAihhAmbP/?tagged=vcpoloclassic This fashion-savvy duo popped out in frills and a two-piece set (which is also by the poppin\u2019 Black designer, Fenoel.) Which is your favorite look? I can\u2019t choose!\n\nI LOVE PINK. This hot pink number has a low plunging neckline and a thigh slit, perfect for a summer night out with your friends or even date night with your boo. This dress is a lewwwwk.\n\nThis green pantsuit looked so chic and dapper on this fashionisto, who gave us color for the summer and spring. I never thought I\u2019d like a green pantsuit as much as this, but I am diggin\u2019 this vibe.\n\nOh, and don\u2019t get it twisted: Celebs come out to the function as well! The beautiful Winnie Harlow was spotted in New York, sporting off those long legs in this dope fit. Winnie never disappoints!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BjlCwuCH0FK/ This boss babe wore this beautiful pastel, off-the-shoulder flowy dress, decked out with some nude heels and a matching nude purse.\n\nI\u2019m such a fan of off-the-shoulder and bardot tops, so this pristine white knotted front top just gave me all the life. Such a simple piece paired with jeans, but it\u2019s totally classy and high-end to me. Slay girl!\n\nThis stylista not only rocked her beautiful afro while out, but also this off-the-shoulder jumper with these white mules. How fabulous! I love me a good romper.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BjlMAJgHb_h/ Even the men came out in their full fits for the polo event! This all-white fit is absolutely dapper, and paired with an orange linen blazer? Yes, Black king. YAAASS.\n\nEven the kids came to slay! Farouk James came in this dapper polo fit, and with all that flowy hair? This is a model pose. Put it on a cover!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BjlFsNMhc6W/?tagged=vcpoloclassic This yellow silk dress just screams summer, and this fashionista gave us face and body! To finish out with this statement-making dress, she matched it with some nude, open-toed sandals. Chic!\n\nThis frilly, see-through, poppin\u2019 dress is a vibe. I\u2026just can\u2019t deal. These cuts? These angles? Can we just take a second to appreciate and enjoy this look? Girl, let\u2019s talk about where I can get this fit.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BjlIAJgBaY_/?tagged=vcpoloclassic This baby blue, off-the-shoulder number with these frills are all things fashion. It\u2019s such an intricate piece, but yet so simple. Queen, how do you slay like this? Nevertheless, I\u2019m here for it.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BjkRqu3FlOX/?tagged=vcpoloclassic Grace Bol was also at the function, having fun for the day in this chic white Tory Burch minidress. How stylish is this fit?!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BjjGh2hHZt-/ These men look so chic in their fits. This all-white LV-esque fit is fire, but also this two-piece set is giving me everything for that beautiful, green lawn. Also everyone had one of these fab yellow umbrellas, and now I\u2019m wondering where I can get one.\n\nThis black bardot top and black-and-white stripped pant set was so fab and unexpected! We normally expect dresses and suits for this event, so it was a breath of fresh air to see a nuanced fashion look riddled with style!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BjkPzfAFY3o/?tagged=vcpoloclassic This look is honestly something so unexpected to me, and that\u2019s why I love it! Who says you can\u2019t pair metallics with non-metallics, or that something with a bit of gold can\u2019t go with silver? Fashion is whatever you want it to be, shine girl!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BjkJmDIHmoX/?tagged=vcpoloclassic How mesmerizing is this African-print sundress? Not only is it a super simple fit that can easily be dressed up and down, but it\u2019s just\u2026such an understated statement-maker. This Queen brought it home!\n\nShe just makes me want to stay moisturized, fit, and fabulous with bundles!This floral two-piece set with a bandot top and a long maxi skirt was just everything with its color palette. It just looks like an art painting on Black skin.\n\nI promise, no more pink suits, but I told y\u2019all it\u2019s a vibe! This longline linen pantsuit is a look that you can wear with the blazer, or you can pair the blazer with some nude heels and wear it as a dress (or maybe some pants underneath.) Love everything about the pink suits coming out to play!\n\nLast but certainly not least, this curvy stylista gave the gram BODY in this super cute yellow two-piece frilly set. Just goes to show that you can rock whatever you want, because nobody can tell me she doesn\u2019t look bomb!", "images":
