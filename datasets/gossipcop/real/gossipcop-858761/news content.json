Unlike many Hollywood figures, the \u201cMad Men\u201d alum does not have a social media presence \u2014 and he intends to keep it that way.\n\n\u201cThe point of life is not to put dog ears on yourself and post it online for everyone to see,\u201d Hamm said, referencing Snapchat\u2019s popular filters. \u201cIt\u2019s fun, it\u2019s adorable, but it\u2019s the visual equivalent of masturbating \u2014 there\u2019s no point other than immediate gratification.\u201d\n\nThe 46-year-old actor, who split in 2015 from Jennifer Westfeldt, his partner of 18 years, also said during the interview that he does not particularly enjoy being single.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be single after being together for a long time,\u201d he said. It\u2019s really hard. It sucks.\u201d\n\nHamm, who appears in this summer\u2019s \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d said he would rather be part of a beloved project that touches the zeitgeist like \u201cMad Men\u201d than become the world\u2019s biggest A-lister.\n\n\u201cWe all want to be involved in something that takes hold of the culture and makes people sit up and say, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s interesting,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cActually, that\u2019s all I ever wanted. I never wanted to be a Tom Cruise type of megastar.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/5x4_082025_COVER_B.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Jon-Hamm.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Jon-Hamm.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Gajewski", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid", "Border-Radius Box-Shadow Rgba", "Rgba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/jon-hamm-social-media-masturbating/", "title": "Jon Hamm Says Social Media Is \u2018the Visual Equivalent of Masturbating\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jon Hamm Says Social Media Is 'the Visual Equivalent of Masturbating'", "description": "\"There's no point other than immediate gratification,\" the \"Mad Men\" star told InStyle about posting selfies", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/jon-hamm-social-media-masturbating/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Jon-Hamm.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-02T20:49:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-02T21:20:04+00:00"}, "author": "Ryan Gajewski", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Ryan Gajewski", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "baby-driver, jon_hamm, mad_men", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496436563.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
