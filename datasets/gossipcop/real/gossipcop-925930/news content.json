News of the couple\u2019s separation emerged in 2012, and their divorce is nearly finalized.\n\n\u201cIn case anyone is interested \u2026 $3.7m at the coal face and around $350k of conversations ongoing \u2026 and a bunch of stuff I didn\u2019t really want to sell coming home \u2026 not a bad hourly rate for a 5 hour shift . Hope you are happy and busy,\u201d Crowe tweeted Saturday.\n\nCrowe told Good Morning Britain on Friday that the jock strap surprisingly turned out to be \u201cone of the most popular items\u201d leading up to the event.\n\n\u201cIt was my jock strap when I won the heavyweight championship of the world as the character James J. Braddock in the film Cinderella Man,\u201d he said. \u201cI put it in the collection as a piece of whimsy and a bit of a gag. Funny enough, it\u2019s garnered a lot of attention.\u201d\n\nAmong the high-ticket items was the death armor worn by Crowe for his Oscar-winning performance in Gladiator, which was sold for $125,000. Other pieces from the Ridley Scott-directed movie also earned big bucks, including an aluminum prop sword and spare blade combo ($70,000), a Roman chariot replica ($65,000), a pair of black leather wrist cuffs ($32,000), a wooden training sword ($20,0000), and two life-size prop horses ($5,500 each).\n\nBEN RUSHTON/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock\n\nBEN RUSHTON/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock\n\nCostumes pieces from 2003\u2019s Master and Commander ($115,000), 2012\u2019s Les Mis\u00e9rables ($16,000 and $12,000), and 2010\u2019s Robin Hood ($12,000 and $11,000) also attracted buyers.\n\nCharles Blackman\u2019s 1960 painting \u201cThe Suitor\u201d earned $360,000, which appeared to be Crowe\u2019s biggest ticket item.\n\nCrowe said the most sentimental item was an 1890 Leandro Bisiach violin Crowe used in Master and Commander. Pre-auction, it was estimated to be worth between $110,000 and $140,000. It ended up selling for $150,000.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

And it shouldn\u2019t\u2026 It should be played by somebody fabulous.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cHopefully what will happen with this is somebody will come along and purchase this instrument as an investment. And they\u2019ll lend it out to a musician and it will go on the next stage of its life, where it starts playing on the big concert halls of the world.\u201d\n\nThe star first tweeted about the sale back in February, sharing a shot of the print cover of the Sotheby\u2019s catalog that shows him dressed in a tuxedo, grinning while raising a celebratory toast to the camera.\n\nWhen asked by Good Morning Britain why he wanted to name the sale \u201cThe Art of Divorce,\u201d Crowe said he saw it as an opportunity to let go of the past.\n\n\u201cGetting to this point with the divorce, and no matter how amicable a split is, you\u2019ve still got to unwind things at a deep level,\u201d he explained.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been somebody who deconstructs things, I\u2019ve always been somebody who builds things. So it was quite a big lesson in life to become somebody who can deconstruct things,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I thought to myself, \u2018While I\u2019m in the middle of doing that, how else can I do that? How else can I apply that?\u2019 And this is what I came up with.\u201d\n\nCrowe added that it took him 12 months to pull the collection together. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot of fun,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is almost like doing a full production \u2026 choosing the articles and how they balance with each other so there are collections within the collection. It\u2019s been joyful.\u201d\n\nLisa Maree Williams/Getty\n\nNews broke of Crowe and Spencer\u2019s split in October 2012, more than 20 years after the couple met playing lovers in the 1990 movie The Crossing.\n\nThe couple, who wed in April 2003, share two children: sons Charles, 13 and Tennyson, 11.\n\nCrowe\u2019s latest film, Boy Erased, is in post-production. He stars in the project \u2014 about the son of a Baptist preacher who is forced to participate in a church-supported gay conversion program \u2014 alongside fellow Aussie Nicole Kidman and Oscar nominee Lucas Hedges.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/-hZlhxVMUhZJY3IjOgScolLU0zg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/akon-111225-6fc0fd8bc2b44c2db9eff858abc08087.jpg",
