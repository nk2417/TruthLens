With a little Disney magic.\n\nAfter news dropped that Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson are set to marry after just several weeks of dating, the happy couple celebrated with a trip to Disneyland on Monday. The 24-year-old singer, who was also accompanied by brother Frankie Grande, documented their adventure on her Instagram story, sharing videos of her fianc\u00e9, also 24, making silly remarks mid-ride as she giggled.\n\nShe captioned one video, \u201cFull mood,\u201d while another was labeled, \u201cAnother take. I really like this one.\u201d\n\nMEGA\n\nGrande got a little naughty in another post, which featured Davidson yelling with the caption, \u201cWhen I got on top.\u201d She later deleted the joke, but the clip was captured and shared to Twitter by fans.\n\nThe Disneyland Celebrities Instagram page also obtained a video captured by a fan of the duo getting off of a rollercoaster, with Davidson thoughtfully offering his hand to help the pop star out.\n\nGrande rocked mouse ears for the outing and briefly waved after a fan called out her name.\n\nAnother admirer was lucky enough to snap a few selfies with the \u201cNo Tears Left to Cry\u201d singer.\n\nPEOPLE confirmed on Monday that Grande and Davidson are engaged after several weeks of dating.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Five Things To Know About Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande\n\nFor her part, the singer tweeted \u201ci love u sm hi & thank u i love u bye,\u201d a message that many of her followers are taking as her own confirmation of the news.\n\nGrande also wrote, \u201ccrying,\u201d in response to a tweet calling her \u201cMrs. Davidson.\u201d\n\nAnother told the star, \u201cI hope he knows he is maRRYING US AS WELL.\u201d Grande replied, \u201cHAHAHAHAHAHH HES BEEN BRIEFED.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a recent engagement. They\u2019re just two people who found love quickly and make each other happy all the time. They both started talking about it this past weekend. It\u2019s nothing they\u2019ve been hiding,\u201d an insider told PEOPLE.\n\nWatch the full season of SearchHistory on PeopleTV.com or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.\n\nThe couple \u2014 who began dating shortly after Grande\u2019s breakup from rapper ex Mac Miller in May \u2014 have been using social media to express their affection for one another. Davidson also confirmed that he had split from his longtime girlfriend Cazzie David in mid-May, around the same time he wrapped his fourth season performing on Saturday Night Live. He will reportedly return to the show when it resumes production in the fall.\n\n\u201cEveryone around them is super supportive and happy that they\u2019ve found love,\u201d a source told PEOPLE.\n\nAnd the newly engaged pair have also continued to support one another after they opened up about their respective hardships.\n\n\u201cHe went through a rough patch a while back but he\u2019s been really happy lately,\u201d the source said about Davidson, who recently revealed that he\u2019s back to drinking and smoking following his diagnosis of borderline personality disorder. Davidson has also said he struggles with anxiety and Crohn\u2019s disease.\n\nGrande previously said she\u2019s battled anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder since the bombing at the Manchester, U.K. concert venue where she was performing in May 2017.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about because so many people have suffered such severe, tremendous loss,\u201d she told Vogue U.K. for their July issue.\n\n\u201cBut, yeah, it\u2019s a real thing. I know those families and my fans, and everyone there experienced a tremendous amount of it as well. Time is the biggest thing. I feel like I shouldn\u2019t even be talking about my own experience \u2014 like I shouldn\u2019t even say anything,\u201d Grande said.", "images":
