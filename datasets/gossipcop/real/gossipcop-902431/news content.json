The win joined earlier trophies for Best Actress Nicole Kidman, Best Supporting Actress Laura Dern and Best Supporting Actor Alexander Skarsgard. The hardware haul tonight follows eight Emmy Awards back in September and comes amid the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements, making the series seem even more relevant.\n\nTime\u2019s Up, a group of 300 women in the entertainment industry that recently started a legal defense fund for sexual harassment claims, was cited out by Big Little Lies star and exec producer Reese Witherspoon upon accepting the Limited Series Globe. \u201cThis show is so much about the life we present to the world that could be very different than the life we live behind closed doors,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I want to thank everyone who broke their silence this year and spoke up about abuse and harassment. You are so brave. And hopefully shows like this, more will be made so people out there who are feeling silenced by harassment, discrimination, abuse: Time is up. We see you, we hear you and we will tell your stories.\u201d\n\nBased on Liane Moriarty\u2019s novel, the David E Kelley-scripted, Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e-directed Big Little Lies tells the story of a group of women in a tight-knit, well-heeled community in Monterey, CA. When a murder rocks the gossipy residents, the fragile truths behind their picture-perfect lives threaten to be exposed.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nKelley said tonight, \u201cThis one\u2019s been a real joy. It started with Liane\u2019s great book, HBO\u2019s unflinching support\u201d and Vall\u00e9e. \u201cHe took this material into his heart and more importantly he delivered it from his heart elevating every page, every performance,\u201d Kelley added, noting, \u201cAs for the cast, take a look at this cast, many of which have already been honored but two of which are also ferocious producers, Nicole and Reese.\u201d\n\nThe series is getting a second installment with a seven-episode order coming through in early December. Back for the follow-up are Kidman and Witherspoon as well Kelley who again is penning all of the scripts partially based on a story by Moriarty. Andrea Arnold is directing.\n\nWhen the greenlight was announced, Witherspoon said, \u201cIt gives us the opportunity to delve deeper into the lives of these intriguing and intricate Monterey families and bring more of their stories back to the audience who embraced and championed them.\u201d\n\nAdded Kidman, \u201cThis is inspired by the overwhelming response by audiences around the world, conceived once again by Liane Moriarty, realized by David Kelley and now in the hands of visionary filmmaker Andrea Arnold. What a journey this has been.\u201d\n\nBLL is made by HBO Entertainment, David E. Kelly Productions, Pacific Standard and Blossom Films.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rexfeatures_9307692hf.jpg?w=1024"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/rexfeatures_9307692hf.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nancy Tartaglione", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/01/big-little-lies-golden-globe-best-limited-series-hbo-1202237709/", "title": "\u2018Big Little Lies\u2019 Reese Witherspoon: \u201cTime Is Up, We Will Tell Your Stories\u201d \u2013 Golden Globes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "HBO's Big Little Lies capped off a Golden Globes sweep with the prize for Best Limited TV Series/Made for TV Movie tonight.
