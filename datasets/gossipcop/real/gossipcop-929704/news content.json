Television procedural. Crawford admitted that he was \u201creprimanded twice\u201d during the second season of the Fox procedural.\n\nHe said the first incident happened when he became angry with what he deemed unsafe working conditions on the set. After the outburst, Crawford said he met with human resources, apologized for his role in the conflict and completed studio-appointed therapy, while also sharing a \u201csizable portion\u201d of his paycheck with one of the parties involved \u2014 at Warners\u2018 request. The second incident occurred during an episode Crawford was directing when another actor on set felt unsafe after being hit by a piece of shrapnel from an effect.\n\n\u201cI absolutely love, respect and care for my crew and cast, and would never intentionally jeopardize so many jobs,\u201d Crawford wrote. \u201cI an incredibly sorry if my passion for doing good work has ever made anyone feel less than comfortable on our set, or feel less than celebrated for their efforts. Furthermore, I apologize to all the crew and cast for any negative attention Lethal Weapon is receiving because of these incidents.\u201d\n\nCrawford\u2019s behavior has left Lethal Weapon \u2014 one of Fox\u2019s better-performing dramas \u2014 on the bubble as many connected with the series have said they would rather not work with the actor. Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that producer Warner Bros. Television is considering recasting Crawford\u2019s leading role \u2014 potentially with an actress \u2014 as the independent studio hopes to score a third-season renewal. Fox and Warner Bros. Television have until June 30 \u2014 when options on the cast expire \u2014 to make a decision on the future of the series.\n\nLoosely inspired by the film franchise starring Mel Gibson and Danny Glover, Fox\u2019s Lethal Weapon follows Riggs (Crawford), coming back to work after the loss of his wife and unborn child, and Murtaugh (Damon Wayans), recovering from a heart attack, as they partner up to work the beat in modern-day Los Angeles. Matt Miller serves as showrunner on the drama, which is exec produced by McG, Dan Lin and Jennifer Gwartz.\n\nRead Crawford\u2019s full post, below.\n\nForgive my delayed response. #truth A post shared by Clayne Crawford (@claynecrawford) on Apr 24, 2018 at 12:53pm PDT\n\nKeep track of all the latest renewals and cancellations with THR\u2018s scorecard and of all the pilot pickups with our handy guide.
