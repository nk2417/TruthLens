Because Chris Klein has finally addressed that leaked 'Mamma Mia' audition video. And this is what he had to say:\n\nThe Huffington Post's Mike Ryan sat down with the actor to discuss 'American Reunion' and the trajectory of Klein's career. When asked about the leaked audition tape, Klein took it in stride:\n\n\"I took a chance -- I can't sing! I don't know why I was in there. But I took a chance! It's a musical -- let's see if I can give it a shot. And, you know, the way that they put it out there, it gets taken out of context and all that kind of thing. It was really a dreadful audition.\"\n\nHe goes on to discuss his Funny or Die video (below, following the original leaked tape) in which he makes fun of the tape by showing other leaked, failed \"auditions,\" including a hilarious reading for 'Twilight' and his delightful rendition of the 'MacGruber' theme song.\n\nAnd yet, no mention of his work in 'Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li.\" What a missed opportunity to discuss such an oft-overlooked American treasure.", "images": ["http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2012/04/box-office-hunger-games-still-on-top.png?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2012/04/american-reunion-sexist.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2012/03/american-reunion.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2014/07/coul111.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2012/04/ferris-cast1.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2012/03/156145_trailer-american-reunion.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2012/04/tara-reid.jpg?w=980&q=75", "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2012/03/Chris-Klein.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2012/12/216_8_0_prm-wds8keyart_1024x640.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2012/03/Chris-Klein.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2012/04/american-reunion-rev.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2018/04/screencrush-high-rez.png"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2012/03/Chris-Klein.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Britt Hayes"], "canonical_link": "https://screencrush.com/chris-klein-mamma-mia/", "title": "Chris Klein Discusses That Leaked \u2018Mamma Mia\u2019 Audition Video", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "screencrush", "keywords": "movie news", "fb": {"app_id": 856098531951831, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "false", "admins": 100002025987268, "pages": 335338213173624}, "og": {"title": "Chris Klein Discusses That Leaked 'Mamma Mia' Audition Video", "url": "https://screencrush.com/chris-klein-mamma-mia/", "site_name": "ScreenCrush", "type": "article", "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2012/03/Chris-Klein.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@screencrushnews"}, "sailthru.date": "2012-03-28 16:14:26", "sailthru.title": "Chris Klein Discusses That Leaked \u2018Mamma Mia\u2019 Audition Video", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-screencrush, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, american-reunion, movie-news", "sailthru.author": "britthayes", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2012/03/Chris-Klein.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2012/03/Chris-Klein.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "ad": {"primis": {"id": 113734}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1332965666.0, "source": "http://screencrush.com", "summary": ""}
