The out screenwriter for shows like Master of None and The Chi showed up to the yearly event wearing a simple suit, along with a long, flowing rainbow flag cape. A direct political statement about the Catholic Church\u2019s stance on homosexuality, along with an homage to the \u201csuperhero\u201d metaphor the actress used in her Emmy acceptance speech earlier this year, the cape made a big splash on the red carpet.\n\nUnderstandably, Waithe\u2019s outfit dominated the conversation on Gay Twitter\u2122 Monday night (May 7). Here are a few of Billboard Pride\u2019s favorite reactions to Lena Waithe\u2019s red carpet look for the 2018 Met Gala:\n\nlena waithe: actually god is gay\n\nmet gala: elaborate on that\n\nlena waithe: no pic.twitter.com/5LWCbOpsvG \u2014 hawaiian shirt wan (@lgbtkenobi) May 7, 2018\n\n#metgala: the theme is religion\n\nLena Waithe: ok hold my rainbow flag pic.twitter.com/6nkPKlsUsK \u2014 Call Me By My @ (@NotAgainBen) May 7, 2018\n\nRihanna killed me and then Lena Waithe\u2019s cape revived me and killed me again #metgala2018 pic.twitter.com/yWJYzkaAOw \u2014 Maeve McDermott (@maeve_mcdermott) May 7, 2018\n\nEvery homophobic catholic has been found dead Lena Waithe did not come to play tonight #MetGala pic.twitter.com/HqzGOd4LDE \u2014 p (@bIondhampton) May 7, 2018\n\nLena Waithe as queer priestess.
