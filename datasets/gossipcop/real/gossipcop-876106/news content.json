I'm just thinking about the fight.\"\n\nLovato is a longtime boxing fan, and said her favorite workout is actually jiu-jitsu.\n\n\u201cI've been a white belt for over a year now and so it's time [to get a blue belt],\" she shared. \"But I can't, you can't ask for it\u2026 It goes white, blue, purple, brown, black. So I'll have a blue belt probably by the end of the year. But we'll see what happens.\u201d\n\nWatch below:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/gettyimages-833805558.jpg?h=84071268", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/gettyimages-833805558.jpg?h=84071268&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-03/1280_demi_lovato_GettyImages-652227210.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-08/set_demi_lovato_082117_instagram.jpg?h=de019685&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/gettyimages-833805558.jpg?h=84071268", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/demi-lovato-sing-national-anthem-floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor-fight-85852", "title": "Demi Lovato to Sing the National Anthem at Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor Fight", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/gettyimages-833805558.jpg?h=84071268", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "To say Demi Lovato is excited for the fight of the year is an understatement.", "title": "Demi Lovato to Sing the National Anthem at Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor Fight", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/demi-lovato-sing-national-anthem-floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor-fight-85852", "type": "Article"}, "description": "To say Demi Lovato is excited for the fight of the year is an understatement.", "twitter": {"description": "To say Demi Lovato is excited for the fight of the year is an understatement.", "title": "Demi Lovato to Sing the National Anthem at Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor Fight", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/demi-lovato-sing-national-anthem-floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor-fight-85852", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/gettyimages-833805558.jpg?h=84071268", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Demi Lovato to Sing the National Anthem at Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor Fight | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Demi Lovato, Conor McGregor, Floyd Mayweather", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
