Though, it wasn\u2019t always that way. First attending the event back in 2007, Rihanna was always well-dressed, but it took a few more go-arounds on the famed museum steps for her emerge as a master of Met Gala dressing.\n\nHer past Met Gala looks vary from a tailored suit in 2009 to a revealing Stella McCartney white two-piece gown in 2014. On the 2015 red carpet, Rihanna was undeniably one of the best dressed in attendance, wearing a yellow Guo Pei gown with an insanely elaborate train and a matching headpiece that made headlines as one of the most memorable Met Gala looks of all time. In 2017, she stole the show again in Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and has since walked the steps in everything from Valentino to Balenciaga. Here, a look back at all of Rihanna\u2019s jaw-dropping Met Gala looks, from 2007 until now.\n\n2007: Poiret: King of Fashion Getty Images At 2007\u2019s Met Gala, \u201cPoiret: King of Fashion,\u201d Rihanna wore a white Georges Chakra gown with silver embellishments and mesh gloves. She carried a red rose as an additional accessory.\n\nGetty Images 2007 was Rihanna\u2019s first Met Gala and, clearly, the best was yet to come.\n\n2009: The Model as Muse Getty Images Rihanna chose a Dolce & Gabbana suit and bow tie paired with black stilettos for 2009\u2019s \u201cThe Model as Muse\u201d Met Gala.\n\nGetty Images The theme was all about the people that wear the clothes, rather than a central clothing theme itself. Still, Rihanna made a statement with this menswear-inspired look.\n\n2011: Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty Getty Images Wearing a black lace Stella McCartney gown at the 2011 Met Gala, \u201cAlexander McQueen: Savage Beauty,\u201d Rihanna accessorized with a long side-braid and emerald earrings.\n\nGetty Images It was another year where the exhibition theme was about a specific designer, which can be hard to channel when you\u2019re paired with another fashion house.\n\n2012: Schiaparelli And Prada: Impossible Conversations Getty Images Rihanna wore a black Tom Ford gown in a crocodile texture to the 2012 ball. The theme was \u201cSchiaparelli And Prada: Impossible Conversations.\u201d\n\nGetty Images She paired the look with a chic updo, accentuating the fact the side of her head was shaved at the time.\n\n2014: Charles James: Beyond Fashion Getty Images Rihanna wore a white Stella McCartney two-piece for the 2014 edition, \u201cCharles James: Beyond Fashion.\u201d\n\nGetty Images Clearly, she was ahead of the game when it came to wearing formal crop tops.\n\n2015: China Through The Look Glass Getty Images 2015 was the year Rihanna began to really earn her reputation as the queen of dressing on theme. The exhibition that year was entitled \u201cChina Through The Looking Glass,\u201d and Rihanna wore a yellow gown by Chinese designer Guo Pei who said that \u201conly women who have the confidence of a queen could wear it.\u201d\n\nGetty Images She accented the look with a headpiece fit for a queen.\n\n2017: Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art Of The In-Between Getty Images The \u201cavant-garde\u201d mandate of the 2017 red carpet for the \u201cRei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art Of The In-Between\u201d exhibition tripped up many, but Rihanna knew what to do. She was one of the few to actually wear Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, and arguably the one to pull it off best.\n\nGetty Images The flower-inspired look may have eaten others up, but Rihanna remained the prettiest blossom in the bunch.\n\n2019: Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination Getty Images The theme in 2018 was \u201cHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,\u201d so what did Rihanna do?
