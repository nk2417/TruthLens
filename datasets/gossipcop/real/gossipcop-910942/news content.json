I mean, they didn't talk about [their relationship] the entire time, until just recently,\" Amick told ET's Leanne Aguilera at the Television Critics Association press tour in Beverly Hills, California. \"So, it's nice that they're able to now, like, be public with it, so it's not so under wraps.\"\n\n\"But at the same time, they're in complete control of what they want to share and how they want to share it,\" she added. \"Behind the scenes, they're so sweet with each other and they're both just exceptional people.\"\n\nThe CW\n\nUlrich chimed in, saying he's \"really glad\" Reinhart and Sprouse found each other, just like their characters, Betty and Jughead, did on the show.\n\n\"It's a lot of work; it's a long season,\" he says of filming The CW series. \"It's nice. They really keep each other grounded and supported. Their friendship is beautiful.\"\n\nPhillip Faraone/Getty Images for WIRED\n\nET previously reported that Riverdale will return for a third season on Oct. 10. Amick teased that fans can expect \"an epidemic,\" with Ulrich adding that it will be \"of pure evil.\"\n\n\"It's even darker than the previous two seasons,\" he revealed. \"There's already so many twists.\"\n\nThe interviews come just two days after Reinhart, 21, posted a sweet message to Sprouse on his 26th birthday. \"It seems as if the world would still be a stranger to me, if not for you,\" she captioned the Instagram pic. \"I'm so thankful that our paths intertwined to form this beautiful adventure~ Happy birthday, my love.\"\n\nEarlier on Monday, ET exclusively revealed stunning pics from the cast's emmy magazine feature, as well as a deleted scene from Riverdale's sophomore season.\n\nWatch below:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-08/riverdaledeletedscene_1280_0.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-08/gettyimages-955740330.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-06/shipworthy_gallery.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-08/z_emmymag_riverdale_2018-8830.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-05/lili_reinhart_cole_sprouse_gettyimages-955742914.jpg?h=4b6b20f9&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-08/gettyimages-955740330.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/riverdale-stars-gush-over-lili-reinhart-and-cole-sprouses-real-life-romance-exclusive-107409", "title": "'Riverdale' Stars Gush Over Lili Reinhart and Cole Sprouse's Real-Life Romance (Exclusive)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-08/gettyimages-955740330.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "ET caught up with the lovebirds' onscreen parents, M\u00e4dchen Amick and Skeet Ulrich, at the TCA press tour on Monday.", "title": "'Riverdale' Stars Gush Over Lili Reinhart & Cole Sprouse's Romance", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/riverdale-stars-gush-over-lili-reinhart-and-cole-sprouses-real-life-romance-exclusive-107409", "type": "Article"}, "description": "ET caught up with the lovebirds' onscreen parents, M\u00e4dchen Amick and Skeet Ulrich, at the TCA press tour on Monday.", "twitter": {"description": "ET caught up with the lovebirds' onscreen parents, M\u00e4dchen Amick and Skeet Ulrich, at the TCA press tour on Monday.", "title": "'Riverdale' Stars Gush Over Lili Reinhart & Cole Sprouse's Romance", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/riverdale-stars-gush-over-lili-reinhart-and-cole-sprouses-real-life-romance-exclusive-107409", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-08/gettyimages-955740330.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "'Riverdale' Stars Gush Over Lili Reinhart and Cole Sprouse's Real-Life Romance (Exclusive) | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, TV, Riverdale, Lili Reinhart, Cole Sprouse, Skeet Ulrich", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
