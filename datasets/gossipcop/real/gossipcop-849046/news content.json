Airing live from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on May 7 at 8:00 p.m., the newly minted show is sure to have plenty of surprises with DeVine at the helm.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already getting good vibes,\u201d he previously told PEOPLE while preparing for the show. \u201cI feel like they\u2019re probably going to invite me back every year.\u201d\n\nAs both a movie and television actor, the hilarious comic, 33, seems like a perfect fit for the revamped ceremony.\n\n\u201cI feel like I am the biggest movie and television star together as one,\u201d he said of being chosen to host. \u201cWill Smith might have something to say about that but they didn\u2019t ask him [to host], they asked me. So who\u2019s the bigger star? It\u2019s him, but I\u2019m doing the best with what I have.\u201d\n\nFrom Coinage: See Where 6 Stars Were Before They Were Famous\n\nWhile on his tour bus for his stand-up comedy shows, DeVine shares he got the call asking him to be host.\n\n\u201cI was a little hungover and I was in the back of the bus and they\u2019re like, \u2018We got big news!\u2019 And they told me and I literally went \u2014 gasp!\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like, \u2018Oh no, did he just die?\u2019 But I didn\u2019t die \u2014 I started living. Finally. With that news I could finally live.\u201d\n\nThe pressure is on for DeVine to top last year\u2019s co-hosts Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson, but he says that he\u2019s up for the challenge. \u201cI\u2019m going to be more muscular than them and have more vascularity,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way.\u201d\n\nAs for his favorite nominees, DeVine is rooting for his home teams. \u201cI believe Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates and Ice Age: Collision Course are going to take every award,\u201d he said of the two movies he had a starring role in.\n\nLast year\u2019s MTV Movie Awards saw some great moments from DeVine, including his on stage smooch with Pitch Perfect co-star Rebel Wilson after the two won the award for \u201cBest Kiss.\u201d\n\nFrazer Harrison/Getty Images for MTV\n\nThis year, the duo will be exchanging advice instead, since Wilson hosted the awards in 2013.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s probably going to tell me to do a big song and dance number and I might listen,\u201d he said. \u201cI also might have to ask big Conan O\u2019Brien [who hosted in 2014] with that curly mop top that he\u2019s got and ask him what I should do. Hopefully he doesn\u2019t say, \u2018Just be 6\u20194\u2033 and have red hair\u2019 because I won\u2019t be able to pull that off.\u201d\n\nDeVine won\u2019t be involved in the upcoming Pitch Perfect 3 with Wilson, but he still gave an idea about what his character, Bumper, has been up to since Pitch Perfect 2. \u201c[He\u2019s] probably lusting after Fat Amy somewhere just pining for her,\u201d he imagined. \u201cHe\u2019s probably homeless \u2014 that\u2019s probably it. Bumper fell on some hard times when Fat Amy kicked him to the curb.\u201d\n\nWhile the award categories are different this year, the iconic golden popcorn awards will remain the same. As a two-time winner, DeVine gave some advice on the best place to keep the statues.\n\n\u201cI keep them right in the spare bedroom,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople come and they spend the night, and they realize where they\u2019re at, the level of star that I am. I have two golden popcorns and a Teen Choice Award so I\u2019m peaking. This is it for me.\u201d\n\nWith some newfound free time since the Workaholics finale premiered, DeVine has plans to turn this hosting gig into a long-term career.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to host award shows for the foreseeable future \u2014 any award show,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to start big with the MTV Movie & TV Awards and then I\u2019m going to maybe host dog competitions. If not, then hopefully some other movies.\u201d\n\nThe MTV Movie & TV Awards will air live from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on May 7 at 8:00 p.m.", "images":
