He did not reveal the abuse to anyone until 12 years after it occurred.[11]\n\nShepard's mother had developed a substantial business by the time he was in high school.[5] She worked car shows with traveling events at racetracks. She started as a janitor on the midnight shift at GM,[12] then worked in fleet management at the GM proving grounds in Milford, Michigan, then hosted hospitality days for all the GM family members, eventually moving into public relations at an ad agency.[10] She returned to GM, becoming the owner of four shops that managed publicity events for magazine journalists. From 14 to 18, Shepard worked for his mother on the road, going from racetrack to racetrack.[4] For about two years, Shepard had a stepfather who was an engineer on the Corvette.[4][10] Shepard's mother has been married four times; Shepard said he has had three stepfathers.[13]\n\nAccording to Shepard, his mother named him for the rich playboy Dax (Diogenes Alejandro Xenos), in Harold Robbins' novel The Adventurers.[14] He has an older brother, David Shepard Jr., who lives in Oregon,[8] and a younger half-sister, Carly Hatter,[4] whom he cast in two films: 2012's Hit and Run[15][16] and 2017's CHiPs. Through marriage, he is distantly related to George Washington on his mother's side.[17]\n\nShepard has said that he was raised in Milford,[4] although he lived in many suburbs of Detroit, growing up primarily in Walled Lake, Michigan. Shepard is dyslexic and said it inspired his acting career.[18] He graduated from Walled Lake Central High School in 1993[19] before enrolling in The Groundlings school.[20]\n\nAfter attending Santa Monica College and West Los Angeles College, Shepard transferred to UCLA, where he graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in anthropology.[21] He had a deal with his mother that if he went to college she would pay his rent.[4]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nShepard at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City\n\nAfter a year in Santa Barbara, California, Shepard moved to Los Angeles in 1996.[4] He found out about The Groundlings improv troupe from a friend from Santa Barbara, Kareem Elseify, who ended up auditioning (the first time he acted) and took classes while attending UCLA.
