So, you wanna hear it? HERE IT IS:\n\nYeah, we're obsessed.\n\nHarry also spoke to Nick for two hours (TWO HOURS) about everything from what Adele gave him for his birthday to his 'weird' and 'wrong' approach to dating.\n\nOn the topic of his forthcoming album, Harry said he was nervous about the reaction it would receive, but also incredibly proud of it. He commented:\n\n\"It\u2019s a bit weird, I feel like I\u2019ve been hibernating for so long now and you hear it in the safety of the studio and now it\u2019s time to give birth \u2026 it\u2019s the song (debut single) I\u2019m most proud of writing.\n\n\"In the least weird way possible, it\u2019s my favourite album to listen to at the moment\u2026 I think if you put out something that you don\u2019t stand behind and really love\u2026then if it doesn\u2019t go well then you could regret not doing what you wanted to do. Whereas if nothing happens with it, I love it you know so I think that\u2019s what you should do.\"\n\nOn what inspired the album, Harry added:\n\n\u201cI think a lot of people, especially at labels separate it because they work in music that it\u2019s a broader understanding of music than people who are listening\u2026 I think we are all fans of music and I think we made it as the fan\u2026 I hope we did a good job but I really like the album so I hope people like it.\u201d\n\nYou go, Glen Coco.", "images":
