She paired the look with a white polo shirt and mirrored sunglasses.\n\nJenner publicly supported Trump, 71, throughout the 2016 presidential election season, much to the dismay of her fellow transgender advocates on her short-lived E! series, I Am Cait. She later told CNN that she did not regret casting her vote for Trump, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t support him in everything that he does, but we needed to shake the system up.\u201d\n\nRelated: Hillary Clinton\u2019s A-List Supporters They\u2019re with her! Hillary Clinton\u2019s A-list supporters \u2014 including Eva Longoria and Lena Dunham \u2014 explain why she\u2019s got their vote!\n\nThe Olympic gold medalist (formerly known as Bruce) reversed course in July after the real estate mogul announced on Twitter that transgender individuals will no longer be able to serve in the U.S. military \u201cin any capacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are 15,000 patriotic transgender Americans in the US military fighting for all of us,\u201d Jenner tweeted on July 26. \u201cWhat happened to your promise to fight for them?\u201d\n\nRelated: Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s Best Style Moments She's here\u2014and she's fabulous! With her July 2015 Vanity Fair cover, Caitlyn Jenner revealed herself to the world not only as a woman, but as one extremely stylish lady. From a Kate Middleton-esque wrap dress to a sequined miniskirt, click through to see Jenner's best style moments\u2014so far!\n\nThe Secrets of My Life author later released a full statement on her website. \u201cI believe every American should be outraged by the disrespect shown to those people wearing our country\u2019s uniform,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFurthermore, this half-baked idea puts all of our service members in harm\u2019s way. Does President Trump intend to just pull 15,000 people out of every critical position to which they are currently assigned? That would disrupt core military missions around the world and needlessly endanger our troops.\u201d\n\nJenner concluded her blog post: \u201cAmerica\u2019s 15,000 trans service members and 134,000 veterans are much braver than you, Mr. Trump; my allegiance is with them and our country, not you.\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us
