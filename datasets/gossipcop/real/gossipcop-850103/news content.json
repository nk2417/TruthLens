Big Bang and Young Sheldon are expected to provide a strong launch pad for CBS\u2019 Magnum P.I. reboot in the Monday 9 PM slot, followed by the relocated Bull at 10 PM. Airing the two returning comedies on the first Monday of the season also will allow for additional circulation and promotion for the new CBS half-hour series assigned to the Monday 8 PM hour, comedies The Neighborhood and Happy Together, which will debut Oct. 1.\n\nCBS will offer a double serving of Big Bang and Young Sheldon during premiere week as the comedies also will air originals in their regular Thursday 8 PM and 8:30 PM time periods, respectively, leading to the season premiere of Mom at 9 PM and the debut of the network\u2019s Murphy Brown revival at 9:30 PM.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nIt\u2019s mostly status quo for the rest of CBS\u2019 fall premiere strategy, with the season premiere of Survivor and the finale of Big Brother again taking over premiere Wednesday before the network\u2019s regular lineup, anchored by Survivor at 8 PM, debuts in Week 2.\n\nHere are the fall for new and returning CBS series, with new series in bold and new days and time slots noted:\n\nMonday, Sept. 24\n\n8-8:30 PM: THE BIG BANG THEORY (Season 12 Premiere)\n\n8:30-9 PM: YOUNG SHELDON (Season 2 Premiere)\n\n9-10 PM: MAGNUM P.I.
