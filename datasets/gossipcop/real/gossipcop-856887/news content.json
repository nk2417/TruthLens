Hilarious!\u201d Justin wrote alongside the image.\n\nProving himself a true Styles fan, he added: \u201cAlso congrats on the album, it sounds great!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Justin\u2019s fans have begged him to cancel his upcoming UK tour dates in the wake of the Manchester terror attack.\n\nThe Sorry singer is due to play a number of dates around the country over the summer, including a headline set at the British Summertime Festival in London\u2019s Hyde Park on July 2.\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict0003135787811.jpg?strip=all&w=640", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/newspress-collage-wi7zeasod-1763662341978.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1763662499&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jb2.png?strip=all&w=481", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JW_20_11_MANI_HEARTACHE_COMP.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TOB-Roses-v3_COMP-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jb-21.png?strip=all&w=461", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/crop-37387356.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/jb-11.png?strip=all&w=435", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/comp-biebsv2-sm.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C500px&resize=1920%2C1080", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/promo320004285.jpg?quality=90&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/comp-biebsv2-sm.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C750px%2C500px&resize=1920%2C1080", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3651845/justin-bieber-appears-drunk-as-he-forgets-the-words-to-his-hit-despacito-and-instead-sings-about-doritos/", "title": "Justin Bieber looks worse for wear as he forgets the words to his hit Despacito and instead sings about Doritos", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
