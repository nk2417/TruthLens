Octavia always changing. She's not a hero, she's not a villain \u2014 she's a wild card.\"\n\nAvgeropoulos says it's important to remember that Octavia's evolution into the Red Queen \"wasn't instantaneous. It was a slow burn that took place over six challenging, painful years.\"\n\n\"Towards the end of the season, there's one of my favorites episodes called 'The Dark Years' which gives Octavia some emotional redemption,\" she teases. \"I'm excited for fans to see what happened in those six years during the time jump. They'll find out more of who Bloodraina really is and how she became that way. It wasn't easy for her. She lost her innocence and a part of herself.\"\n\nHere's hoping that redemption arc also helps the Blake siblings find peace. Avgeropoulos correctly notes that \"Octavia and Bellamy have become incredibly different people. It also doesn't help that Octavia is starting to see him as an obstacle in her overall game plan \u2014 a potential enemy of Wonkru.\"\n\nSpeaking of Octavia's enemies, we can also look forward to her impending confrontation with Echo when the two formally reunite tonight (The CW, 9/8c). \"I'm pretty sure Echo \u2014 the woman who stabbed her and pushed her off a cliff \u2014 is the last person on Earth that Octavia would want to have as a sister-in-law,\" she says.\n\nYour thoughts on Octavia's new persona?
