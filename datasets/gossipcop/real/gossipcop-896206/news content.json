In honor of the anniversary this past weekend, some of the animated classic's stars reminisced on social media.\n\nScott Weinger, the voice of Aladdin, took to Twitter to melt our hearts with a message to Jasmine (Linda Larkin).\n\n\"Hey Princess @MissLindaLarkin can you believe #Aladdin was released 25 years ago today?\" he wrote. \"I'd lie to you about being a prince just to fly you around the world on a Magic Carpet all over again.\"\n\nYou might also recognize Scott from his role as DJ's love interest Steve on Full House and Fuller House.\n\nGetty Images\n\nA lot has changed in the past 25 years, but it's safe to say Scott's good looks have not.\n\nLinda reposted Scott's message on Instagram, adding \"@scottweinger ur [sic] a true prince even without the magic carpet backing you up! Love you so much!\"\n\nLea Salonga, who provided Jasmine's singing voice, also paid tribute on Twitter.\n\nOn a more heartbreaking note, Robin Williams's daughter Zelda tweeted a GIF from the animated movie on Nov. 25, exactly 25 years after its 1992 release date. The clip shows Genie, the character her late father voiced, playfully squeezing Aladdin's face.\n\n\"Genie turned 25 yesterday. Little brother turns 26 today. Life is full of reminders that time passes so very fast,\" she wrote. \"Now, excuse me while I go reenact this with my baby brother's face.\"\n\nWe've never had a friend like you, Genie!\n\n(h/t ABC
