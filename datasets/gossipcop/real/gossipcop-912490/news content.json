Although the character (spoiler alert) was found not guilty, he decided to leave his job as an ADA.\n\nIn a Tweet to the show\u2019s fans and his co-star Mariska Hargitay, Esparza wrote, \u201cGoodbye Barba. Thank you. You changed my life. My squad. And you, you always, my Liv, my friend Mariska. I will always treasure my time with all of you.\u201d\n\nBarba was a popular character on the long-running procedural where he was a by-the-book, no-nonsense attorney. In the role, Esparza, who is Cuban-American, also used his Spanish in some scenes. Many of his scenes were with Hargitay discussing the details of a case in his office and in court. Wednesday night, the hashtag barbaontrial was trending about the episode as fans and cast members were sad about the actor\u2019s departure from the show.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Esparza, who graduated from Belen Jesuit Prepatory School in Miami in 1988?\n\nAfter playing the same role on NBC, he\u2019s returning to his theatre roots for a \u201cChess\u201d revival at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C., according to Entertainment Weekly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a theater guy, so it\u2019s like having a script in front of you that keeps changing every time you go to do it,\u201d said Esparza, who has had roles in the 2000 \u201cThe Rocky Horror Show\u201d revival on Broadway as well as \u201cCabaret,\u201d \u201cTaboo,\u201d \u201cChitty Chitty Bang Bang\u201d and \u201cCompany.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe learning process of how roles grow over a period of time with a series has been kind of fascinating, and I just felt I had reached the end of what I wanted to explore where they were writing.\u201d\n\nEsparza\u2019s departure from \u201cLaw and Order: SVU\u201d followed that of another Miami native, Danny Pino, who played detective Nick Amaro from 2011 to 2015.\n\nThe Miami Coral Park Senior High graduate and Florida International University alumnus is joining the \u201cSons of Anarchy\u2019\u2019 spinoff called \u201cMayans MC\u201d on the FX network.\n\n.ss-blurb-fblike{\n\npadding-left:10px;\n\n}\n\n.ss-blurb-fblike-heading {\n\nfont-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;\n\nfont-weight: bold;\n\n}", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/02/08/K4C4TYOPLRCBBFIXCLN6AYQ5XM.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sunsent-removebg-preview.png"], "top_img": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/02/08/K4C4TYOPLRCBBFIXCLN6AYQ5XM.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Johnny Diaz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2018/02/08/miamis-raul-esparza-exits-nbcs-law-and-order-svu/", "title": "Miami\u2019s Raul Esparza exits NBC\u2019s \u2018Law and Order: SVU\u2019", "meta_data": {"application-name": "sunsentinel", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Johnny Diaz", "canonical": "https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2018/02/08/miamis-raul-esparza-exits-nbcs-law-and-order-svu/"}, "description": "Fans of the long running NBC \u201cLaw and Order: SVU\u201d said goodbye to district attorney Rafael Barba, played by Raul Esparza of Miami.
