In September Kim Kardashian West confirmed she and Kanye West are having their third child via surrogate. Three months later Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian revealed she is expecting her first baby ever with basketball-player boyfriend Tristan Thompson. However, Kylie Jenner is still keeping mum about rumors that she's also pregnant. Save for calling her new lip kits \"babies\" in a video a few months ago, Jenner is doing an excellent job at keeping people in the dark about this whole thing. Sure, her sisters may have come to her defense a few times when the speculation got out of hand, but Jenner's yet to confirm the actual news. We straight up don't know whether she's pregnant yet.\n\nAnd Khlo\u00e9's new interview with Ellen DeGeneres doesn't bring us any closer to the truth, either. The Good American entrepreneur sat down with DeGeneres this week to talk about her newly announced pregnancy, but before long the conversation pivoted to Kylie.\n\n\"Is Kylie craving things yet?\" DeGeneres asked Khlo\u00e9, to which she responded, \"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"She's pregnant,\" DeGeneres said. Khlo\u00e9, naturally, played coy at this. \"Oh, I don't know what you're taking about,\" she said.\n\nDeGeneres didn't back down, though. \"Come on now,\" she said, but Khlo\u00e9 bounced right back and said, \"Come on, Ellen.\"\n\n\"Why wasn't she on the Christmas card?\" DeGeneres then asked. \"Um, I don't know. You gotta ask Kylie,\" Khlo\u00e9 said. \"Why don't you get Kylie on the show?\"\n\nThis banter went on for a few more seconds before DeGeneres said, \"She must be pregnant. There's too much secrecy around it. Look at your eyes! Y'all, she's pregnant.... I will make a bet right now that she is pregnant. I can tell by her eyes.\"\n\nThey never reached a resolution, of course. Khlo\u00e9 just kept smiling and calling DeGeneres \"cute.\" Bahhh, the madness continues. Watch all of this go down:\n\nUnfortunately, it looks like we won't receive anything more concrete until Kylie herself says something\u2014probably on Snapchat.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nKhlo\u00e9 Kardashian Is Officially Six Months Pregnant Today\n\nA Pregnant Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Wore the Sparkliest Naked Jumpsuit on Christmas Eve\n\nKim Kardashian Was Finally Asked, Point-Blank, Whether Kylie Jenner and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Are Pregnant", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/68f8f197354a6f19b50a7952/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691b460729bb852fa68f5a2c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6914b8ca3b12b3ab44344376/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a4e375a750cb37fe7cb4e55/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-480847300.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690e460e839f3ecee7a0b476/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a4e375a750cb37fe7cb4e55/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-480847300.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68d8252693dced9f4dc9df51/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68fa94268b4d1b984ef3ef23/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6903b5c553adbbd18445744c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/69023cabe01a58c3a15bd9f7/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690cc1655625e2a9de14e258/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5e4967dcc142f40008ca7346/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/glamour-banner-v2.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/logo-oneNav.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/652c373eb39fab4f49273738/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6913ad6972a856e01633db66/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a4e375a750cb37fe7cb4e55/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-480847300.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher Rosa"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/khloe-kardashian-asked-about-kylie-jenner-pregnancy-rumors", "title": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Played Super Coy When Asked About Kylie Jenner's Pregnancy Rumors", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Christopher Rosa", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "In a new interview Ellen DeGeneres straight up asks Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian whether Kylie Jenner is pregnant.
