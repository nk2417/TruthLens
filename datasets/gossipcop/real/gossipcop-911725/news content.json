That led to her doing her show I Love You, America, and it led to me wanting to address the issues that I thought led some people to vote the way they did about Brexit, in the area I come from and others like it.\n\n\u201cI felt a responsibility to do something, but it did mean coming back here\u2014which was difficult for us, because we were very important to each other. But we both acknowledge that each of us had to do what we needed to do.\u201d\n\nSheen has since been working with a range of grassroots groups in his hometown in Wales aiming to combat inequality, which includes supporting credit unions and paying for research into ways of funding local journalism.", "images": ["https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/fb.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/email-icon.svg?d=342", "https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/1741381130319.png", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/images/obsessed-header-logo-h-2.png?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/7CBRC2LHIZM4BBTQACFVFKGPGU.jpg?smart=true&auth=6ce36b8de59a62d2578cd69f97e8de32c73b2e4215f20a9249745f6badeee78d&width=1024&height=576", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/7L6PYMCE7RHEBIJZKR23DVTIJI.jpg?smart=true&auth=2558e4fc878237f3ad5bb1aa41ed598bebc770410fe3c21b06f961d190dd7689&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/7CBRC2LHIZM4BBTQACFVFKGPGU.jpg?smart=true&auth=6ce36b8de59a62d2578cd69f97e8de32c73b2e4215f20a9249745f6badeee78d&width=1200&height=630", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/72QNEDSQAVCFHA7Z4MRIDT3K5M.jpg?smart=true&auth=e85c64c943308a204606bc607c0e7733ba520df4c38b4e0e3d31028410470fd8&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/google_play.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/twitter-icon.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/reddit.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/Q6VCSZVA2RAGNOY6RHL3JBDX7U.jpg?smart=true&auth=696d13f7ff11f29130823ec818b6cf4c2a2514821a3fc754adf0dd8b4025ae04&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BFH2PPZ3N5AWTJGR4I7VGCQSD4.jpg?smart=true&auth=306b5742d88bb08e4375bb425722a6636b1c6e2e68736060ebab624f8c524c27&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/app_store.svg?d=342", "https://author-service-images-prod-us-east-1.publishing.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/6c959014-b2c7-4428-a5ce-8039ab8b6701.jpg", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/SDEZH4IJYVANHG7SB7OHOLN25Y.png?smart=true&auth=f6c5d3a487876ce737293fc82e0d933b093632d4a0460243076f5ddaaedf4e9a&width=1440&height=1080"], "top_img": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/7CBRC2LHIZM4BBTQACFVFKGPGU.jpg?smart=true&auth=6ce36b8de59a62d2578cd69f97e8de32c73b2e4215f20a9249745f6badeee78d&width=1200&height=630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tom Sykes", "European Editor At Large", "Tom.Sykes Thedailybeast.Com", "Got A Tip", "Send It To The Daily Beast", "Farrah Tomazin", "Leigh Kimmins", "Julia Ornedo", "Cameron Adams"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/sarah-silverman-and-michael-sheen-broke-up-because-of-trump-and-brexit/", "title": "Sarah Silverman and Michael Sheen Broke Up Because of Trump and Brexit", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "True love proved no match for their passion for politics.
