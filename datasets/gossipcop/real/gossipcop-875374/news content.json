I want to look good, to be fit and to fit into those fancy couture dresses.\"\n\n\"It's always a nail-biting extravaganza at fittings, praying that a few pretty dresses that came down the runway on a teenage model who is a size 0 will miraculously fit my 40-something body,\" she continued. \"It's like a poem: no meat, no wheat, no cheese, no fried foods or sweets. And, of course, no alcohol.\"\n\nLakshmi said she was just about ready to get back to her diet when she noticed that her 7-year-old daughter, Krishna, was starting to pick up on what she was doing.\n\n\"She's noticed, and suddenly, she's told me and others in our circle, 'I don't want to eat because I'm watching my figure,' or, 'I weigh too much,'\" Lakshmi revealed. \"Her comments stopped me dead in my tracks. Her words scared me. Language matters. We send signals to our daughters every day. And I am her first touchstone of femininity.\"\n\n\"Every message I telegraph about food and our bodies is important,\" she added. \"So, this year, I've decided my weight will not be my focus. If I need a bigger dress, so be it. That one day -- or any day -- on the red carpet isn't nearly as important as making sure my daughter doesn't measure her worth by her dress size.\"", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2016-03/1280_Padma_Lakshmi_473377776.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-06/1280_padma_lakshmi_bikini_colorado.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2021-01/gettyimages-1172856817.jpg?h=871deb13&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/gettyimages-489825262_-_h_2017.jpg?h=892dfa59", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/gettyimages-489825262_-_h_2017.jpg?h=892dfa59&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/gettyimages-489825262_-_h_2017.jpg?h=892dfa59", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/padma-lakshmi-says-shes-ditching-her-emmys-diet-because-it-has-negative-impact-her-daughter-85926", "title": "Padma Lakshmi Says She's Ditching Her Emmys Diet Because It Has a 'Negative Impact' on Her Daughter", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/gettyimages-489825262_-_h_2017.jpg?h=892dfa59", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 'Top Chef' star says if she needs a bigger dress this year, 'so be it.'", "title": "Padma Lakshmi Says She's Ditching Her Emmys Diet Because It Has a 'Negative Impact' on Her Daughter", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/padma-lakshmi-says-shes-ditching-her-emmys-diet-because-it-has-negative-impact-her-daughter-85926", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 'Top Chef' star says if she needs a bigger dress this year, 'so be it.'", "twitter": {"description": "The 'Top Chef' star says if she needs a bigger dress this year, 'so be it.'", "title": "Padma Lakshmi Says She's Ditching Her Emmys Diet Because It Has a 'Negative Impact' on Her Daughter", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/padma-lakshmi-says-shes-ditching-her-emmys-diet-because-it-has-negative-impact-her-daughter-85926", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/gettyimages-489825262_-_h_2017.jpg?h=892dfa59", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Padma Lakshmi Says She's Ditching Her Emmys Diet Because It Has a 'Negative Impact' on Her Daughter | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, Awards, News, Padma Lakshmi, Emmys", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
