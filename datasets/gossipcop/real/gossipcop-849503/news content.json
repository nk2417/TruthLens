At last check, Wilkerson manage to rake in 3,432,218 retweets \u2014 compared to 3,430,242 retweets of DeGeneres\u2019 selfie at the 2014 Academy Awards.\n\nUpon his original posting, Wendy\u2019s put the 16-year-old to the challenge, claiming that if he garnered a whopping 18 million retweets, his wish would be their command. \u201cConsider it done,\u201d he replied. Briefly after Wendy\u2019s responded to Wilkinson, the teen took a screenshot of their response and asked the Twitter-world for a little assistance: \u201cHELP ME PLEASE. A MAN NEEDS HIS NUGGS,\u201d he posted.\n\nHELP ME PLEASE.

That\u2019s good for the nuggets, and $100k to @DTFA.
