This isn\u2019t fan laziness, though; it\u2019s clear that at one point, Disick did have his own page, but it\u2019s since been deleted. Perhaps the man values his privacy or this is another example of Kris Jenner trying to control the family\u2019s branding. Whatever the reason, we did a little digging, some actual reporting, and a lot of gathering to bring you the Wikipedia entry LD deserves:\n\nScott Disick\n\nScott \u201cLord\u201d Disick (born May 26, 1983[1]) is an American television personality and entrepreneur. He is best known for being the boyfriend of Kourtney Kardashian and father to their three children: Mason Dash, Penelope Scotland and Reign Aston.[2]\n\nDisick has played himself on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kourtney & Kim Take New York, Lord Disick: Lifestyles of a Lord, Punk\u2019d[3], Kourtney & Kim Take Miami, and Kourtney & Khlo\u00e9 Take the Hamptons.[4]\n\nEarly Life\n\nScott Disick grew up in Eastport, NY. He was an only child to parents Jeffrey and Bonnie Disick.[5] Disick was arrested twice by the time he was 18, once for speeding and once for driving under the influence.[6]\n\nDisick attended The Ross School, a private school in East Hampton.[7] He did not, however, graduate from Ross. [Source: Kristen Hyland, Director of Public Relations].\n\nThere were plenty of rumors about Disick in high school, and he was supposedly a hard partier. His nickname at the time was STD.[8] As a teen, Disick modeled and appeared on the cover of young adult books.[9]\n\nParents\n\nThere are conflicting stories about Disick\u2019s parents and their wealth. According to one source, the family lost its fortune.[10] Other sources say they were wealthy real estate developers and that Disick inherited his money from them.[11] Disick\u2019s grandfather, David M. Disick, was an attorney who became a successful fractional real estate developer, and has developed multiple luxury properties.[12]\n\nDisick\u2019s father was arrested in December 2001 for allegedly stealing $3,000 from a bank in the North Fork and was sentenced to 140 hours of community service.[13] At the time, Jeffrey and Bonnie Disick were reportedly in the hole more than $391,000 thanks to liens and judgements filed by a number of sources, including the federal government.[14]\n\nAt the age of 63, Disick\u2019s mother Bonnie died October 2013 after a \u201clong illness.\u201d[15] Three months later, his father Jeffrey passed away.[16] Both causes of death are unclear; Scott has said that his father suffered from cancer. According to a source, he was living in a Los Angeles nursing home when he died.[17]\n\nCareer\n\nDisick has tried his hand at many entrepreneurial ventures. He has released a tanning product for men called Monte Carlo (tag line: \u201cIt\u2019s like liquid sunshine.\u201d)[18] and has also worked on a line of menopause supplements for men called Amidren by Scott Disick.[19][20] He has said that he has, \u201cdone a lot of private label manufacturing in the nutrition biz\u201d and \u201craised money for startup companies.\u201d[21] He also opened a Japanese restaurant in New York, Ryu, but soon cut ties with it.[22] It has since closed.[23]\n\nThough Disick has said he works for GNC[24][25], a company rep denies that claim, saying, \u201cScott Disick does not work for GNC and the company has no business relationship with him.\u201d [Source: Laura Brophy, Director of Client Services and New Business Development]\n\nKardashian and Disick at the opening of Ryu. Photo: Getty Images\n\nOn Kourtney & Khlo\u00e9 Take the Hamptons, Disick frequently references paid hosting gigs for clubs such as 1OAK.[26] He has also hosted pool parties at casinos, such as one at Harrah\u2019s Resort in Atlantic City, for which he was paid $50,000 [27] [28] His net worth has been estimated at $12 million.[29]\n\nRelationship with Kourtney Kardashian\n\nKardashian and Disick began dating in 2006.[30] It is unclear how the two met, though some gossip sources say it was in a club. Kardashian family friend and Girls Gone Wild creator Joe Francis has said he introduced them at a party at his home.[31]\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians debuted in 2007, and the drama of the couple\u2019s relationship became a popular subplot. After finding text messages on Disick\u2019s phone addressed to \u201cmy wife,\u201d[32] Kardashian broke up in Disick 2009 before realizing she was pregnant. Son Mason was born December of that year and the couple reconciled. In 2010, Disick proposed but Kardashian turned him down.[33] The couple\u2019s daughter, Penelope, was born on July 8, 2012 and their third child and second son, Reign, was born on Mason\u2019s fifth birthday, December 14, 2014.[34]\n\nAfter paparazzi photographs of Scott canoodling with former flame Chloe Bartoli in Monte Carlo surfaced last week, sources confirm to E! News that Kourtney has ended her relationship with Scott.[35][36] Said the source, \u201cKourtney has always taken Scott back and been by his side, but now with three kids it has gotten old. Kourtney has to do what\u2019s best for the kids.\u201d\n\nFun Facts\n\nDisick bought a knighting ceremony for himself over the internet, after which he urged family members and friends to refer to him as \u201cLord Disick,\u201d \u201cThe Lord,\u201d or \u201cLD.\u201d[37] He doesn\u2019t like coasters because he doesn\u2019t \u201crespect surfaces.\u201d[38] Disick loves snowboarding,[39] and enjoys unwinding at night to reruns of Seinfeld.[40]", "images": ["https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8873873/467001116.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0.075000000000003%2C0%2C99.85%2C100&w=2400", "https://www.google-analytics.com/g/collect?v=2&tid=G-C3QZPB4GVE&cid=555&en=noscript_page_view", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23263816/GettyImages_1316434483.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.025138260432378%2C100%2C99.949723479135&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2943824/ScottDisickRyu_2015_1.0.jpg", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25435560/1175341681.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=14.032825322392%2C0%2C71.934349355217%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25203697/Screen_Shot_2024_01_04_at_10.24.42_AM.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=43.321299638989%2C0%2C56.678700361011%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25435560/1175341681.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C3.6614515428075%2C100%2C92.677096914385&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2943818/ScottDisickWiki_2015_11.0.jpg", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13212283/158574425.0.0.1423537008.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.276160134743%2C100%2C79.447679730513&w=1200", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13212283/158574425.0.0.1423537008.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0.575%2C0%2C98.85%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25203697/Screen_Shot_2024_01_04_at_10.24.42_AM.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=14.981949458484%2C0%2C85.018050541516%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25227598/Screen_Shot_2024_01_15_at_10.21.12_AM.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.050813008130078%2C100%2C99.89837398374&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2943822/MonteCarloTanning_2015_1.0.jpg", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8873873/467001116.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.716666666667%2C0%2C66.566666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25227598/Screen_Shot_2024_01_15_at_10.21.12_AM.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.632756866734%2C0%2C66.734486266531%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24574822/GettyImages_1248336813.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.029603315571343%2C100%2C99.940793368857&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23263816/GettyImages_1316434483.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.649899396378%2C0%2C66.700201207243%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2943820/ScottDisickTeenModel_2015_1.0.jpg", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/24574822/GettyImages_1248336813.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.64691943128%2C0%2C66.706161137441%2C100&w=2400"], "top_img": "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13212283/158574425.0.0.1423537008.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.276160134743%2C100%2C79.447679730513&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leslie Price"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/2015/1/2/7562751/scott-disick-wikipedia", "title": "The Wikipedia Entry Scott Disick Deserves", "meta_data": {"bingbot": "nocache", "description": "Vox is a general interest news site for the 21st century.
