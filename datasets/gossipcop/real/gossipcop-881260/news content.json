The person also claimed to have seen Hart partying in Las Vegas last month, and accused the actor of cheating on Parrish with several women.\n\nHart Apologized for His \u2018Mistakes\u2019 in an Emotional Video\n\nBefore news of the alleged extortion broke, Hart shared an Instagram video in which he revealed that a person was trying to make \u201cfinancial gain\u201d off of his past misbehavior and apologized to his family.\n\nInstagram\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at a place in my life where I feel like I have a target on my back,\u201d Hart, 38, said in the clip. \u201cAnd because of that I should make smart decisions. And recently, I didn\u2019t. You know, I\u2019m not perfect. I\u2019m not going to sit up here and say that I am or claim to be in any way shape or form.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cI made a bad error in judgement and I put myself in a bad environment where only bad things can happen and they did. And in doing that I know that I\u2019m going to hurt the people closest to me, who\u2019ve I talked to and apologized to, that would be my wife and my kids.\u201d\n\nHart, who\u2019s dad to daughter Heaven, 12, and son Hendrix, 9, with ex-wife Torrei and is expecting a baby boy with Parrish, added that there are no excuses for his \u201cwrong behavior\u201d and described the situation as a \u201cs\u2014-y moment.\u201d\n\nHart captioned the video: \u201cSending so many apologies to my wife & kids. I gotta do better and I will. I\u2019m not perfect and have never claimed to be \u2026I love you all.\u201d\n\nParrish was photographed Sunday with her wedding ring on, walking her dog in L.A.\n\nHart Was Accused of Cheating on Parrish Over the Summer\n\nIn July, the Ride Along actor laughed off rumors that he cheated on his 32-year-old wife with a woman that he met in a Miami Beach nightclub.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, you just gotta laugh at the BS,\u201d Hart wrote alongside an Instagram photo of himself mid-cackle seemingly dismissing the claims. \u201c#LiveLoveLaugh \u2026.. [Shaking my damn head].\u201d\n\nRumors swirled after photos surfaced online showing him in a car with a woman after a Miami Beach nightclub appearance.\n\nThe shots quickly caught the attention of the Twittersphere, and Hart\u2019s name trended on the social media site.\n\nAllen Berezovsky/Getty; Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nHart\u2019s Ex-Wife Claimed That He Cheated on Her with Parrish While They Were Married\n\nHart was again forced to address rumors of infidelity a month later, in August, when his ex-wife, Torrei, claimed that Hart and Parrish started dating before he split from Torrei.\n\nParrish caused a stir on social media when she wrote on Instagram that she and Hart had been together for the past eight years. Fans and followers were quick to point out that Hart and Torrei got divorced six years ago.\n\n\u201cNumbers don\u2019t lie. Dates don\u2019t lie at the end of the day,\u201d Torrei told TMZ after she and Parrish went back and forth in a series of now-deleted Instagram comments.\n\nKevin Hart\u2019s Ex-Wife Torrei Says He Was Cheating on Her with Current Wife Eniko Parrish\n\n\u201cShe forced my hand to address this publicly. The most important thing to me is my children, so if my children see something that she\u2019s writing that makes me look like a liar, no.\u201d\n\nParrish responded in a since-deleted comment: \u201cTheir marriage was broken way before I came in the picture. They were separated living in separate homes. I was never a secret.\u201d\n\nHart appeared to address Torrei\u2019s claims in a video on his Instagram Story, saying, \u201cGoing to be honest with you people, I\u2019m at a point where I can\u2019t even be shocked anymore. All I do is laugh man.\u201d\n\nHart and Parrish, 32, married last August in a lavish California ceremony after a two-year engagement. The couple broke their baby news in May, telling PEOPLE that they are expecting their first child together \u2014 a little boy.", "images":
