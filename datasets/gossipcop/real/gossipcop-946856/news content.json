The uneasy balance between these worlds is shattered when Starr witnesses the fatal shooting of her childhood best friend Khalil at the hands of a police officer. Now, facing pressures from all sides of the community, Starr must find her voice and stand up for what\u2019s right.\n\nThe trailer shows the cop, who is white, shooting the teen, who is black, after he reached for a hairbrush in the car as a joke after a traffic stop.\n\nDirected by George Tillman Jr. and adapted by screenwriter Audrey Wells, the movie also stars Regina Hall, Russell Hornsby, Issa Rae, KJ Apa, Algee Smith, Sabrina Carpenter, Common and Anthony Mackie.\n\nThe Hate U Give hits theaters Oct. 19.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hate_0.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hate_0.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kimberly Nordyke", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/hate-u-give-racial-tensions-flare-up-first-trailer-1122976/", "title": "\u2018The Hate U Give\u2019 Trailer: Racial Tensions Flare Up After White Cop Fatally Shoots Black Teen", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "20th Century Fox on Sunday released the first trailer for its upcoming adaptation of Angie Thomas' best-selling book 'The Hate U Give,' starring Amandla Stenberg.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Kimberly Nordyke", "tags": "Amandla Stenberg, The Hate U Give", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018The Hate U Give\u2019 Trailer: Racial Tensions Flare Up After White Cop Fatally Shoots Black Teen", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/hate-u-give-racial-tensions-flare-up-first-trailer-1122976/", "description": "20th Century Fox on Sunday released the first trailer for its upcoming adaptation of Angie Thomas' best-selling book 'The Hate U Give,' starring Amandla Stenberg.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hate_0.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "'The Hate U Give': Racial Tensions Flare Up in First Trailer"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-24T18:59:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-27T14:13:43+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "20th Century Fox on Sunday released the first trailer for its upcoming adaptation of Angie Thomas' best-selling book 'The Hate U Give,' starring Amandla Stenberg.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018The Hate U Give\u2019 Trailer: Racial Tensions Flare Up After White Cop Fatally Shoots Black Teen", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hate_0.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529866749.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
