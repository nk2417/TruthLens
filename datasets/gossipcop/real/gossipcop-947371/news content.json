However, while many of these f\u00eates involve a range of loved ones of different ages, the bachelorette party is a time for the bride and her closest friends to honor her upcoming nuptials. In prior decades, this type of affair may have meant a dinner out with a few friends followed by a few hours of barhopping. Yet in the modern era, more brides are deciding to host their bachelorette party at a dream destination, booking a weekend away for themselves and those they love.\n\nAccording to Abbie Clinton, the CEO and owner of bachelorette-party planning company Got Your Bash, the average cost of a bachelorette party is about $1,000 per person for a three-night stay, excluding flights. And with the influence of social media, these pre-wedding soir\u00e9es are only getting more expensive, Clinton says. Although destination bachelorette parties are known to be the most costly since flights, hotels, and car rentals come with a hefty price tag, a single night on the town that includes a dinner, drinks, transportation, and a new outfit can still adds up. As a result, whether you're the bride or an invitee to such a getaway, you may be left wondering: Who pays for the bachelorette party?\n\nHere, we asked Clinton to give us the breakdown on who really pays for the bachelorette party. Read on to discover who\u2019s responsible for which costs.\n\njacoblund / Getty Images\n\nWho Pays for the Bachelorette Party?\n\nAlthough most groups will figure out a system that works best for them, the rule of who pays for the bachelorette party ultimately depends on the location.\n\nWho Pays for a Local Bachelorette Party?\n\nIf you\u2019re hosting or attending a local bachelorette party that's a night on the town, rather than a weekend getaway, the bridesmaids and any other invited guests are expected to pay for their own share of the bill, plus the bride\u2019s expenses, such as dinner, drinks, and other activities.\n\nWho Pays for a Destination Bachelorette Party?\n\nHowever, if you're jetting off to another destination for multiple days, expenses become a bit more nuanced. Whether you\u2019re headed to San Diego or Puerto Rico for a weekend away, these trips require spending a significant amount of money on travel, accommodations, meals, activities, and more. Typically, the host and the rest of the guests usually pay for their own costs, but not the bride\u2019s. \u201cAs a bride, if you\u2019re expecting your guests to travel a ways away, [you should help] out with extra costs,\u201d Clinton says.\n\nThe bride should cover her own airfare and share of the lodging. Sometimes, she\u2019ll even chip in to alleviate the financial burden of her loved ones. \u201cAs a destination bachelorette bride myself, I\u2019m helping with lodging accommodations because I was so appreciative of all my guests traveling for my bachelorette,\u201d Clinton says. The bride may even purchase gifts for the attendees to show her gratitude.\n\nFrom there, it\u2019s up to the group to decide what else they want to pay for. For instance, the maid of honor may decide to stock the bride\u2019s hotel room with supplies and decorations. Attendees might also want to treat the bride to dinner and drinks one night. However, for the majority of the outings, the bride is expected to cover her own expenses.\n\n\n\nizusek / Getty Images\n\nHow to Deal With Bachelorette-Party Finances\n\nThe responsibility of setting, managing, and tracking the budget falls on the person who is tasked with planning and hosting the bachelorette party (which is typically the maid of honor). If you\u2019re in charge of spearheading this pre-wedding event, here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to dealing with the finances.\n\nConsult the Group\n\nBefore you make any decisions, like the destination, the hotel, or even an activity, have a conversation about the budget with anyone on the guest list. Since each individual will be financially contributing to the celebration, everyone should feel comfortable with the final amount. However, instead of holding a group discussion, which could sway each person\u2019s response, Clinton suggests speaking with each person person individually. \u201cWe always recommend sending out a poll to your guests before you start planning and asking all your guests anonymously what they feel comfortable spending,\u201d she says.\n\nEstablish a Realistic Budget\n\nAfter you take everyone\u2019s responses into consideration, set a budget that accommodates each request and financial status. Make sure to share the price point with the group, so everyone can decide whether or not they\u2019re able to attend. \u201cThe best thing to do is be completely transparent from the beginning of the planning process,\u201d Clinton says. Once you have your final number of attendees confirmed, start booking accommodations, planning activities, and making reservations.\n\nMake the Payments\n\nAs the one hosting the bachelorette party, you\u2019re in charge of making the payments\u2014from the hotel to the group yoga class. Many hosts choose to put all of the expenses on their credit card and then have everyone pay them back via Venmo or Splitwise at the end of the celebration.\n\nTrack the Expenses\n\nFrom the prepaid happenings to what's purchased on the actual trip, you\u2019ll need to keep tabs on every expense, so you can charge each person the right amount. \u201cTrack what\u2019s coming in and what\u2019s going out,\u201d Clinton says. Save all of your receipts and make a spreadsheet to input every bill.\n\nSouth_agency / Getty Images\n\n3 Tips to Save Money on the Bachelorette Party\n\nA bachelorette party doesn't have to be expensive. Here, Clinton offers some key ways to save money on this celebration.\n\nLook at More Affordable Accommodations\n\nInstead of splurging on a costly resort, consider a less expensive option, like an Airbnb. Once you figure out which area you want to stay in, look at a few lodging spots that are within the price range. To keep costs down even more, Clinton recommends reaching out to the rental company instead of booking through Airbnb, so you can bypass some of the fees.\n\nAdd Budget-Friendly Activities to the Itinerary\n\nIf the bride has requested some high-cost activities, like getting a massage or a facial, make sure to incorporate ones that are more affordable or free, such as a local hike, a picnic in the park, or window shopping. You can also make the big-budget tasks optional, so those who don\u2019t feel comfortable spending a large sum can opt out.\n\nConsider a Unique Alternative\n\nWeekends away are the most pricey types of bachelorette parties, so the best way to save money is forgoing a multi-day affair all together. Consider an alternative that costs little to no money, like an at-home movie night, a pottery-making session, or a group cooking class.", "images":
