And though sometimes these visionary looks can feel unwearable in the real world, there are a few beauty tips to be gleaned for your everyday beauty routine that can turn the ordinary into the extraordinary. Here are nine next-level beauty tricks we\u2026\n\n9 Backstage Beauty Tips We Picked Up From The Pros Crimson Vibe At Sies Marjan, makeup artist Thomas de Kluyver played with facial perspectives by plumping up lips while downplaying eyes by keeping them bare. By slightly overdrawing the mouth with MAC\u2019s Lady Danger, a vibrant hue, the dramatic pouts packed an even greater punch.

The tackiness of the emollient sticks to skin, giving eyelids a fresh dewiness that won\u2019t budge. Just be sure to apply your mascara beforehand, otherwise the ink may unintentionally drop and adhere to your lids.

We\u2019re talking a dark matte cherry in the center, followed by a lighter wine shade all over, accented by a bright cherry on the outer rims and a deep wine liner on the inside, all topped off with a slick coat of berry for a rich \"petal\" effect.
