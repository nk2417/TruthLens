{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Anka", "text": "Canadian-American singer and actor (born 1941)\n\nPaul Albert Anka (born July 30, 1941) is a Canadian and American singer, songwriter and actor. His songs include \"Diana\", \"You Are My Destiny\", \"Lonely Boy\", \"Put Your Head on My Shoulder\", and \"(You're) Having My Baby\".\n\nAnka also wrote the theme for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson; one of Tom Jones' biggest hits, \"She's a Lady\"; and the English lyrics to Claude Fran\u00e7ois and Jacques Revaux's music for Frank Sinatra's signature song \"My Way\", which has been recorded by many, including Elvis Presley. He co-wrote three songs with Michael Jackson: \"This Is It\" (originally titled \"I Never Heard\"),[1] \"Love Never Felt So Good\", and \"Don't Matter to Me\", which became posthumous hits for Jackson in 2009, 2014, and 2018, respectively.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nPaul Albert Anka was born in Ottawa, Ontario, to Camelia (n\u00e9e Tannis) and Andrew Emile \"Andy\" Anka Sr., who owned a restaurant called the Locanda.[2] According to Anka's autobiography, My Way, both of his parents were of Lebanese Christian descent; however, he also states in his autobiography that his ancestors came from Bab Tuma, in Syria.[3][4] His father came to Canada from Damascus, Syria, and his mother was an immigrant from Lebanon.[5][6] His mother died when he was 18.[7]\n\nAnka briefly studied piano under Winifred Rees[8] [9] and sang with the St. Elias Antiochian Orthodox Cathedral choir under the direction of Frederick Karam, with whom he studied music theory.[10] He attended Fisher Park High School, where he was part of a vocal trio called the Bobby Soxers.[11][12]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nEarly success [ edit ]\n\nAnka at Gr\u00f6na Lund in Stockholm, 1959\n\nAnka recorded his first single, \"I Confess\", when he was 14. In 1956, with $100 given to him by his uncle, he went to New York City, where he auditioned for Don Costa at ABC Records, singing what was widely believed to be a lovestruck verse he had written to a former babysitter. In an interview with NPR's Terry Gross in 2005, he stated that it was to a girl at his church whom he hardly knew.[13] The resulting song \"Diana\" brought Anka stardom as it went to No. 1 on the Canadian and US music charts.[14] \"Diana\" is one of the best selling singles ever by a Canadian recording artist.[15] He followed up with four songs that made it into the Top 20 in 1958,[16] including \"It's Time to Cry\", which hit No. 4 and \"(All of a Sudden) My Heart Sings\", which reached No. 15, making him (at 17) one of the biggest teen idols of the time. He toured Britain, then Australia with Buddy Holly. Anka also wrote \"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\" \u2013 a song written for Holly, which Holly recorded just before he died in 1959. Anka stated shortly afterward:\n\n\"It Doesn't Matter Anymore\" has a tragic irony about it now, but at least it will help look after Buddy Holly's family. I'm giving my composer's royalty to his widow \u2013 it's the least I can do.[17]\n\nAnka in 1961\n\nAnka composed the theme for The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (reworked in 1962 from a song Anka wrote earlier called \"Toot Sweet\"; it had been rewritten with lyrics and recorded by Annette Funicello in 1959 as \"It's Really Love\").[18] He wrote \"Teddy\" \u2013 a Top 20 hit for Connie Francis in 1960. Anka wrote the English lyrics to \"My Way\", Frank Sinatra's signature song (originally the French song \"Comme d'habitude\"). In the 1960s, Anka began acting in motion pictures as well as writing songs for them, most notably the theme for the hit film The Longest Day (which also was the official march of the Canadian Airborne Regiment), in which he made a cameo appearance as a U.S. Army Ranger. For his film work he wrote and recorded one of his greatest hits \"Lonely Boy\". He also wrote and recorded \"My Home Town\", which was a No. 8 pop hit for him the same year. He then went on to become one of the first pop singers to perform at the Las Vegas casinos. In 1960, he appeared twice as himself in NBC's short-lived crime drama Dan Raven.\n\nIn 1963, Anka purchased the rights and ownership of his ABC-Paramount catalog and re-recorded his earlier hits for RCA Victor, which he had joined in 1960.[19]\n\n1970s breakthrough and chart comebacks [ edit ]\n\nFrustrated after more than ten years without a top 25 hit record, Anka switched labels again, which marked a turning point in his career. This time he signed with United Artists and in 1974 teamed up with Odia Coates to record the No. 1 hit, \"(You're) Having My Baby\", exposing Anka to a new generation of fans and proving his staying power among his original fan base that was now maturing.[20]\n\nAnka also wrote five songs which were included on an album by Don Goodwin.[21]\n\nAnka and Coates recorded three more duets that made it into the Top 20: \"One Man Woman/One Woman Man\" ( No. 7), \"I Don't Like to Sleep Alone\" ( No. 8), and the No. 15 duet \"(I Believe) There's Nothing Stronger Than Our Love\". In 1975, he recorded a jingle for Kodak written by Bill Lane (lyrics) and Roger Nichols (melody) called \"Times of Your Life\". It became so popular Anka recorded it as a full song, which peaked at No. 7 in the US pop chart in 1976. The follow-up was another hit that Anka wrote for Sinatra, \"Anytime (I'll Be There)\", peaking at No. 33. Anka's last Top 40 hit in the US was in the summer of 1983: \"Hold Me 'Til the Mornin' Comes\",[20] which included backing vocals from then-Chicago frontman Peter Cetera; it hit No. 2 on the Hot Adult Contemporary chart.[22]\n\n1990s comeback [ edit ]\n\nAnka's 1998 album A Body of Work was his first new US studio release since Walk a Fine Line in 1983; vocalists and performers included Celine Dion, Kenny G, Patti LaBelle, and Skyler Jett. The album included a new version of \"Hold Me 'Til the Morning Comes\", once again performed with Peter Cetera. In 2005, Anka released an album of big-band arrangements of contemporary Rock songs titled, Rock Swings; the album provided a mainstream comeback of sorts that saw Anka awarded a star on Canada's Walk of Fame in Toronto.\n\nOn October 12, 2009, Anka stated that Michael Jackson's new release titled \"This Is It\" was a collaborative effort between the two in 1980. According to Anka, after recording the song, Jackson decided not to use it and the tune was then recorded and released by Sa-Fire. After Anka threatened to sue for credit and a share of royalties, the administrators of Jackson's estate granted Anka 50% of the copyright.[23] An additional song that Jackson co-wrote with Anka from this 1980 session, \"Love Never Felt So Good\", was discovered shortly thereafter. His album Songs of December charted at No. 58 in Canada in November 2011.[24]\n\nItaly [ edit ]\n\nAnka collaborated with a number of Italian musicians, including composer/director Ennio Morricone, singer-songwriter Lucio Battisti, and lyricist Mogol. His official discography reports nine singles released by RCA Italiana,[25] but the Italian charts list at least six other songs he interpreted or recorded in Italian. His top hit was \"Ogni giorno\" which scored No. 1 in 1962, followed by \"Pianger\u00f2 per te\" and \"Ogni volta\", which reached both No. 2, in 1963 and 1964. \"Ogni volta\" (\"Every Time\") was sung by Anka during the Festival di Sanremo of 1964 and then sold more than one million copies in Italy alone; it was also awarded a gold disc.[26]\n\nHe returned to Sanremo in 1968 with \"La farfalla impazzita\" by Battisti-Mogol. On that occasion, the same title was interpreted by Italian crooner Johnny Dorelli. The pair of singers, however, were eliminated before the final stage of the musical contest. Anka, maybe only coincidentally, left the Italian scene shortly thereafter. In 2003, Anka came back with an exclusive concert in Bologna, organized by the Italian company Mapei during the CERSAIE exhibition. He recorded a version of \"My Way\" with alternate lyrics dedicated to the sponsor of the evening. [citation needed]\n\nIn 2006, he recorded a duet with 1960s Italian hitmaker Adriano Celentano, a new cover of \"Diana\", with Italian lyrics by Celentano-Mogol and with singer-songwriter Alex Britti on the guitar.[27] The song hit No. 3.\n\nFinland [ edit ]\n\nPaul Anka posing for a camera at Linnanm\u00e4ki summer concert on August 19, 1959, in Helsinki, Finland\n\nAnka has been very popular in Finland since the beginning of his career. He performed in Helsinki's Linnanm\u00e4ki in 1959,[28][29] in Lappeenranta in 1989, at the Pori Jazz Festival in Pori on 19 July 2007 and in 2012, and in Tampere three times on 6 August 2008 and on 9 and 10 August 2009. He also appeared in the Las Vegas scene in the 1991 Finnish film Prince of the Hit Parade (Iskelm\u00e4prinssi), directed by Juha Tapaninen.[30] At the end of the film there is an archive footage of Anka's performance in Linnanm\u00e4ki. As background music, Anka performs his song \"How Long\" in the film.\n\nOther countries [ edit ]\n\nWith less success than in Italy and Finland, Anka tried the French market as well, with his first song being \"Comme Avant\"[25] with Mireille Mathieu. In 1964, he released an album titled Paul Anka \u00e0 Paris; the six tracks on side B were sung in French. A single release in Japanese (\"Kokoro no Sasae\"/\"Shiawase e no Tabiji\") is also reported on his discography. In 1993, he recorded a duet with Filipino singer Regine Velasquez titled \"It's Hard to Say Goodbye\", included on her album Reason Enough. This song was re-recorded several years later by Anka and Celine Dion and was included on his album A Body of Work.[20][31]\n\nAnka has performed four times in Israel,[32] and in 2019 rejected pleas that he boycott the country.[33]\n\nActing career [ edit ]\n\nAnka appeared in 1958's \"Let's Rock\", where he sang and appeared in a scene signing autographs. His first major-film acting role was in a cameo as an army private in The Longest Day (1962). He also composed the title song to the movie. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, he starred in such teen exploitation films as Girls Town (1959) and Look in Any Window (1961), in which he played a peeping tom. He later played an Elvis-hating casino pit manager in 3000 Miles to Graceland (2001) and a yacht broker in Captain Ron (1992). He guest-starred as a murder suspect in one of the Perry Mason Made-for-TV movies, The Case of the Maligned Mobster (1991). He made guest appearances as himself in the episode \"Red's Last Day\" on That '70s Show and in \"The Real Paul Anka\" episode of Gilmore Girls. He made several appearances on the NBC TV series Las Vegas. In 2016, he made another guest appearance as himself in the \"Spring\" episode of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, a revival of the original show.[34]\n\nOther film and television appearances [ edit ]\n\nAnka was the subject of the 1962 NFB documentary Lonely Boy, considered a classic work of cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9.[35] He wrote and performed songs in the 1985 Canadian children's Christmas cartoon George and the Christmas Star. He appeared on The Simpsons season 7 episode Treehouse of Horror VI, Attack of the 50 Ft Eyesore, singing a song with Lisa in October 1995. In American Idol's seasons 2 and 3, he made a special appearance and sang an adapted version of \"My Way\" that mocked the format of the show as well as participants, judges, and the host. The performance was praised as one of the best moments of the show. He also played the role of Buddy Maus in Season 2 Episode 14 \"The Betrayal\" of the TV show Kojak.\n\nAnka appeared in an episode of The Morecambe and Wise Show in 1970, singing his own lyrics 'My Way'.[36] The show was broadcast again on BBC2 on Christmas Day 2021, after the tape recording - believed lost - was found.[37]\n\nAnka appeared as himself in the American sitcom That 70s Show in season 2, episode 2 \"Red\u2019s Last Day\".[38]\n\nOn Gilmore Girls, Lorelai Gilmore named her Polish Lowland Sheepdog after Anka.[39] Series co-creator Daniel Palladino chose the name after hearing the Rock Swings album at a coffeehouse.[40] Both Paul Ankas were featured in a dream sequence Lorelai describes to her daughter Rory in the cold open to \"The Real Paul Anka\", the eighteenth episode of Season 6.[41][42]\n\nAnka competed in season four of The Masked Singer as \"Broccoli\". He ended up finishing in 7th place during the Group C finals.[43]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nAnka, 2007\n\nAnka was married to Anne de Zogheb, the half-English and half-Lebanese[44] daughter of Lebanese diplomat Charles de Zogheb, from February 16, 1963 to 2001.[45] The couple met in 1962 in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where she was a fashion model on assignment and under contract to the Eileen Ford Agency. Zogheb, brought up in Egypt,[46] is of Lebanese, English, Dutch, French, German, and Greek[46] descent. The couple married the following year in a ceremony at Paris-Orly Airport. Through his daughter Amanda, he is the father-in-law of the actor Jason Bateman.[47]\n\nOn September 6, 1990, Anka became a naturalized citizen of the United States.[48]\n\nIn 2008, Anka married his personal trainer, Anna \u00c5berg, in Sardinia, Italy.[49] They divorced in 2010, and Paul has full custody of their son. Anna was featured in the Swedish TV3 show Svenska Hollywoodfruar (Swedish Hollywood Wives).\n\nAnka's autobiography, My Way, co-written with David Dalton, was published in 2013.[50]\n\nAnka in a cameo role for the crime drama television show Dan Raven, 1960\n\nIn October 2016, Anka married Lisa Pemberton in Beverly Hills, California.[51] They divorced in 2020.[52]\n\nAwards and honours [ edit ]\n\nIn 1972, a street in Ottawa was named Paul Anka Drive.[53] In 1981, the Ottawa City Council named August 26 as \"Paul Anka Day\" to celebrate his quarter-century in show business.[54]\n\n2004 Appointed an Officer Of The Order of Canada\n\nIn popular culture [ edit ]\n\nIn the mid-1980s,[55] Anka was secretly recorded while launching a tirade against his crew and band members, berating them for behavior that he considered unprofessional. When asked about it on the interview program Fresh Air, he referred to the person who did the recording as a \"snake we later fired\". The recording became widely known after being uploaded to the internet around 2004, and a number of quotes from it became famous, including \"The guys get shirts!\"; \"Don't make a maniac out of me!\"; and \"Slice like a f*****g hammer!\"[56] Some of the quotes were reproduced by Al Pacino's character in the 2007 film Ocean's Thirteen.[55] In the TV show Gilmore Girls, Lorelai Gilmore names her dog Paul Anka.[57] He is also briefly mentioned in Finnish road movie Rumble, as the father figure of the movie's main character group mentions \"being with Paul Anka in Linnanm\u00e4ki amusement park\".\n\nBusiness ventures [ edit ]\n\nIn 2012, Anka co-founded the holographic tech startup, ARHT Media.[58] He is currently a member of ARHT Media's Board of Advisors, alongside businessman Kevin O'Leary and former prime minister Brian Mulroney until the latter's death in February, 2024.[59]\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nAlbums [ edit ]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nWorks cited", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2c/Paul_Anka_Gr%C3%B6na_Lund_1959.jpg/250px-Paul_Anka_Gr%C3%B6na_Lund_1959.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Paul_Anka_performing_at_Caesars_Windsor%2C_2024-05-24_10.jpg/960px-Paul_Anka_performing_at_Caesars_Windsor%2C_2024-05-24_10.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Paul-Anka-1959.jpg/250px-Paul-Anka-1959.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Paul_Anka_1961.JPG/250px-Paul_Anka_1961.JPG", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Bill_Elvis_Paul.jpg/250px-Bill_Elvis_Paul.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/PaulAnka07.jpg/250px-PaulAnka07.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Paul_Anka_performing_at_Caesars_Windsor%2C_2024-05-24_10.jpg/250px-Paul_Anka_performing_at_Caesars_Windsor%2C_2024-05-24_10.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d8/Paul_Anka_star_on_Walk_of_Fame.jpg/250px-Paul_Anka_star_on_Walk_of_Fame.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/40px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Paul_Anka_Skip_Homeier_Dan_Raven_1960_%28cropped%29.JPG/168px-Paul_Anka_Skip_Homeier_Dan_Raven_1960_%28cropped%29.JPG", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Paul_Anka_performing_at_Caesars_Windsor%2C_2024-05-24_10.jpg/960px-Paul_Anka_performing_at_Caesars_Windsor%2C_2024-05-24_10.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Anka", "title": "Paul Anka", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.3", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/Paul_Anka_performing_at_Caesars_Windsor%2C_2024-05-24_10.jpg/960px-Paul_Anka_performing_at_Caesars_Windsor%2C_2024-05-24_10.jpg", "width": 810, "height": 1200}, "title": "Paul Anka - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
