Tuesday\u2019s episode introduced a seismic shift in the cult\u2019s dynamic, but it also folded in one big inconsistency\u2014one that could either be a huge plot hole at the core of the series or might just turn out to be a clue about what\u2019s to come.\n\nA refresher: after Meadow\u2019s staged assassination attempt on Kai and subsequent suicide, Ally\u2014who was found holding the gun Meadow used to commit the mass shooting\u2014was detained by police. Ivy notes that it\u2019s unclear where Ally is now, but the cult has bigger things to deal with anyway.\n\nIt seems Kai is reneging on his vow to Beverly Hope (Adina Porter), and Beverly is not happy about it\u2014especially as Kai begins to surround himself with new, very white, very male followers. Coincidentally, Beverly runs into Bebe Babbit (Conroy), an ex-lover of Valerie Solanas\u2014the former Warhol hanger-on who wrote the S.C.U.M. Manifesto asserting that men need to be purged from the Earth. Beverly brings Bebe to meet with the other women in the cult, where Bebe tells them all about her time with Valerie\u2014who, according to Bebe, formed a cult of her own. She says that the women of S.C.U.M. committed several grisly murders\u2014all of which got attributed to the Zodiac Killer. (Solanas and S.C.U.M. are real; the murders, probably, are not.)\n\nThis is where the story gets interesting\u2014and potentially problematic for the A.H.S. universe.\n\nAccording to Bebe\u2019s story, one of two gay men within S.C.U.M.\u2019s ranks was the one who sent letters to the press claiming to be the Zodiac Killer. In Season 5, however, American Horror Story itself showed the \u201cZodiac Killer\u201d on Devil\u2019s Night, when a group of serial killer spirits gathered at the Hotel Cortez to hang out with James March (Evan Peters)\u2014indicating that in the A.H.S. universe, the Zodiac murders were in fact committed by a lone-wolf Zodiac killer.\n\nDid the show just accidentally paint itself into a corner? Maybe\u2014but maybe not. After Bebe\u2019s story, the women of Kai\u2019s cult are mad as hell and ready to send a message: they won\u2019t be taken for granted any longer. Among the group is Winter, who speaks briefly with Kai in their dead parents\u2019 bedroom. He asks if he can trust her, and asks her about the S.C.U.M. pamphlet he found in her room. She tries to brush it off\u2014but he seems intrigued by the anti-male movement, and is inspired by it to come up with an acronym motto of his own. Kai comes up with \u201cM.L.W.B.\u201d\u2014for \u201cMen Lead, Women Bleed\u201d\u2014and when Winter dismisses it, he claims Harrison came up with the idea. Then, like clockwork, the women kill Harrison for letting Meadow be manipulated by Kai. (A choice line from Ivy: \u201cI just drove my wife crazy; I didn\u2019t get her killed!\u201d)", "images":
