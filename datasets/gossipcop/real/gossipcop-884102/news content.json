We were living in hell because he was in such a dark place.\"\n\n\u201cI have inconveniences, and other people have problems. Mine feel important, but they\u2019re not. They\u2019re not life or death,\" he explains. \"Justin\u2019s stuff got to a point where it was a problem.\u201d\n\nWhile Bieber continued to struggle, Braun, who discovered the singer on YouTube when he was 12, says he never lost hope that he could bring his client back.\n\n\u201cSome of the biggest people in the industry, people invested in Justin\u2019s career, told me, \u2018It\u2019s over. Focus on something else. That kid is done,'\" he confesses. \u201cI made a promise to him when he was 13 that I would never give up on him. I plan on keeping that promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s family. I think the relationship is more like a big brother, especially because he\u2019s become a man,\u201d Braun adds. \u201cI think he\u2019s seen the worst of himself, and to watch him rise out of it was amazing.\u201d\n\nBieber, too, admits that his and Braun's relationship transcends business. \"He\u2019s great at what he does. But more than that, I am proud of what a good man he is,\u201d he says. \u201cHe changed my life. He is the best in the business.\"\n\nBy now, Braun is used to handling big personalities -- Kanye West's included.\n\n\u201cI said no nine times when Kanye asked me to work with him, because I liked being friends with him,\u201d he reveals. \u201cThen he put me in a position where I couldn\u2019t say no: He just told everyone I was his manager.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is who he is, and he will never compromise. It doesn\u2019t come from a place of selfishness,\u201d he continues. \u201cKanye\u2019s the best listener I\u2019ve ever worked with. If I interrupt Kanye, every single time, he\u2019ll wait for me to finish before speaking. It\u2019s a running joke -- sometimes I interrupt him just to see. And he always goes, \u2018No, no, finish. I want to hear what you have to say.\u2019 We\u2019ll have full-on yelling fights. Kanye likes it. Kanye wants you to tell him what you think.\u201d\n\nBraun spoke more about managing West and Bieber with ET last year.
