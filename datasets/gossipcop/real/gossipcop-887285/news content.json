In that time period, do you think it\u2019s become any easier for women in the music industry to be independent, both artistically and financially?\n\nRozonda \u201cChilli\u201d Thomas: Women have more of a voice now. I think it was definitely harder before we came out and during the time that we came out. You had to fight a lot harder to make sure your voice was heard. We kicked down a lot of doors. It makes us feel really good when we hear someone like Lady Gaga thank us for paving the way for them. I definitely think that it\u2019s different and the struggle is not over, but not the same.\n\nSo much about TLC broke the girl group formula, but there are also aspects of your music that fall into the girl group history: harmonies, choreography, a sense of unity. Did you see yourself as fitting into that lineage when you were forming TLC?\n\nTionne \u201cT-Boz\u201d Watkins: I don\u2019t think we had girl groups on our minds at that time. I didn\u2019t know if I wanted to be in a group or just be an artist, period\u2026 But growing up [performing] in a band with my family, my mother and my father singing, of course I knew about the Ronettes. Patti LaBelle was one of my mom\u2019s favorite singers. The Supremes, I loved them. But honestly, it wasn\u2019t until I was put in the situation of a group that I started paying attention to the dynamics of being with girls, because I never got along with women growing up. I was like, \u201cUh oh, is this gonna be super hard for me?\u201d Then I started paying attention to groups.\n\nDid you ever sing girl group music growing up?\n\nT-Boz: Oh, yeah. [singing] \u201cWait a minute, Mister Postman!\u201d Of course. Even that song that\u2019s out now [\u201cFeel It Still\u201d by Portugal, the Man] sounds just like it and it\u2019s a major hit. When you hear something familiar to your ear that was already a hit, you don\u2019t know why you like it, you\u2019re just drawn to it. And I think that\u2019s why that single did so well, because it was a classic from the Marvelettes.\n\nWomen\u2019s self-esteem has always been a big topic for TLC, from \u201c Unpretty \u201d through your more recent song \u201c Perfect Girls .\u201d Do you have any thoughts on this now, in the age of Instagram?\n\nT-Boz: Social media has made it to where young girls are striving to be something that\u2019s not real. They have all these apps and filters where you can adjust your body shape. So I just want the younger generation to understand: None of us are perfect. We all have flaws. I just wish people would be more forthcoming about that. It cracks me up when you see somebody with a clearly fake booty; you wanna lie and say you was doing squats and you got on a push-up bra? Come on, man. Just say, \u201cI got some injections in my lips. I got cheekbones. I got a butt \u2019cause I didn\u2019t like mine being flat,\u201d and keep it moving.", "images": ["https://pitchfork.com/verso/static/pitchfork-us/assets/logo-inverted.svg",
