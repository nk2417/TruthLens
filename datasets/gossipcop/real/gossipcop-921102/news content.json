She has a history of inflammatory tweets [17][18] which either implicitly or explicitly call for violence, which has led to Drag Race distancing itself from her, including her being banned from RuPaul's DragCon LA 2018 after making a potential bomb threat [19] while she claims to be the victim.[20] Sanchez has come under renewed scrutiny in 2025 after posting widely criticised tweets mocking the passings of Drag Race UK Series 1 winner The Vivienne and Rupaul\u2019s Drag Race season 4 contestant Jiggly Caliente. Renewed calls for her disqualification were made, and RuPaul seemingly responded by tweeting a GIF from a scene in season 2 where she appears to slap Tyra.[21]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/RuPauls-Drag-Race-S2.jpg/250px-RuPauls-Drag-Race-S2.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ef/Tyra_Sanchez_%28cropped%29_2.jpg/250px-Tyra_Sanchez_%28cropped%29_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/RuPauls-Drag-Race-S2.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/20px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/RuPauls-Drag-Race-S2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul%27s_Drag_Race_season_2", "title": "RuPaul's Drag Race season 2", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/96/RuPauls-Drag-Race-S2.jpg", "width": 802, "height": 1200}, "title": "RuPaul's Drag Race season 2 - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
