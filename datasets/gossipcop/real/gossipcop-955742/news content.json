Valderrama was seen visiting Lovato again on Thursday, when a photo of him at the hospital emerged.\n\nSplashNews.com\n\nA source close to the former couple previously told PEOPLE on Tuesday that while Valderrama \u201cknew she was going through a tough time,\u201d the actor \u201cwasn\u2019t prepared for this.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe saw her through so many ups and downs and was her rock through some of her darkest moments. To see her back in such a sad and vulnerable place is heartbreaking for him,\u201d the insider continued, adding that Valderrama has \u201calways cared deeply for her and they truly remained friends after they broke up.\u201d\n\nLester Cohen/WireImage)\n\n\u201cDemi always hoped they would end up back together in the future,\u201d the source continued. \u201cHe\u2019s the love of her life and vice versa.\u201d\n\nThe singer\u2019s publicist released a statement Tuesday evening confirming Lovato \u201cis awake and with her family who want to express thanks to everyone for the love, prayers and support.\u201d\n\nThough reports have indicated the overdose was heroin-related, a source close to Lovato previously told PEOPLE that it was not.\n\nBroadimage/REX/Shutterstock\n\nA source who was formerly in the singer\u2019s inner circle told PEOPLE on Friday that Lovato\u2019s mother, Dianna De La Garza, was \u201caware\u201d of her struggles with substance abuse but felt unable to address her daughter\u2019s issues, as Lovato was financially supporting her.\n\n\u201cHer mother\u2019s a very sweet person who has zero \u2014 when I say zero, she has zero say,\u201d the insider said of De La Garza\u2019s experiences with her daughter\u2019s previous downward spiral. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with a lot of kids. All those mothers [in Hollywood], become not-mothers. They become slaves to their kids.\u201d\n\nAnother source told PEOPLE on Friday Lovato\u2019s family \u201cis pushing for rehab,\u201d adding \u201cthey have looked into several options.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Demi Lovato Not Under Criminal Investigation After Apparent Overdose: Police\n\nThe \u201cStone Cold\u201d singer has battled addiction, mental illness and an eating disorder for years. In 2010, she entered treatment, where she received professional assistance for bipolar disorder, bulimia, self-harm and addiction. She relapsed after she left the treatment center, then entered a sober living facility for a year.\n\nIn March, Lovato revealed she celebrated six years of sobriety, but three months later, in June, she released a new song, \u201cSober,\u201d in which she suggested that she had relapsed.\n\nIf you or someone you know is in need of help, please contact the SAMHSA substance abuse helpline at
