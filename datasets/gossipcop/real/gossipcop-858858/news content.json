An adventure to one of the most beautiful National Parks in Europe.\"\n\n\"Instead, I ended up in a euphoric white dream that the voices of my husband and daughter pulled me from and I ended up in a Croatian hospital being poked and prodded and wondering 'why me?' But today, I had to ask, 'why not me'? I'm human,\" she continued. \"I have an expiration date.\"\n\nTrista, who shares two children with husband Ryan Sutter (her final pick on The Bachelorette), wrote that she vows to \"be a better version of myself as a wife, mother, sister, cousin, niece, aunt, neighbor, daughter, and friend,\" and thanked her friends, members of Bachelor Nation, and the tourists and Croatians who helped her through the experience.\n\n\"Lastly, thank you to my family, especially @ryansutter. Without you, I don't know that I would be here today. You are my everything and I love you forevermore,\" she concluded. \"If you've gotten this far, know that I don't share these words for your pity, but to inspire you to take them and be thankful for your life and blessings. Tell the people you love how you feel and live with grateful enthusiasm. I plan to.\"\n\n\n\nRELATED: Trista and Ryan Sutter Share Advice for 'Bachelor' Nick Viall\n\nTrista and Ryan renewed their vows in an intimate ceremony in 2014.
