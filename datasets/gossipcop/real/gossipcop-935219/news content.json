{"url": "https://people.com/tv/why-khloe-kardashian-spent-mothers-day-alone-cleveland/", "text": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2018s decision to reconcile with Tristan Thompson after he allegedly cheated on her throughout her pregnancy hasn\u2019t gone over well with her famous family \u2014 but according to a source, the new mom has made up her mind.\n\nWhile her mother, grandmother and sisters celebrated Mother\u2019s Day in their hometown of Calabasas this weekend, Khlo\u00e9, 33, remained in Cleveland with her 1-month-old daughter True. Thompson, 27, is in Boston with the Cavaliers for the NBA playoffs but seemingly arranged for some extravagant flower arrangements, which Khlo\u00e9 showed off on social media.\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9 is determined to show that she is happy in Cleveland,\u201d a source tells PEOPLE. \u201cShe\u2019s very stubborn when it comes to her life. Her family still disagrees with her decision to stay with Tristan, but they are trying to be supportive. They wanted Khlo\u00e9 back in L.A. for Mother\u2019s Day, but she\u2019s doing her own thing.\u201d\n\nAccording to the source, Khlo\u00e9 \u201cwants to show everyone that she is making the right decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t care what anyone thinks,\u201d says the insider. \u201cShe actually seems very happy. She doesn\u2019t really talk about Tristan, she just wants to talk about True. She loves being a mom!\u201d\n\nThe source adds that so far, adapting to life with a newborn has gone \u201cvery smoothly\u201d for Khlo\u00e9.\n\n\u201cShe has help so she can leave for shorter workouts, but otherwise she spends most of her time with the baby,\u201d the source says. \u201cShe tries to rest a bit during the day, since she\u2019s feeding at night. She seems very energetic and excited to get back to a new normal.\u201d\n\nLast week, another source told PEOPLE that Khlo\u00e9\u2019s family \u201cis still not happy\u201d with Thompson and had \u201cno desire to spend Mother\u2019s Day with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9\u2019s decision to stay with Tristan has definitely caused friction,\u201d said the source. \u201cHer family hasn\u2019t visited her for weeks. It\u2019s been hard for Khlo\u00e9, but she\u2019s doing what she believes is best for her family.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kris Jenner Struggles Not to Cry as She Talks About Khlo\u00e9 Giving Birth During Cheating Scandal\n\nThus far, Khlo\u00e9\u2019s mom Kris Jenner and sister Kim Kardashian West are the only ones to have publicly addressed Thompson\u2019s cheating scandal.\n\nAppearing on the Ellen DeGeneres Show earlier this month, Jenner, 62, said the family sprung \u201cinto action with love\u201d after photos and videos of Thompson with other women surfaced online.\n\n\u201cWe all hopped on a plane and flew to Cleveland, because that\u2019s what we know to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m there to support my kids no matter what happens. I just do the best I can, just like anybody else would for their family. There\u2019s a lot of us and we all get together and we do things together and we\u2019re a force to be reckoned with.\u201d\n\nAppearing on the same talk show, Kim, 37, admitted the situation was \u201cso f\u2014ed up.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor Khlo\u00e9,\u201d she said. \u201cWe really were rooting for Khlo\u00e9. And we still are. She\u2019s so strong and she\u2019s doing the best that she can. It\u2019s a really sad situation, all over.\u201d\n\nAfter that interview, Thompson blocked Kim on social media, she revealed last week on Live with Kelly and Ryan.\n\nStill, \u201cI\u2019m always rooting for love,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m always rooting for families.\u201d", "images":
