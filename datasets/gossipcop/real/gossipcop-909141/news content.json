{"url": "https://people.com/tv/kourtney-kardashian-scott-disick-discuss-marriage/", "text": "It\u2019s summertime in Calabasas, which means new beginnings for all three of the Kardashian sisters.\n\nOn Sunday\u2019s episode of Keeping up with the Kardashians, Kim, 37, launched her KKW Beauty line, Khlo\u00e9, 33, brought her boyfriend home for the summer, and Kourtney, 38, tried to set some boundaries with Scott Disick, 34, after he wasn\u2019t invited to Khlo\u00e9\u2019s surprise birthday party.\n\nKhloe\u2019s homecoming\n\nAfter spending the majority of the basketball season with her boyfriend, Cleveland Cavaliers player Tristan Thompson, in Ohio, Khlo\u00e9, reveals to Kim and Kourtney that she and the NBA star will be spending the summer in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI love that Tristan was like, \u2018I want to be there this summer,\u2019 \u201d Khlo\u00e9 explained to her sisters. \u201cWe\u2019re always in Cleveland. He literally can\u2019t [wait to] come here and hang out with you guys. He\u2019s like, \u2018I want to be a part of your family and do stuff as a group.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Good American founder continued, \u201cHe was like, \u2018I want to be with your family more,\u2019 and he really wants to hang out with all of us more. We\u2019re going to be here, but we also want a house in the city.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 stresseed over finding a rental in Los Angeles for the pair to spend the summer so Thompson, 26, could be closer to UCLA, where he did twice-daily workouts. \u201cTrust me, nobody in L.A. wants to sit in traffic for over two hours every single day,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Revenge Body host added that she wanted to make sure Tristan was comfortable on her coast since he\u2019d done the same for herin Cleveland. \u201cTristan has always gone out of his way to make me feel at home,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in Cleveland he\u2019s gone above and beyond, so in L.A. I want to do the same for him.\u201d\n\nWithout the help from mom Kris \u2014 who was busy coordinating Khlo\u00e9\u2019s surprise birthday party with Thompson \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 ultimately decided to have Thompson live with her at her Calabasas home.\n\n\u201cAfter talking with Tristan we have come to the conclusion that I\u2019m crazy,\u201d she recounted. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I was stressing myself out when we have our beautiful home in Calabasas. All Tristan really wants is to be with me and for us to enjoy our summer together. That\u2019s really all that matters.\u201d\n\nParty time!\n\nJust as she settled on a living situation, Khlo\u00e9 got caught off guard when Thompson surprised her with a birthday party with her family and friends in L.A.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never had a surprise party ever,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 said. \u201cWe were at dinner and Tristan was so calm. He was as cool as a cucumber. He\u2019s good at surprise parties because I had no clue.\u201d\n\nThompson gave a sweet speech at the gathering and shouted out fellow basketball player Brandon Jennings, who originally set him up with Khlo\u00e9 on a blind date. \u201cI\u2019m very honored and glad to be a part of your journey,\u201d Thompson told his girlfriend in front of the attendees.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 was swept away by the touching evening he organized. \u201cTristan is just incredible,\u201d she gushed. \u201cI\u2019ve never been this happy. I am so lucky to be with someone that is so thoughtful and so sweet.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Scott Disick and Sofia Richie Get a Congratulations Dessert and Become Instagram Official\n\nNo invite for Scott\n\nBut Disick didn\u2019t feel as satisfied with the evening since he wasn\u2019t on the guest list.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even get invited to her birthday,\u201d he complained to Kim and ex Kourtney. \u201cI\u2019m family!\u201d\n\nKnowing Kourtney was the reason he didn\u2019t get to go, she offered him a weak excuse: \u201cI didn\u2019t want you to coming to the birthday and be photographed going in.\u201d\n\n\u201cPhotographed going in is your concern?\u201d Disick responded. \u201cMy concern would be \u2026 to be there for your sister who I love and cared about for the past 10-12 years and been there for through thick and thin and marriages and all these different things.\u201d\n\nKourtney had been adopting a positive outlook and later divulged to Khlo\u00e9 over a workout that she was taken aback by the confrontation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit caught off guard and I just said that I didn\u2019t want to be photographed even though that\u2019s really not what I meant,\u201d Kourtney admitted. \u201cI just try to be positive. And I didn\u2019t want to say I just didn\u2019t want you there. So if I can\u2019t say anything nice, I just won\u2019t say anything at all.\u201d\n\nWith Khlo\u00e9\u2019s advice, Kourtney came clean to the father of her three kids about the real reason why she didn\u2019t want him at the birthday affair. \u201cThere\u2019s times when I want you to come and there\u2019s times that I don\u2019t,\u201d she told Disick bluntly.\n\nDisick understood and admitted hanging out with a string of various women in Cannes prior to the party wasn\u2019t the best look. \u201cObviously I\u2019m not able to handle everything that well,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have the best support team. I can try to f\u2014ing be a better person, but it\u2019s not the simplest thing.\u201d\n\nThe conversation eventually took a lighter turn, and Disick joked, \u201cWhen do you think were gonna get married by the way, like 40?\u201d\n\nKourtney responded, \u201cYou think when I turn 40 I\u2019m gonna go, hey I\u2019ve been looking for this drunk guy and he has a bunch of dirty sh\u2014 stained underwear?\u201d\n\nKim\u2019s beautiful venture\n\nKim\u2019s stressors didn\u2019t come from the man in her life. In fact, she said husband Kanye West actually helped her plan the launch party for her KKW Beauty line.\n\n\u201cKanye saw the plans and it was so helpful his input,\u201d Kim said. \u201cHe called the florist and we made that whole flower rose room last minute, and that was honestly like the biggest attraction.\u201d\n\nKim hosted beauty bloggers and industry titans at her house to support her cosmetics line, which she had announced at the Forbes Women\u2019s Summit in June.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so exciting to do something on my own,\u201d she said. \u201cBasically for the past almost decade my sisters and I have always had a licensing deal but going from being a licensee to an owner is such a big deal and it\u2019s so much more responsibility. I feel like this has been what I\u2019ve been working for for 10 years.\u201d\n\nBut the mother of two was nervous about doing the interview with Forbes\u2019 editor-in-chief at the summit, as she was still easing into doing press after her October 2016 robbery.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been like slowly taking my time to come back and this is a serious, sit-down, major interview,\u201d Kim told Kris, 62. \u201cThis isn\u2019t \u2026 I don\u2019t know how something like this could go. If they want to ask me crazy questions, it\u2019s Steve Forbes. It\u2019s hard for me to get back out there.\u201d\n\nBut in the end \u2014 after releasing new promotional images because fans thought she was wearing blackface in the originals \u2014 Kim was happy with how the launch party turned out. \u201cThere\u2019s such amazing press on this launch party,\u201d she gushes. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so happy we made so many changes so it would be perfect.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images":
