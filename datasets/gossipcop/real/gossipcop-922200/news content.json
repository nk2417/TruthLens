I trust you a lot more than my Staten Island fashion knowledge,\" Davidson says. \"... It's so funny, I thought I was like, kind of dressing well, but it's so nice to know that I've been dressing like [bleep] the entire time.\"\n\nIn the new video posted \"SNL's\" YouTube page (check it out above), Tan pokes fun Pete's Staten Island roots and frozen-in-puberty vibe before pulling a few chic looks from the Saks racks for him to model.\n\nSo why the attempted upgrade? The 24-year-old admits he wants to dress to impress his mate Cazzie David's \"cool family.\" (Yes, her dad is Larry David of \"Seinfeld\" and \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" fame.)\n\nThree charming Pete-to-Tan revelations: He \"never, NEVER\" thinks he's sexy, he doesn't \"even have mirrors at my house 'cause I don't like my face\" and his fashion sense is a case of arrested development: \"I think like an 18-year-old kids, like -- 'those are cool!'\" when picking out clothes.\n\nAfter modeling a series of jackets and a sharp hunter green top coat, Pete quips: \"I feel like I should reshoot my intro for the show.\"", "images":
