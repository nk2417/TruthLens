That\u2019s what I would say.\u201d\n\nThings became a bit more awkward when Urban lost his ear piece while trying to show Cohen and Cooper the crowd in Nashville, where Urban was performing for the city\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve celebration, and couldn\u2019t hear the interviewers.\n\nLuckily, the interview ended on an amicable note with everyone wishing each other a happy New Year. After the call ended, Cohen realized Kidman had given him a little jab.\n\n\u201cThat was amazing. That was so cool that Nicole Kidman joined in,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cI think she just shaded me a little bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell yeah, she did. Yes,\u201d Cooper agreed.\n\n\u201cI guess she\u2019s not coming on my show,\u201d the Watch What Happens Live host concluded.\n\nCooper seemed to understand Kidman\u2019s viewpoint. In a tweet, he described her comments as \u201csome well deserved shade.\u201d\n\nThe CNN anchor then mentioned that Cohen has lots of celebrity guests on his Bravo talk show.\n\n\u201cNot Nicole Kidman,\u201d Cohen responded.", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/zach-bryan.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/boston-blue-faith-and-family-sonequa-martin-green-donnie-wahlberg-cbs.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/70afec6a-3143-4947-b047-428e525611d4.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": [".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-andy-cohen-new-years-eve/", "title": "Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban Throw Some Shade at Andy Cohen", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban Throw Some Shade at Andy Cohen", "description": "Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban threw shade all the way from Nashville to Times Square on New Year\u2019s Eve when Andy Cohen asked the couple a slightly controversial question during CNN\u2018s live broadcast.
