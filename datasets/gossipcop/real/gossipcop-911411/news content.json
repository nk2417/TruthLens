Now actor Paul Rudd can add Hasty Pudding Man of the Year to his list of accolades.\n\nRudd, who has appeared in films such as \u201cAnchorman,\u201d \u201cAnt Man,\u201d and \u201cForgetting Sarah Marshall\u201d \u2014 in which he co-starred with 2018 Woman of the Year, Mila Kunis \u2014 was honored by the Hasty Pudding Theatricals with their annual award on today. A full day of festivities on campus awaited Rudd, including a tour of the Hasty Pudding clubhouse and Harvard Yard, fine dining, and entertainment ahead of his award ceremony.\n\nThe day began at Farkas Hall, where he listened with rapt attention as students explained the history of the Hasty Pudding Club. He was then serenaded by the Radcliffe Pitches, Harvard\u2019s oldest female a cappella group.\n\n\u201cWow! That was incredible!\u201d proclaimed Rudd following their performance, a thunderstruck smile on his face.\n\nHarvard University Harvard University Image 1: The Radcliffe Pitches, including Arianna Paz \u201919, sing for Paul Rudd as he arrives at the hall.

Normally I would do this with a drill, but I didn\u2019t bring my Makita with me.\u201d\n\nThe party then moved through the Square to tour Harvard Yard. Rudd then received his Pudding Pot tonight at the closing ceremony, where he was roasted by the club members and participated in their latest show, \u201cIntermission Impossible,\u201d the company\u2019s 170th production.\n\nDaniel Hughes \u201918 (from left), Paul Daniel Hughes \u201918 (from left), Paul Rudd, and Scott Hall \u201920 joke about Rudd\u2019 skills with a screwdriver as he adds his name to the placard listing the Hasty Pudding Man of the Year honorees through the years. Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Harvard University\n\n\u201cThe whole day has been a blast,\u201d Rudd said during the press conference that followed the roast. \u201cIt\u2019s been great getting to see Harvard. I\u2019ve never been here before. It was so profound to walk through the Yard and learn about the history. I\u2019m a bit of a history buff, and to be here \u2026 was very moving.\u201d\n\nThe big question of Rudd was who he was rooting for in the Super Bowl on Sunday. Without hesitation, Rudd emphatically responded: \u201cI\u2019m rooting for the Philadelphia Eagles. The Belichick/Brady combo is the greatest ever, but I\u2019m sick of seeing the Patriots win.\u201d\n\nWhen asked which of his film characters he most identified with, Rudd said, \u201cI think my character in \u201cI Love You, Man\u201d because he had that kind of insecurity that sometimes makes you say dumb things in certain situations \u2014 [such as] you\u2019re rooting for the Eagles over the Patriots when you\u2019re in Boston.\u201d\n\nHarvard University Harvard University Image 1: Paul Rudd (center) holds the coveted Pudding Pot with Laurel McCall (left) and Corban Ryan.

Started in 1951, the Pudding Pot was given exclusively to women until 1967, when the club expanded the award to recognize men.\n\nThe Hasty Pudding award places Rudd in the company of Harrison Ford, Bill Murray, Paul Newman, and Tom Hanks, all past recipients.\n\nHasty Pudding made headlines following the Jan. 25 ceremony for Kunis when its president, Amira T. Weeks \u201918, announced that the troupe will begin casting women in its shows. The group has included women for some time, but has only had males onstage.\n\nWhen asked which of his film characters he most identified with, Rudd said, \u201cI think my character in \u201cI Love You, Man\u201d because he had that kind of insecurity that sometimes makes you say dumb things in certain situations \u2014 [such as] you\u2019re rooting for the Eagles over the Patriots when you\u2019re in Boston.\u201d Stephanie Mitchell/Harvard Staff Photographer Harvard University\n\nRudd made his acting debut in the NBC drama \u201cSisters\u201d in 1992, and broke out as the love interest in the 1995 cult comedy \u201cClueless.\u201d He would go on to star and appear in a series of successful films, from critically acclaimed cult classics such as \u201cWet Hot American Summer\u201d to big-budget blockbusters like the \u201cAvengers\u201d franchise. Along with starring as the titular character, Rudd was a co-writer on \u201cAnt Man,\u201d which grossed more than $500 million worldwide.\n\nTickets for the performance can be purchased at http://hastypudding.org/buy-tickets.
