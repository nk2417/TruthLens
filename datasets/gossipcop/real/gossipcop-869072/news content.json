The next two answers were tougher for the boys, who had to respond to what Rob\u2019s hidden talent was and what makes him laugh.\n\nThe family was on the show to promote their upcoming television series, The Lowe Files.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nup_179250_1457_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nup_179250_1457_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lorena O'Neil", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/rob-lowe-best-son-challenge-tonight-show-1024300/", "title": "Rob Lowe\u2019s Kids Play the \u201cBest Son Challenge\u201d on \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "&quot;Don't embarrass me,&quot; Rob tells his two sons.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Lorena O'Neil", "tags": "Jimmy Fallon, Late Night TV, Rob Lowe, The Tonight Show, Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Rob Lowe\u2019s Kids Play the \u201cBest Son Challenge\u201d on \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/rob-lowe-best-son-challenge-tonight-show-1024300/", "description": "\"Don't embarrass me,\" Rob tells his two sons.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nup_179250_1457_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Rob Lowe's Kids Play the \"Best Son Challenge\" on 'The Tonight Show'"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-25T13:19:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-25T14:35:56+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Don't embarrass me,\" Rob tells his two sons.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Rob Lowe\u2019s Kids Play the \u201cBest Son Challenge\u201d on \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/nup_179250_1457_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/m4_doU2vcqM"], "publish_date": 1500988792.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
