They\u2019re amazing and when they\u2019re around they are in the show but I think it\u2019s a little too early for them to have any kind of spinoff.\"\n\nKris has not publicly confirmed or commented on the news that two of her daughters -- Kylie Jenner and Khloe Kardashian -- are pregnant, but did make a sly reference to Kylie's baby news at Milan Fashion week.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, Kris said, \"It wouldn't be the family if something didn't happen every single day.\"\n\nWith all the pregnancies popping up (Kim Kardashian is also reportedly expecting a third child, a girl, via surrogate), are there any plans to stop doing the show? Not according to momager supreme Kris. She told Variety, \"I think everybody has their breaks that they need from time to time. If somebody\u2019s really had enough and they\u2019re overwhelmed or they\u2019re really crazy or they\u2019re filming, everybody still is able to take a break for a minute and it still works out.\"\n\nThe 61-year-old also revealed to Variety that even after ten years, she still loves doing the show. \"I wake up every morning and I get to work with my kids and it\u2019s a great jumping-off place for everything we do. And we love who we work with. We\u2019re still filming with some of the same people we were with on Day 1, Season 1, Episode 1, so it\u2019s like we\u2019re with our family every day.\"\n\n\"And we get to travel with each other and we get to vacation together. It\u2019s become a lifestyle for us and something that we are truly passionate about, or we wouldn\u2019t be doing it,\" she added.\n\nFor more on the Kardashian and Jenner baby news, watch the video below!", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-06/kim_kris_1280_612044826.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_KhloePregnant_092617.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/slides/167173/kris_kylie_425_479843604.jpg?h=d9f367d3&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-11/1280_kris_jenner_112116_getty624994038.jpg?h=90ed80ec&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-11/1280_kris_jenner_112116_getty624994038.jpg?h=90ed80ec", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-11/1280_kris_jenner_112116_getty624994038.jpg?h=90ed80ec", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/kris-jenner-says-its-too-early-think-about-kuwtk-spinoff-her-grandkids-88178", "title": "Kris Jenner Says It's 'Too Early' to Think About a 'KUWTK' Spinoff With Her Grandkids", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-11/1280_kris_jenner_112116_getty624994038.jpg?h=90ed80ec", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The matriarch of the Kardashian-Jenner clan dishes on the future of the reality show.", "title": "Kris Jenner Says It's 'Too Early' to Think About a 'KUWTK' Spinoff With Her Grandkids", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kris-jenner-says-its-too-early-think-about-kuwtk-spinoff-her-grandkids-88178", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The matriarch of the Kardashian-Jenner clan dishes on the future of the reality show.", "twitter": {"description": "The matriarch of the Kardashian-Jenner clan dishes on the future of the reality show.", "title": "Kris Jenner Says It's 'Too Early' to Think About a 'KUWTK' Spinoff With Her Grandkids", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kris-jenner-says-its-too-early-think-about-kuwtk-spinoff-her-grandkids-88178", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2016-11/1280_kris_jenner_112116_getty624994038.jpg?h=90ed80ec", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Kris Jenner Says It's 'Too Early' to Think About a 'KUWTK' Spinoff With Her Grandkids | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, TV, Kris Jenner", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
