She calls it \u2018Two Spirit,\u2019 which is what the Native Americans call someone who can love both man and woman,\u201d the Waitress alum continued, adding, \u201cI really like that.\u201d\n\nIn June, Mraz penned a Pride-themed poem, writing, \u201cI am bi your side,\u201d a line that the star had included but \u201cdidn\u2019t realize was going to be so telling,\u201d he said to Billboard.\n\nJimmy Fontaine\n\n\u201cTwo Spirit\u201d was coined in the early 1990\u2019s at a conference for gay and lesbian Native Americans as an umbrella term with no specific description of gender or sexual orientation, according to the New York Times.\n\nThis is not the first time Mraz has opened up about his sexuality.\n\nIn a 2005 interview with Genre magazine, he said he was \u201cbisexually open-minded,\u201d telling the publication, \u201cI have never been in a sexual relationship with a man. If the right one came along, then sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a gay friend I was hanging out with just about every day. We were basically best friends. It took me about three months before I realized, \u2018Oh my god, we\u2019re dating,\u2019 \u201d he shared. \u201cRight before I moved to California he gave me a pretty strong-willed kiss goodbye, which I have never experienced before. Unfortunately, he had a little bit more facial hair than I like.\u201d\n\nMraz\u2019s first album in four years, titled Know., is set for an Aug. 10 release.", "images":
