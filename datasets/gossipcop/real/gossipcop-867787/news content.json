Upon seeing Tyler perform, Jenner said she was compelled to go backstage, say hello, and tell the musician how much one of his songs had meant to her.\n\nAfter telling Kimmel that before she publicly came out as a trans woman in 2015, her life was full of \u201csecrets\u201d and \u201chiding,\u201d she recalled her conversation with Tyler:\n\n\u201cI said to Steven, \u2018I have had some really, really tough times in my life. ... Every once in a while I would ... sneak out in the dark and drive around. And I always used to take your song, \u2018Dude (Looks Like a Lady)\u2019.\u201d\n\nJenner further explained to Kimmel that \u201cDude (Looks Like a Lady)\u201d became something of a personal anthem for her, \u201cdriving around in my little car with my little CD in there, whippin\u2019 up the tunes and stuff. ... It made me feel good.\u201d\n\nBut not every member of the LGBTQ community feels so warmly about the song.\n\nOriginally released in 1987, \u201cDude (Looks Like a Lady)\u201d spent 20 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It also experienced a second wind in 1993, after it was included on the soundtrack for the Robin Williams cross-dressing comedy Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\nHowever, despite the song\u2019s mainstream success, Aerosmith has frequently been criticized for the lyrics and music video\u2019s offensive insinuations about trans women.\n\nIn general, the lyrics blur the lines between being a trans woman, a cross-dressing man, or a man who simply has \u201cfeminine\u201d traits. The song also plays on the idea that trans women intentionally deceive men or are \u201cin disguise,\u201d that they are unattractive or repulsive (as evidenced in one of the video\u2019s first scenes where Steven Tyler recoils at the sight of a construction worker whose gender identity is purposely unclear), and at one point mixes pronouns, going from \u201cOh she like it\u201d in one line to \u201cOh, he was a lady,\u201d in the next.\n\nGiven the song\u2019s backstory, the fact that it offends many people is hardly surprising.\n\nIn an 2012 interview with SongFacts, songwriter Desmond Child, who worked with Aerosmith on the contentious track, reveals that the song was based on Tyler\u2019s experience of once mistaking M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce vocalist Vince Neil for a woman at a bar. After realizing who he was, Tyler and his fellow band members joked about how the \u201cdude looked like a lady.\u201d\n\nDesmond goes on to share that he talked Aerosmith into the song\u2019s story concept of \u201ca guy that walks into a strip joint and falls in love with the stripper on stage, goes backstage and finds out it\u2019s a guy.\u201d Though Desmond argues that \u201cDude (Looks Like a Lady\u201d is \u201ca very accepting song,\u201d many people take issue with the reading that the trans woman stripper is \u201ctricking\u201d her customers, not to mention the suggestion that a trans woman is actually a man.\n\nTrans women have long been subject to harmful misconceptions of this nature. As a result, they experience \u201cdisproportionate violence and discrimination at the hands of both strangers and intimate partners,\u201d according to the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nThough a representative of Jenner\u2019s told HuffPost that there are currently no actual plans for Jenner and Tyler to record a duet, the song\u2019s history and Jenner\u2019s comment are still igniting heavy pushback from the LGBTQ community.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t keep doing things that perpetuate the false idea that trans women are actually men,\u201d one Reddit user wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s making things more dangerous for every one of us that isn\u2019t protected by having a bajillion dollars and being a public figure.\u201d\n\nOn Twitter, people have called Jenner\u2019s comments \u201cirresponsible.\u201d", "images":
