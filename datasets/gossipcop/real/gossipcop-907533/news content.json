Few hip-hop feuds are as bitter as this rivalry between Queens music legends, which has spanned nearly two decades, powered by savage diss tracks, spiteful interviews that stoked the fires, social media bashing and physical altercations.\n\nPrior to becoming one of hip-hop's biggest success stories with his debut album Get Rich or Die Tryin', 50 Cent was an up-and-coming rapper looking to make his way in the game. He quickly became known for calling rappers out by name on songs like his infamous 1999 single \"How to Rob,\" which included jabs at heavyweights like JAY-Z, Ma$e, DMX and Big Pun. While 50 Cent was considered a buzzworthy prospect, at the time, he was a relative unknown in comparison to Ja Rule, who's own debut album, Venni Vetti Vecci, was certified platinum off the strength of the lead single \"Holla Holla,\" making him one of New York City's leaders of the new school.\n\nAlthough the circumstances are murky, somewhere along the line, the two artists bumped heads, resulting in 50 Cent throwing down the gauntlet and waging war with Ja Rule and Murder Inc. as a staff, record label and as a crew. What ensued was one of hip-hop's longest-lasting, most-heated beefs\u2014a conflict that's still simmering to this day.\n\nWith the battle between the two artists having heated back up, XXL looks back on the history of the beef from its onset, compiling the key run-ins, diss tracks, interviews and clashes that have added to this age-old clash.", "images": ["http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/09/attachment-tech-n9ne-4.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/09/attachment-nba-youngboy-kendrick-lamar-tour.jpg?w=980&q=75", "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2018/01/ja-rule-50-cent-beef.jpeg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/08/attachment-monaleo-photo-11.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/09/attachment-molly-santana-1.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/09/attachment-fredo-bang-3.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/09/attachment-100k-track.jpg?w=980&q=75", "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2018/01/ja-rule-50-cent-beef.jpeg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/09/attachment-sailorr.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2024/01/attachment-nicki-minaj-drake-kendrick-lamar.jpg?w=980&q=75", "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2017/10/xxl-trimmed-spacing.png", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/09/attachment-ghostface-killah-5.jpg?w=980&q=75"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2018/01/ja-rule-50-cent-beef.jpeg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.xxlmag.com/50-cent-ja-rule-beef-complete-timeline/", "title": "A Complete Timeline of 50 Cent and Ja Rule\u2019s Beef", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "xxl", "description": "After nearly 20 years, 50 Cent and Ja Rule are still bickering.
