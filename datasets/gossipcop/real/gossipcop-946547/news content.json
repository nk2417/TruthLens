{"url": "https://www.byrdie.com/makeup-with-spf", "text": "It's important to shield your skin from the sun, and finding foundations with SPF makes it easier to do so. Still, there's one big caveat: The majority of foundations with SPF don't go much higher than SPF 25, which is below the recommended SPF 30 for daily use. So, your best bet is to keep using a separate face sunscreen and consider the protection you're getting from your foundation as an extra insurance policy. After all, the more SPF, the better.\n\nTo find the best foundations with SPF, we conducted extensive research, consulted with experts, and got our editor's recommendations. We evaluated each foundation based on its formula, application, wear, and shade range, and ahead, we're sharing our favorites with you.\n\nWhat We Like Lightweight formula\n\nBuildable coverage\n\nNatural finish\n\nLong-wearing What to Consider Subtle scent\n\nCoverage: Full | Shade Range: 30 | Finish: Radiant natural | Size: 1 oz | Cruelty-Free: No\n\nThe fact that this formula contains SPF 27 is just one of the things we love about it. In addition to providing sun protection, it features a lightweight, smooth formula that's easy to blend, provides excellent coverage while still looking natural, and wears all day with almost no visible fading or breaking up. The finish is a really natural radiant, meaning it works even for those with oily skin. Byrdie writer Alyssa Kaplan says it looks almost perfect on her combination oily skin after a full day of wear. If you're looking for a foundation with SPF that can take you from work to a night out, this is the one for you.\n\nWhat We Like Affordable\n\nLong-lasting\n\nDoesn't settle into fine lines What to Consider Can oxidize\n\nCoverage: Medium to full | Shade Range: 44 | Finish: Matte | Size: 1 oz | Cruelty-Free: No\n\nA long-wearing formula? Check. (We're talking about an awe-inspiring 24-hour wear time, by the way.) A matte finish that minimizes shine without looking chalky? Yep. A wide range of 44 shades? You bet. A very wallet-friendly price tag? Indeed. This drugstore staple meets all the exact requirements of its much pricier counterparts. It's a top pick for makeup artist and beauty expert Nick Stenson, who also lauds the buildable coverage.\n\nWhat We Like Affordable\n\nLong-lasting\n\nWaterproof What to Consider Can settle into fine lines\n\nCoverage: Medium to full | Shade Range: 40 | Finish: Natural | Size: 1 oz | Cruelty-Free: No\n\nAnother great wallet-friendly pick, Stenson raves about the comfortable, breathable wear of this base, no small feat given its impressive staying power. To that point, it's not only waterproof but also transfer- and sweat-resistant, too. The coverage is on the medium to full side, though easily buildable, and no matter how long you wear it, the color always stays true and never changes.\n\nWhat We Like Full coverage yet lightweight\n\nA little goes a long way\n\nSuper smooth-looking on skin What to Consider Could be more long-wearing\n\nCoverage: Full | Shade Range: 27 | Finish: Natural velvet matte | Size: 1 oz | Cruelty-Free: No\n\nFor days or occasions when you want a foundation that really packs on the coverage, this cult favorite can't be beaten. As a general rule, full coverage almost always means a heavier texture, but that's not the case with this base. Credit the saturated yet ultrafine pigments, which deliver an intense dose of color without feeling thick. It's also why a little goes a long way (try applying it with a makeup sponge or brush for the best spreadability and most even coverage), so one bottle will last quite a while.\n\nWhat We Like Lightweight\n\nHydrating\n\nSkin improving ingredients What to Consider Has a bit of a funny smell\n\nCoverage: Sheer | Shade Range: 30 | Finish: Luminous | Size: 1 oz | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nWhen you don't want to wear a full face of foundation but still want a little something-something, look to the subtle coverage of this multitasker, a favorite among Byrdie editors. The aptly named formula acts as a serum, infused with skin-loving ingredients such as squalane, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid, and delivers a hefty dose of mineral-based SPF. And while the coverage is undoubtedly light and dewy, it's definitely more than other tinted sunscreens we've tried.\n\nCredit: Real Simple\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat We Like Lightweight powder\n\nMultipurpose product\n\nSafe for sensitive skin What to Consider Can settle into fine lines\n\nCoverage: Medium | Shade Range: 26 | Finish: Natural | Size: 0.28 oz | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\n\"This is an amazing pressed, mineral powder with buildable coverage,\" says Stenson of another one of his recommendations. \"Use it alone or to set your liquid foundation and give it a velvety smooth finish.\" Also nice: The SPF here is mineral-based, from titanium dioxide, an excellent choice for those with sensitive skin who may find chemical sunscreen ingredients irritating.\n\n\n\nWhat We Like Blurs skin imperfections\n\nLightweight\n\nProvides antioxidant protection What to Consider Shade range could be more extensive\n\nCoverage: Buildable | Shade Range: 16 | Finish: Radiant natural | Size: 1.9 oz | Cruelty-Free: No\n\nOkay, so yes, technically not a foundation, but if you're anything like us, you likely often use a tinted moisturizer exactly like you would a foundation, so we thought this was worthy of an appearance on our list. Not only does it safeguard your skin with SPF 30, but it also contains antioxidant vitamin C, and it delivers, in our humble opinion, just the right amount of natural-looking coverage.\n\nWhat We Like Easy to apply and portable\n\nProvides antioxidant protection\n\nLong-lasting What to Consider Reviewers note stick may break easily\n\nCoverage: Full | Shade Range: 24 | Finish: Velvet | Size: 0.5 oz | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nStick foundations are crazy easy to apply and can also pull double (even triple) duty, acting as a concealer and contour color, too. This is one of the few sticks we've seen that includes SPF, as well as protective antioxidants. The long-wearing pigment feels nice and smooth on the skin because it is a cream-based foundation. Plus, the range of shades includes lots of options for those with darker complexions.\n\nWhat We Like High SPF\n\nDoesn't settle into fine lines\n\nDeveloped with plastic surgeons What to Consider Not as long-lasting as other options\n\nCoverage: Full | Shade Range: 12 | Finish: Radiant natural | Size: 1 oz | Cruelty-Free: Yes\n\nAs we said, it's tricky to find a foundation with an SPF 30\u2014so those with SPF 50 are true makeup unicorns. Byrdie Editorial Director Holly Rhue loves this foundation unicorn, a creamy, full-coverage pick with other unique features besides just the high SPF. For one, it has a proprietary 3D Skin Flex Technology that ensures the color pigments \"float\" on top of the skin, rather than settling into lines or pores. It also contains diamond powder to leave skin looking radiant in the most natural way possible.\n\nWhat We Like Absorbs oil\n\nLong-lasting formula What to Consider Can settle into fine lines\n\nCoverage: Full | Shade Range: 23 | Finish: Natural matte | Size: 1.7 oz | Cruelty-Free: Yes | Byrdie Clean: No\n\nYep, the brand also has a superb option for oily skin. Stenson loves it because the namesake ingredient helps balance your complexion, and the matte, oil-absorbing formula doesn\u2019t hurt either. He adds that it\u2019s also long-wearing, super easy to apply, and is \u201ccake-free.\u201d\n\nWhat We Like Doesn't settle into fine lines\n\nPump bottle\n\nNoncomedogenic What to Consider Bottle can leak\n\nCoverage: Medium to full | Shade Range: 25 | Finish: Luminous | Size: 1 oz | Cruelty-Free: No\n\nFor an instant youth boost, reach for this liquid formula. Think of its unique Micro-Lift technology like a bra for your face, where extra-fine waxes help instantly shape and lift. Since foundation settling into fine lines can also be a concern for those with mature skin, this contains microscopic bubbles that create air pockets, letting your skin breathe and preventing the makeup from creasing and settling into any imperfections, notes Stenson, who is a fan. And since sunscreen is of the utmost importance in any anti-aging arsenal, we're happy to report that this one touts SPF 27.\n\n\n\nWhat to Look for in a Foundation With SPF\n\nFormula: \"SPF foundations are offered in all different varieties, from powders to liquids to creams, meaning you can get the consistency and coverage you are looking for,\" says Stenson. \"If you feel passionate about your coverage or consistency, start by narrowing your search there.\"\n\n\"SPF foundations are offered in all different varieties, from powders to liquids to creams, meaning you can get the consistency and coverage you are looking for,\" says Stenson. \"If you feel passionate about your coverage or consistency, start by narrowing your search there.\" SPF Level: The SPF levels in the foundation can range from 10 to over 50+, so again, if you feel strongly about a particular SPF level, start your search there. Also worth noting: SPF may not always be in the name of the product, so make sure to check the ingredient label as well, says Stenson.\n\nThe SPF levels in the foundation can range from 10 to over 50+, so again, if you feel strongly about a particular SPF level, start your search there. Also worth noting: SPF may not always be in the name of the product, so make sure to check the ingredient label as well, says Stenson. Shade Range: As with any foundation, an SPF foundation should match your skin tone. Look for a brand that comes in a wide range of shades for every skin tone and undertone. Some stores offer testers or color matching to help you make the best choice.\n\n\n\nFAQ Is SPF in foundation effective? SPF in foundation effectively blocks UVB rays but may not be effective enough to provide adequate protection overall. It's recommended that an SPF of at least 30 be used daily. Most foundations contain SPF 15 and layering the product over sunscreen enhances the sun protection factor. Keep in mind that in addition to foundation, other SPF makeup products can offer extra protection.\n\nMeet Our Expert\n\nFor this article, Team Byrdie interviewed the following for extra insights on foundations with SPF:\n\nNick Stenson is a beauty expert, licensed hairstylist, esthetician, and makeup artist, He's also the founder of Curious Brushes.\n\nWhy Trust Byrdie\n\nByrdie contributor Melanie Rud has over a decade of experience in the beauty industry, writing for some of the biggest magazines and websites out there.
