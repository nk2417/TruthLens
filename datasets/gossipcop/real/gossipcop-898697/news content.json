I don't have a vast amount of talent compared to other people.\n\n'I think talent is like 30% of it and persistence, drive and self belief are the other ones, which I guess are all the same thing.'\n\nSpecial moment: The hitmaker looked sharp in a morning suit and shiny black shoes\n\nJoking about his meeting with Charles, the musician said the Prince was impressed by his globe-trotting activities as he was due to fly to New York later for a gig.\n\nSheeran said about their brief chat: 'He was asking me if I was still selling lots of records and I told him I've got a concert in New York tomorrow, and he was quite surprised I was flying after this.'\n\nHe added: 'My grandfather was a massive royalist. He had all the commemorative plates and stuff, and he died on this day four years ago, so it's actually quite a nice full circle thing. I guess he'd be pretty proud.'\n\nPutting his hat in the ring: Ed said he would like to perform for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at their May 2018 wedding\n\nCharming: Prince Harry (right) is the second son of Prince Charles (centre, with first son Prince William, left)\n\nThe singer-songwriter's career took off after the release of his debut CD in 2011 and since that time the 26-year-old musician has notched up three number one singles, along with three chart topping albums.\n\nEd received the MBE (Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) for his services to music.\n\nAn MBE is given for an outstanding achievement or service to the community, which has had a long-term, significant impact and stand out as an example to others.\n\nEd won an Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year in 2015, having previously penned the hits Love Yourself and Cold Water for Justin Bieber.\n\nModest: Ed was modest about his achievements, saying he owed his success to persistence\n\nRecognised: Ed has had three chart-topping albums in six years\n\nDelighted: He will fly to New York tonight for a concert in the city\n\nHe was the brains behind Little Things, a hit for One Direction, and Olly Murs' Love Shine Down, as well as working with Eminem, The Weeknd and Jessie Ware.\n\nEd collaborated with his good friend Taylor Swift, with whom he toured for the majority of 2013. They worked together on Everything Has Changed in 2012 from her album Red.\n\nWho else has breached protocol? Ed Sheeran is far from being the first person to fall foul of the arcane traditions governing commoners and royalty. Back in July, Canadian Governor-General David Johnston momentarily broke the protocol as he touched the Queen on the arm during a royal visit to Canada House. The 76-year-old dignitary gently aided the monarch as she made her way down the red-carpeted steps of the historic building in Trafalgar Square. Michelle Obama also embraced the Queen during a US presidential visit to the UK in 2009, swiftly creating the day's newspaper headlines. The sight of the Queen publicly hugging another woman astonished other guests. An onlooker said: 'It was a pretty simultaneous gesture. We couldn't believe what we were seeing.' And the Australians have a terrible track record, with former Prime Minister Paul Keating dubbed 'the Lizard of Oz' when he put his arm around the Queen in 1992. In 2014, basketball star LeBron James put his arm around the Kate Middleton's shoulder - still a breach in etiquette, even though he is known as King James. The eyebrow-raising moment followed the royal couple meeting pop royalty Beyonc\u00e9 and husband Jay-Z - and Prince William visiting the White House for a meeting with President Barack Obama. Advertisement\n\nIn 2016, Ed went on to win the Song Of The Year and Best Pop Solo Performance (both for Thinking Out Loud) trophies at the Grammys and has been nominated a further 10 times in various categories.\n\nEd's three albums - Plus (2011), Multiply (2014) and Divide (2017) - have all peaked at No1 in the UK Album Chart.\n\nSpecial recognition: Ed has an Ivor Novello, two Grammys and three BRIT Awards to his name\n\n'I don't have a vast amount of talent': Ed (performing here at Glastonbury 2017) was humble about his achievements\n\nHe's come a long way: Ed (here in 2012) has come a long way since his debut in 2011\n\nBig performances: Some of his biggest performances, included singing at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in 2014, in London\n\nSpecial guest: Ed was a guest at Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee Concert in 2012, here with Kylie Minogue (right)\n\nThe original, debut album - released six years ago - has now gone seven-times platinum in the UK.\n\nEd made chart-topping history earlier this year when he held nine out of the 10 top spots in the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIt followed a break from the music industry in which the world-famous musician went travelling and spent time doing charity work.\n\nSome of his most notable performances include singing at the annual Victoria's Secret Fashion Show in London in 2014, but this year he also had the honour of headlining Glastonbury Music Festival 2017.\n\nFriends in high places: Ed is close friends with US artist Taylor Swift, even appearing on her album Red\n\nCollaborating: In 2013, Ed toured with Taylor and appeared on her track Everything Has Changed (here in 2014 together)\n\nBig names: He's worked with some of the biggest names in the industry, including Eminem, The Weeknd and One Direction (here performing with Beyonce)", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/20/07/104035469-0-image-a-6_1763624905623.jpg",
