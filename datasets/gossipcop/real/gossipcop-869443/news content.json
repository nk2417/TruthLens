Jolie got the early jump P.R.-wise. But Pitt won hearts and minds with the mea culpa in GQ Style. The two are still negotiating the terms of their divorce.\n\nAs for Jolie, a life already bursting at the seams\u2014with acting, directing, humanitarian work, parenting six kids, and guest-lecturing on women\u2019s rights at the London School of Economics\u2014just got exponentially bigger and more complicated, because she\u2019s now doing it alone. There\u2019s the chaos surrounding the practical day-to-day\u2014playdates, doctors\u2019 appointments, packing and unpacking, and organizing mealtimes. And there\u2019s the deeper, emotional chaos. \u201cIt\u2019s just been the hardest time, and we\u2019re just kind of coming up for air. [This house] is a big jump forward for us, and we\u2019re all trying to do our best to heal our family.\u201d\n\nAs it happens, the personal trauma has coincided with her most personal film yet. Jolie has directed a moving, large-scale adaptation of First They Killed My Father, Loung Ung\u2019s 2000 memoir of the Khmer Rouge genocide, in which Ung\u2019s parents and two of her siblings perished, along with an estimated two million other Cambodians, a quarter of the country\u2019s population. Shot entirely in Cambodia, and in the Khmer language, the film, a Netflix original, is the largest production the country has witnessed since the war, and according to the reports of several Cambodians who\u2019ve seen it, it\u2019s one of the most revelatory pieces of art about that chapter in the country\u2019s history, a history that\u2019s still difficult for Cambodians to discuss. But if Cambodians consider the film to be something of a gift, then it\u2019s surely a thank-you gift. For Jolie, Cambodia is where she started her family, and it\u2019s where she made a cathartic personal transformation, becoming the woman she is today.\n\nRecall, if you can, the Angelina of the late 90s, the era of Angie Peak Crazy. Specializing in dark volatile characters that seemed extensions of her wild-child restless self, Jolie won three Golden Globes for her roles in television movies and a best- supporting-actress Oscar for her portrayal of a young woman with apparent borderline personality disorder in Girl, Interrupted. She talked freely about having dabbled in heroin and self-cutting, and her love of knives. She and new husband Billy Bob Thornton wore each other\u2019s dried blood in pendants around their necks, and publicly bragged about their wild sex. At the 2000 Oscar ceremony, she talked provocatively about being \u201cso in love . . . right now\u201d with her brother, James, and kissed him with unsettling intimacy. To be sure, Jolie had legitimate pain in her early life\u2014her father, actor Jon Voight, had been unfaithful to her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, and the two split up early on. But it was First World pain. Being Hollywood\u2019s newest \u201cIt girl\u201d landed Jolie the title role in Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, based on a popular video game. As it happened, the movie, an example of Hollywood\u2019s most vacuous, commercial, shoot-\u2019em-up instincts, was filmed on location in Cambodia. There, Jolie, who\u2019d grown up in privileged bubbles in Los Angeles and New York, witnessed what real suffering looked like: poverty, the loss of limbs from land mines, a generation of relatives wiped out. In this world there was no room for free-floating malaise or self-indulgent antics. And in spite of their profound trials, \u201cI found a people who were so kind and warm and open, and, yes, very complex,\u201d recalls Jolie. \u201cYou drive around here you can see a lot of people with many things, but not often expressing happiness. You go there, and you see the families come out with their blanket and their picnic to watch a sunset.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6901590b82f816fa8547858d/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978ba1d7c67a060584ba972/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss09.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e36cac48e51f42566b391/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978bb411bd71e4b33f103c2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-angelina-jolie-0917-Vf-cover.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e19b5f53c646c2dea5c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss07.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69161589683a0692afe31872/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e461bd71e4b33f10349/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-opener.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e1790225743bcad6788/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss02.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e18fe060e64db80eb3f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-0917-Vf-cover.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/596e1c4c7c67a060584ba7ea/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/t-cover-angelina-jolie-vf-1214.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e19b5f53c646c2dea5e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss08.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e6d7c67a060584ba8f8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690ba383ec5ef29213749186/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6901026c7b6db29214cd9d68/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690b9ba3d0d7aa0f3c9fb7e4/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e12eca31582bb6e461be9/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58d972d8993c7e7c827eb7ef/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-interview-about-future.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/597667f81bd71e4b33f10351/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/a-angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss03.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e18b5f53c646c2dea5a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss05.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/67941a999901cb5c9371c49d/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690a5ee0da787343f1849201/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690ba04e625f5a8c4860326f/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59764e181bd71e4b33f10347/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/angelina-jolie-vf-0917-cover-ss04.png"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5978bb411bd71e4b33f103c2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-angelina-jolie-0917-Vf-cover.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evgenia Peretz", "Mert Alas", "Marcus Piggott", "Jessica Diehl"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/07/angelina-jolie-cover-story", "title": "Angelina Jolie\u2019s Vanity Fair Cover Story", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Evgenia Peretz", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "There\u2019s the Angelina Jolie who\u2019s now a single mother\u2014managing the day-to-day chaos of six kids, and the trauma of her split from Brad Pitt\u2014and there\u2019s the Angelina Jolie whose latest movie, a groundbreaking Netflix original about Cambodia\u2019s genocide, is also a thank-you to the nation that transformed her.
