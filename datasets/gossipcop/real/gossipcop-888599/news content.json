One Direction is on the heels of splitting after five years together, Us Weekly can exclusively reveal \u2014 look back at their biggest career highlights!\n\nThe incident, which was captured on camera by some audience members, happened when the former One Direction singer was singing his hit \u201cKiwi\u201d at the Hollywood Bowl during the We Can Survive concert to benefit breast cancer awareness.\n\nAs he got down on his knees near the front of the stage, a fan grabbed at his crotch. Styles appeared briefly disturbed by it and quickly swatted away the person\u2019s hand, continuing his performance, but a moment later as he headed back towards the opposite edge of the stage, he covered his groin with his hand, clearly not willing to get grabbed for a second time.\n\nWTF!!! When your favorite artist is close to you, this does not justify you touching him in this way. #RespectHarry pic.twitter.com/0PdUGR6nN2 \u2014 \u064b (@___VXXIIS) October 22, 2017\n\n\u201cYou can tell it freaked him out a little because as he continued performing, he avoided the section that fan was standing in,\u201d an eyewitness told Yahoo Celebrity UK.\n\nThe hashtag #RespectHarry quickly trended on Twitter after the encounter, with fans taking to social media to express their opinions and condemn the phantom groper.\n\nRelated: One Direction\u2019s Craziest Antics These lads know how to cause a scene!

Treat ALL people with kindness AND respect,\u201d one wrote.\n\n\u201cThis is a prime example that men are not the only ones that touch women without permission! Women also sexually assault,\u201d another person tweeted.\n\n\u201cIf you grab someone\u2019s dick without their consent, it\u2019s sexual assault,\u201d one fan commented. \u201cJust because Harry\u2019s a male doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t have the same right as women. You must be absolutely disgusting if you think him kneeling in front of you calls for that. I\u2019m disgusted.\u201d\n\nRelated: Hot Brits! Royals, movie and pop stars, oh my!
