The actress has been quietly dating New York financier Andrew Youmans, and though they\u2019ve yet to make an official public appearance together, it\u2019s the real deal. In fact, multiple sources reveal in the new issue of Us Weekly that the pair are engaged!\n\nRelated: Celebrity Couples and How They First Met Star-crossed lovers!

Whether it was through mutual friends or at work, check out their love story beginnings here!\n\n\u201cShe wants a good guy and a stable family life,\u201d says the insider.\n\nThe All the Money in the World star set off engagement speculation when she showed up at the Golden Globes on January 7 with a heart-shaped diamond ring on that finger. At the time, she brushed off the accessory as simply \u201cbeautiful jewelry.\u201d\n\nWilliams, 37, also sported the ring while wearing a red one-piece and floppy straw hat at the beach in the Bahamas, where she spent New Year\u2019s Day with Youmans and Matilda, her 12-year-old daughter with the late Heath Ledger.\n\nNotoriously private about her personal life following Ledger\u2019s tragic death from an accidental overdose nearly 10 years ago on January 22, 2008, the Montana-native has not commented publicly on her relationship with the Harvard Business School alum, 50. The pair were first spotted together in July in Rome, where she was filming the Golden Globe nominated Money. Williams beamed as they strolled down the street hand-in-hand, stopping occasionally to kiss and sample local food.\n\nRelated: Stars Gone Too Soon Us Weekly looks back at the stars who died before their time, including Amy Winehouse, Prince and Whitney Houston \u2014 see the most shocking celeb deaths\n\nWhen Ledger died at age 28 a few weeks after he and Williams broke up, Matilda was just 2. Following the tragedy, friends say the Brooklyn-based actress was hesitant to date again. \u201cMichelle was totally focused on giving Matilda the best upbringing possible,\u201d says pal. Besides, says another, \u201cIt took her a long time to get over Heath.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Williams has had a few low-key relationships, including with director Spike Jonze, actor Jason Segel and, most recently, author Jonathan Safran Foer. But her most enduring relationship is with her best friend and frequent awards show date, actress Busy Philipps, who Williams has referred to as \u201cthe love of my life.\u201d\n\nRelated: Michelle
