The 63-year-old inmate had served more than 21 years for nonviolent charges related to drug possession and money-laundering.\n\nKardashian West learned about Johnson\u2019s story last year and declared it as \u201cso unfair\u201d in a tweet to her 60 million followers. The reality television superstar then decided to take up her case.\n\n\u201cBecause I knew that I had the resources to do that. It became this mission that I just didn't want to give up,\u201d she told TODAY\u2019s Hoda Kotb.\n\n\u201cI mean, I think to some people it might seem like, \u2018Okay, Kim made a phone call to the president, showed up.\u2019 We had been in talks and working on this for seven months. And it wasn't an instant thing. It was a lot of work.\"\n\nKim Kardashian West and Alice Johnson embrace after recalling the journey that led to Johnson's commutation from a life sentence in prison. Nathan Congleton/TODAY\n\nJohnson admitted that she had no idea who Kardashian West was when she first learned the television star had started championing her cause.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I found out who she was, I started getting every magazine I could find,\u201d she said. \u201cI started reading everything that I could about her. And everyone was amazed. And I was amazed, too.\u201d\n\nA call to Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and adviser, eventually led to a May 30 Oval Office meeting where Kardashian West pleaded for clemency on behalf of Johnson. A week later, President Trump commuted Johnson\u2019s life sentence.\n\nGreat meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing. pic.twitter.com/uOy4UJ41JF \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 30, 2018\n\n\u201cMs. Johnson has accepted responsibility for her past behavior and has been a model prisoner over the past two decades,\" the White House said in a statement.\n\nKardshian West was the one who broke the news to Johnson in a phone call, telling her, \u201cYou can go home now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen she said that, I went into full-fledged Pentecostal holy dance,\u201d Johnson recalled. \u201cI started screaming and jumping.\u201d\n\nKardashian West said she can imagine herself continuing to work on behalf of others with stories similar to Johnson's.\n\n\"People have been asking me are you getting into politics? Like no. I'm still doing me. But I enjoy this,\" she said. \"This has fulfilled my heart and so since I feel so fulfilled, why would I stop that?\"\n\nJohnson said she not only feels grateful to Kardashian West but protective of her. She keeps a photo of the reality star and her husband, Kanye West, in her bible.\n\nJohnson keeps a photo of Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West inside her bible. Nathan Congleton/TODAY\n\n\u201cRight now, my prayer of focus for you was in Psalm 105. \u2018Touch not my anointed and do my prophet no harm,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cKim has been anointed to do this. And no one better not touch her \u2014 even with their mouth.\u201d\n\nJohnson said she plans to thank Kardashian West, and President Trump, by setting an example through the way she will live the rest of her life.\n\n\"'Thank you' is not big enough. I think I have to walk it out. I have to walk my 'thank you' out. I have to live it out for her, for my family, for the supporters,\" she said.\n\nJohnson also plans to speak out on behalf of other nonviolent, first-time offenders.\n\n\"I plan on continuing to magnify this issue. And I can't stop. I can't stop. I've lived it,\" she said. \"I've walked with them. I have cried with them. My life is completely intertwined forever with those who were left behind. So it can't end here.\"", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787173/web-discovery-shopping-mc-211012.jpg",
