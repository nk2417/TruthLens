Click here to get those and more in the PEOPLE Babies newsletter\n\nFiring off a list of the most significant ways her body has changed, Jenner remarked, \u201cMy boobs are defiantly three times the size, which bothers me. I have stretch marks on my boobs. My stomach isn\u2019t the same, my waist isn\u2019t the same, my butt\u2019s bigger, my thighs [are] bigger.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd honestly, I\u2019m finding I have to change my style a little because nothing in my closet fits me from before,\u201d she continued.\n\nAfter previously announcing in the video that she had \u201cplanned my first workout on Monday,\u201d the Kylie Cosmetics mogul added, \u201cI really want to get my core back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like I have fake abs now, it\u2019s just like, genetics. But I want real abs. I know I can have a super fit body. And just for my health \u2014 I want to do this. I want to feel good,\u201d she explained.\n\nKylie Jenner/Instagram\n\nBut even though watching her body \u201cgo through such a change\u201d at her age was \u201cphysically, mentally, and emotionally a challenge,\u201d Jenner added that it was \u201calso a beautiful thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was such a great pregnancy and birth. And I\u2019m so happy. I would have done the same thing over again,\u201d Jenner said.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: New Mom Kylie Jenner Flaunts Curves in Sexy \u2018Hump Day\u2019 Photo\n\nThe star gave fans a first glimpse at her post-baby transformation just seven weeks after giving birth to her daughter, posting a quick video on Snapchat of herself wearing a lifted-up black hoodie that exposed her stomach.\n\nAbout one month later, Jenner was already back in a bikini \u2014 and since then she\u2019s often showed off her toned post-baby physique on social media.\n\nKylie Jenner/Instagram\n\nIn March, Jenner revealed that she gained a total of 40 lbs. during pregnancy in a now-deleted tweet during a Q&A session with fans and followers.\n\nSources previously told PEOPLE that Jenner is determined to get back into pre-pregnancy shape because she wants to be a \u201creally hot young mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cKylie is already starting to work out,\u201d an insider said. \u201cShe\u2019s focusing on getting her body back and also getting back to a comfortable weight aside from caring for Stormi,\u201d adding that she \u201cwasn\u2019t the most comfortable while pregnant.\u201d", "images":
