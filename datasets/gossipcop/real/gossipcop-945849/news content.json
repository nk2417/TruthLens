Even before she'd been given her new title of Duchess of Sussex, her polished sense of style was lauded world over and her every move copied and analysed by fashion and beauty experts.\n\nRelated Story Why people think Meghan's hair is a pregnancy hint\n\nNo more so than her hair, nail colour, love of boat-neck dresses and, most importantly, her lip colour... (seen her in her engagement photo with Prince Harry)\n\nGetty Images\n\nUsually the season where red lipsticks are tentatively worn alongside our winter wardrobes, thanks to 'the Meghan-effect', nude lipsticks are higher than ever on our winter wish-lists, and being favoured over their red predecessor.\n\nWhat to Read Next\n\nWe've hunted down her reported exact lipstick in the hopes of looking a little more regal this Christmas, and provided some basic tips on how to perfect your pout to rival the Duchess:\n\nCharlotte Tilbury Matte Revolution lipstick in Very Victoria, \u00a324\n\nReported to be Markle's favourite lipstick; we love the dark blush 3D tones, and the fact that the lipstick glides on seamlessly thanks to orchid and lipstick tree extracts, slicks on with a matte finish and never looks dry on the lips thanks to a blend of oils and waxes.\n\n\n\nPreviously out of stock (unsurprisingly), Charlotte Tilbury have obviously wised up and now seems to be kept in regular stock online.\n\n3 steps to Duchess-worthy lips:\n\n\n\n1. Prime\n\nYour lips will never look like Meghan's if you just splash some lipstick onto chapped, winter lips, and slathering them with heavy lip balm first will just cause the colour to wear off immediately (an absolute disaster if you have a day of royal engagements ahead of you, which obviously we do), so priming the blank canvas first is a must, just as we would our skin.\n\nFirst, exfoliate lips gently with a lip scrub, then apply a deeply moisturising lip mask (leave on for 5 minutes, then wipe away any excess)\n\n\n\n2. Apply lipstick\n\nNow that you have the perfect base, apply lip stick with a lip brush (to get into every crevice and limit the risk of it wearing off throughout the day) evenly over the whole lip area and pay close attention to the edges - a true Duchess would never be caught dead with bleeding or smudged lipstick\n\n\n\n3. Set\n\nNow that the colour is on perfectly, you want itstay on, all that air-kissing and smiling is bound to take it's toll. Blot lips with a single sheet of tissue paper and gently dust loose powder on top of the sheet. For a more natural, dewy finish - spritz lips with a makeup setting spray, just as you would the rest of your face.", "images":
