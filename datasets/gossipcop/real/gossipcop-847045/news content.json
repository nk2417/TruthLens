The platinum-blonde star said she was most looking forward to the \u201ccostumes, dancing, and romance\u201d in the sequel to the hit 2015 Disney Channel Original Movie.\n\n\u201cDescendants 2\u201d director, choreographer, and executive producer Kenny Ortega was also on hand to fete the film, along with cast members Sofia Carson, Booboo Stewart, and Cameron Boyce, who play the progeny of some of Disney\u2019s most beloved (and ballyhooed) villains.\n\nBrenna D\u2019Amico, who portrays Jane, daughter of Fairy Godmother in \u201cDescendants,\u201d said she was most excited about the audience\u2019s reaction to the film.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cI really am looking forward to them seeing the action \u2014 there\u2019s a lot more action \u2014 the sets are bigger, the music numbers are insane, everybody\u2019s amazing, and the little love stories they\u2019ve plopped in there,\u201d she said.\n\nThe premiere also drew \u201cUnReal\u201d star Constance Zimmer, who arrived to the event with daughter, Coco, and shared a few secrets about Season 3 of the Lifetime series.\n\n\u201cI can tell you that the new season, having added an additional very strong, opinionated woman \u2014 being our bachelorette \u2014 it really adds a dimension to the whole show,\u201d Zimmer said. \u201cEven though it\u2019s the same formula, it really shifts the perspective from how women are treated, how men treat women, how women treat men, but it\u2019s not beating anybody over the head with a hammer. It\u2019s a really interesting message how we all change and shift depending for the situation.\u201d\n\nAs for \u201cDescendants 2,\u201d Zimmer was \u201cmost excited about the new character, Uma.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got blue hair and she\u2019s like a pirate,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cDescendants 2\u201d debuts on July 21 at 8 p.m. ET/PT in an unprecedented simultaneous premiere across six networks: ABC, Disney Channel, Disney XD, Freeform, Lifetime, Lifetime Movies, and branded apps.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/descendants-2.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/descendants-2.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Malina Saval", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/scene/vpage/descendants-2-premiere-dove-cameron-disney-channel-1202493764/", "title": "\u2018Descendants 2\u2019 Cast Talks \u2018Bigger\u2019 Sets and Musical Numbers at Disney Channel Premiere", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The \"Descendants 2\" cast, including Dove Cameron, Cameron Boyce, Sofia Carson, and Booboo Stewart, attend the Disney Channel premiere.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Malina Saval", "tags": "Descendants 2, Disney Channel, Dove Cameron, Kenny Ortega", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Descendants 2\u2019 Cast Talks \u2018Bigger\u2019 Sets and Musical Numbers at Disney Channel Premiere", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/scene/vpage/descendants-2-premiere-dove-cameron-disney-channel-1202493764/", "description": "The \"Descendants 2\" cast, including Dove Cameron, Cameron Boyce, Sofia Carson, and Booboo Stewart, attend the Disney Channel premiere.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/descendants-2.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "'Descendants 2' film premiere"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-12T20:22:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-12T20:22:33+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"Descendants 2\" cast, including Dove Cameron, Cameron Boyce, Sofia Carson, and Booboo Stewart, attend the Disney Channel premiere.", "site": "@variety", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Descendants 2\u2019 Cast Talks \u2018Bigger\u2019 Sets and Musical Numbers at Disney Channel Premiere", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/descendants-2.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499890953.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
