Eight hours is the time when risks start to go up of anesthesia complications and difficulties from prolonged recovery,\" he explained.\n\nView 6 Images Surgeons inserted her implants through her abdomen (Image: E!

There's one of the reasons it got an infection,\" Dr Paul Nassif confirmed to Dr Dubrow.\n\nThe ensuing gangrene left Krystle with a scar that resembled The Joker, and she was so disfigured that she couldn't even wear a bikini.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWhat's more, she later learned that the surgeon who operated on her had recently had a stroke.\n\nThankfully Dr Dubrow was able to fix Krytle's scars, giving her another chance to rock it in a two-piece.", "images": ["https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12551716.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PAY-Botched-patient-Krystle-wears-a-bikini-for-the-first-time-after-doctors-fix-her-wonky-boob-job-and-t.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12547721.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/MAIN-Lampard.jpg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/ipso.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12551753.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/PAY-MAIN-Botched.jpg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/trust-project.svg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/nav-web-static/release-v41-14493b7c888038a7d89b99cb3a7937c2b71eaebe/public/logo-reach.png", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12551717.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PAY-Botched-patient-Krystle-wears-a-bikini-for-the-first-time-after-doctors-fix-her-wonky-boob-job-and-t.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12551721.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/RLP_MDG_10778JPG.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12373979.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/Ant-McPartlin-Appears-In-Court-Charged-With-Drink-Driving.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12551715.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PAY-Botched-patient-Krystle-wears-a-bikini-for-the-first-time-after-doctors-fix-her-wonky-boob-job-and-t.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12551720.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/RLP_MDG_10777JPG.jpg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/assets/mirror/logos/masthead-mirror-default.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12551715.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PAY-Botched-patient-Krystle-wears-a-bikini-for-the-first-time-after-doctors-fix-her-wonky-boob-job-and-t.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12511246.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/MAIN-Stephen-Bear-and-his-dog-Wolverine.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12134327.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/2015-Tony-Awards-Show.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12551715.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PAY-Botched-patient-Krystle-wears-a-bikini-for-the-first-time-after-doctors-fix-her-wonky-boob-job-and-t.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Frances Kindon", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/teen-mum-contracts-gangrene-deadly-12551531", "title": "Teen mum contracts GANGRENE when deadly tummy tuck and boob job goes dangerously wrong in most stomach-churning Botched yet", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"page_id": 6149699161, "app_id": 123792601022133, "pages": 1814357575554395}, "description": "WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Krystle could have died during the 12 hour procedure that left her horribly scarred", "author": "Frances Kindon", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "Googlebot-News": "noarchive", "referrer": "unsafe-URL", "keywords": "Cosmetic surgery, Plastic surgery", "news_keywords": "Cosmetic surgery, Plastic surgery", "allowTaboolaDeepDive": "true", "vf": {"00000000-0000-4000-8000-67e599051dc3": "mirror-prod-12551531"}, "og": {"title": "Teen mum contracts gangrene when deadly tummy tuck goes dangerously wrong", "description": "WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Krystle could have died during the 12 hour procedure that left her horribly scarred", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/teen-mum-contracts-gangrene-deadly-12551531", "site_name": "Daily Mirror", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12551715.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PAY-Botched-patient-Krystle-wears-a-bikini-for-the-first-time-after-doctors-fix-her-wonky-boob-job-and-t.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-17T13:30:48Z", "modified_time": "2018-05-17T13:31:00Z", "author": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/frances-kindon/", "section": "TV News", "tag": "Plastic surgery"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@DailyMirror", "creator": "@DailyMirror", "title": "Teen mum contracts GANGRENE when deadly tummy tuck and boob job goes dangerously wrong in most stomach-churning Botched yet - The Mirror", "description": "WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT Krystle could have died during the 12 hour procedure that left her horribly scarred", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article12551715.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/PAY-Botched-patient-Krystle-wears-a-bikini-for-the-first-time-after-doctors-fix-her-wonky-boob-job-and-t.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526563848.0, "source": "https://www.mirror.co.uk", "summary": ""}
