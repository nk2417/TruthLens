It would now be unusual, according to the royal insider, for the couple not to stay with the Queen.\n\nNevertheless, the move will inevitably fuel further speculation about a rift between the two couples.\n\nRumours of tensions between Kate and Meghan have plagued the royal family for the past few months, as insiders have claimed they are \"very different people\".", "images": ["https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13618927.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/2_MAIN-Queen3.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13632200.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/0_MGP_CHP_231118queen_101queenJPG.jpg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/ipso.svg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/trust-project.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13736136.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_BESTPIX-Members-Of-The-Royal-Family-Attend-St-Mary-Magdalene-Church-In-Sandringham.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13736136.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/2_BESTPIX-Members-Of-The-Royal-Family-Attend-St-Mary-Magdalene-Church-In-Sandringham.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13763982.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_BRITAIN-ROYALS-CHRISTMAS.jpg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/nav-web-static/release-v41-14493b7c888038a7d89b99cb3a7937c2b71eaebe/public/logo-reach.png", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13763940.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/0_MAIN-What-the-royals-do-on-Christmas-Day-step-by-step.jpg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/assets/mirror/logos/masthead-mirror-default.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article21136453.ece/ALTERNATES/s810/0_Queens-Christmas-lunch-2019.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13736136.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_BESTPIX-Members-Of-The-Royal-Family-Attend-St-Mary-Magdalene-Church-In-Sandringham.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robyn Darbyshire", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/reason-meghan-harry-were-forbidden-13771509", "title": "Reason Meghan and Harry were 'forbidden' from staying with Queen last Christmas", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"page_id": 6149699161, "app_id": 123792601022133, "pages": 1814357575554395}, "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry weren't allowed to stay with the Queen last Christmas, a source claims - here's why", "author": "Robyn Darbyshire", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "Googlebot-News": "noarchive", "referrer": "unsafe-URL", "keywords": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, The Queen, Royal Family, Kate Middleton", "news_keywords": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, The Queen, Royal Family, Kate Middleton", "allowTaboolaDeepDive": "true", "vf": {"00000000-0000-4000-8000-67e599051dc3": "mirror-prod-13771509"}, "og": {"title": "Meghan and Harry had to spend Xmas away from other royals - because of the Queen", "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry weren't allowed to stay with the Queen last Christmas, a source claims - here's why", "url": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/reason-meghan-harry-were-forbidden-13771509", "site_name": "Daily Mirror", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13736136.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_BESTPIX-Members-Of-The-Royal-Family-Attend-St-Mary-Magdalene-Church-In-Sandringham.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-12-23T13:09:27Z", "modified_time": "2018-12-23T13:56:27Z", "author": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/robyn-darbyshire/", "section": "UK News", "tag": "Kate Middleton"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@DailyMirror", "creator": "@DailyMirror", "title": "Reason Meghan and Harry were 'forbidden' from staying with Queen last Christmas - The Mirror", "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry weren't allowed to stay with the Queen last Christmas, a source claims - here's why", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article13736136.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_BESTPIX-Members-Of-The-Royal-Family-Attend-St-Mary-Magdalene-Church-In-Sandringham.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1545570567.0, "source": "https://www.mirror.co.uk", "summary": ""}
