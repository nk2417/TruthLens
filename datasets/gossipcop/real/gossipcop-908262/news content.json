I could\u2019ve never imagined that was the path I was going to go down, but I\u2019m so grateful for all of it.\"\n\nHyland, a self-professed Bachelor Nation superfan, connected with Wells over Instagram last year after seeing him on the show, and the two hit it off spectacularly.\n\nIn fact, Adams revealed that Bachelor host Chris Harrison even takes a bit of credit for his happy relationship.\n\n\"One thing you [didn\u2019t see on this season of Bachelor in Paradise], was when I walked down the stairs and Chris Harrison was like, 'You\u2019re welcome for your girlfriend!' And it\u2019s so true!\" Adams recalled. \"If I hadn\u2019t done the show and met Chris and all those people, I would have never had the opportunity to meet this amazing woman. So, I won the show!\"\n\nAdams finally moved to Los Angeles from his hometown of Nashville, Tennessee, a month ago when he began living together with Hyland, and he says their life under the same roof has pretty harmonious.\n\n\"It's been weirdly perfect, there have been no real issues. We were scared about the dogs meeting, but that went really well. It\u2019s been perfect. It\u2019s been great,\" Adams shared.\n\nWith the couple approaching the 1-year anniversary of the day they met, Adams reflected on what that moment meant for him and how it changed his life.\n\n\"It was the night before the Emmys party, and it was the day I knew I was going to move to L.A.,\" he explained, adding that Hyland is \"the one, for sure.\"\n\nFor Adams, the romance between him and Hyland came at the exact right moment in his life, and he was prepared to jump at the chance at finding love and cultivating their relationship. But getting into that headspace came after growing up a bit, emotionally.\n\n\"For me, you need to be ready [for the relationship.] If you watch The Bachelor, some people are like, \u2018I\u2019m really ready,\u2019 and you\u2019re not -- you\u2019re 24 years old. And I think there came a point in my life where I was like, I really do want this. I don\u2019t want to be single anymore. This isn\u2019t fun for me,\" Adams reflected.\n\n\"I think you have to be emotionally ready for that and that\u2019s number one,\" he added. \"Then I think think you have to find the person that compliments you the best, and Sarah is that for me. We\u2019re both huge dorks, we have similar interests. Our brands are the same! Dogs, rose, tacos, [and] The Bachelor!\"\n\nRecently, ET caught up with Hyland at the sixth biennial Stand Up To Cancer telecast in Santa Monica, California, where she opened up about moving in with her boyfriend and how their relationship as impacted her life.\n\nCheck out the video below to hear more.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-09/sarah_hyland_wells_adams_gettyimages-950077588_1440.jpg?h=2d44e782&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-12/gettyimages-877379988.jpg?h=a6a0bbbf&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-08/1280_spl5014188_003.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2023-12/GettyImages-1834147022.jpg?h=585579a2&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-09/149492_1024r1_1.jpg?h=5ef483e1&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-09/sarah_hyland_wells_adams_gettyimages-950077588_1440.jpg?h=2d44e782", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-09/sarah_hyland_wells_adams_gettyimages-950077588_1440.jpg?h=2d44e782", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/wells-adams-says-living-with-girlfriend-sarah-hyland-has-been-weirdly-perfect-exclusive-109475", "title": "Wells Adams Says Living With Girlfriend Sarah Hyland Has Been 'Weirdly Perfect' (Exclusive)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-09/sarah_hyland_wells_adams_gettyimages-950077588_1440.jpg?h=2d44e782", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 34-year-old reality star also revealed to ET that he feels the 'Modern Family' actress is 'the one.'", "title": "Wells Adams Admits Girlfriend Sarah Hyland Is 'The One'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/wells-adams-says-living-with-girlfriend-sarah-hyland-has-been-weirdly-perfect-exclusive-109475", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 34-year-old reality star also revealed to ET that he feels the 'Modern Family' actress is 'the one.'", "twitter": {"description": "The 34-year-old reality star also revealed to ET that he feels the 'Modern Family' actress is 'the one.'", "title": "Wells Adams Admits Girlfriend Sarah Hyland Is 'The One'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/wells-adams-says-living-with-girlfriend-sarah-hyland-has-been-weirdly-perfect-exclusive-109475", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-09/sarah_hyland_wells_adams_gettyimages-950077588_1440.jpg?h=2d44e782", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Wells Adams Says Living With Girlfriend Sarah Hyland Has Been 'Weirdly Perfect' (Exclusive) | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, TV, Wells Adams, Sarah Hyland, Bachelor In Paradise, Roses and Rose", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
