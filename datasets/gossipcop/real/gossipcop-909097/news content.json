The title comes from the name of the firehouse at the center of the story.\n\nThe 10-episode spinoff, picked up straight to series, is set in Seattle and focuses on firefighters from the captain down the ranks to the newest recruit in their personal and professional lives. The castmembers are expected to be introduced in an episode of the flagship series this season. The firefighter series will be the second spinoff to come out of Grey\u2019s Anatomy following Kate Walsh starrer Private Practice. The latter ran for six seasons and wrapped its run in 2013.\n\nFrom Shonda Rhimes and her Shondaland partner Betsy Beers, Station 19 is penned by Grey\u2019s Anatomy alum Stacy McKee, who serves as showrunner. She also exec produces the ABC Studios drama, alongside producing director Barclay. Grey\u2019s star Ellen Pompeo recently added a co-exec producer credit on the spinoff as well.\n\nJaina Lee Ortiz (Rosewood) leads a cast that includes Grey\u2019s Anatomy regular Jason George, who will segue to the spinoff this season; Grey Damon (Friday Night Lights); Miguel Sandoval (Bad Judge); Okieriete Onaodowan (Hamilton); Danielle Savre (Too Close to Home); Jay Hayden (The Catch); Barrett Doss (Iron Fist); and Alberto Frezza (Dead of Summer).\n\nDelays in show titles are not uncommon; Grey\u2019s Anatomy did not have a title right away, while Scandal was not that show\u2019s original name, either.\n\nAs for what to expect from the spinoff, McKee said it exists in the same universe as Grey\u2019s \u2014 the joke is that Fire Station 19 is three blocks away from Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. The showrunner called the spinoff \u201cGrey\u2019s adjacent\u201d and said there was \u201ca lot of potential for cross-pollination,\u201d noting that they would be excited to have crossover with the characters or places from the flagship in \u201csmall ways or big ways.\u201d\n\nStation 19 premieres March 22 at 9 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/148056_0279_copy_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/148056_0279_copy_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Goldberg", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/greys-anatomy-firefighter-spinoff-title-station-19-1078408/", "title": "\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Firefighter Spinoff (Finally) Gets a Title", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Station 19, the much-anticipated firefighter spinoff of Grey's Anatomy.
