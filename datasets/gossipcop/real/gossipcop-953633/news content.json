He was also lifting props without a problem.\n\nTMZ broke the story ... George slammed into a car going 60 mph in Sardinia. He went flying, nearly 20 ft into the air, before slamming down to the ground. Still, he walked away from the accident with bruises and zero broken bones.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/3e/16by9/2018/07/14/3e287872a4b2510ab8b370a91392900c_xs.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/thirtymilezone.svg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e3/16by9/2025/11/20/e3028a12684b463faee721ff211e9954_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/0f/16by9/2025/11/20/0fe06478a3e241edaa03423e7f006606_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/de/4by3/2025/11/19/def9d7aac6b04006a89c0cf3fb46eb21_xxs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/12/16by9/2018/07/20/12f2929aed605c20a8352f48b956567a_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/d3/16by9/2018/07/20/d3c35b12ccbb5c4f80528aa182aaf417_xl.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/b6/o/2018/07/20/b6d8c58af8cc52f69d6917c2ab912437_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/b4/16by9/2025/11/20/b4fbe4e8e5654748a5497e1a52b939b1_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/2a/16by9/2018/06/22/2a7c338eb6515bf5b1e135a27329f7f3_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e4/16by9/2025/11/20/e4ccda421f7140fb91551c634a62d9dc_xs.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/article/google-preferred-source.png", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/72/16by9/2025/11/20/726f88d680674fccaa77ad055cd10d2e_xs.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/d3/16by9/2018/07/20/d3c35b12ccbb5c4f80528aa182aaf417_xl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2018/07/20/george-clooney-work-scooter-accident/", "title": "George Clooney Back to Work 10 Days After Scooter Accident", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=0.25,maximum-scale=10", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "google-site-verification": "UUmtbUBf3djgPpCeLefe_PbFsOc6JGxfXmHzpjFLAEQ", "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "p": {"domain_verify": "933e74ace98032aadbc3328616280038"}, "robots": "index,follow,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "description": "George Clooney looked as good as new walking around on set in Sutri, Italy and it's nothing short of a miracle.", "fb": {"app_id": 310610065699820}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tmz"}, "og": {"site_name": "TMZ", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.tmz.com/2018/07/20/george-clooney-work-scooter-accident/", "title": "George Clooney Back to Work 10 Days After Scooter Accident", "description": "George Clooney looked as good as new walking around on set in Sutri, Italy and it's nothing short of a miracle.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/d3/16by9/2018/07/20/d3c35b12ccbb5c4f80528aa182aaf417_xl.jpg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TMZ", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "George Clooney Back to Work 10 Days After Scooter Accident", "description": "George Clooney looked as good as new walking around on set in Sutri, Italy and it's nothing short of a miracle.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/d3/16by9/2018/07/20/d3c35b12ccbb5c4f80528aa182aaf417_xl.jpg"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=299948601, app-argument=https://www.tmz.com/2018/07/20/george-clooney-work-scooter-accident/?tmz#article", "application-name": "TMZ.COM", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TMZ.COM", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/msapplication-tile-image-270x270-v1.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.tmz.com/?adid=IE9pin", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#000000", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-tooltip": "TMZ | Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Photos;action-uri=https://www.tmz.com/photos/;icon-uri=https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/favicon-32x32-v1.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532059200.0, "source": "https://www.tmz.com", "summary": ""}
