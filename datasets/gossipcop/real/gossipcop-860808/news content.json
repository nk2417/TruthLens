It appears to involve questions about whether a sexual encounter occurred between two cast members, and whether one of them was too inebriated to give consent.\n\nMike Johansson, a senior lecturer for the School of Communication at the Rochester Institute of Technology who has closely followed reality shows, believes that viewers will continue to tune into the \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise, even if something terrible occurred.\n\n\u201cIt goes back to the old P.T. Barnum thing \u2014 there\u2019s no such thing as bad publicity, and this will make people want to watch this particular show even more,\u201d he told TheWrap.\n\nJohansson doesn\u2019t expect the series to enact any significant changes or to limit contestants\u2019 access to booze. He said the only potential impact might be that networks make it harder for productions to grind to a halt mid-season.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d like to think that [a change in alcohol access] would happen, but honestly I think the only change that might come out of this is watertight contracts,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a litigious society that if there turns out to be a way that people can bail on the show mid-filming, they\u2019ll probably want to zip that up pretty quick because it gets expensive to produce these things and not end up with anything you can put on TV and sell ads around.\u201d\n\nCertainly, there are previous instances of sex leading to scrutiny for the \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise. In her 2014 memoir \u201cI Didn\u2019t Come Here to Make Friends,\u201d \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d Season 16 winner Courtney Robertson wrote that she and Ben Flajnik had sex in the ocean during a date while the show\u2019s cameras were rolling.\n\n\u201cTo answer your question, yes, Ben and I did have sex in the ocean. On-camera,\u201d she wrote. And she added that Flajnik had concerns after the fact: \u201cHe was like, \u2018Well, 50,000 people just saw that.\u2019\u201d\n\nChristopher Ferguson, a professor of psychology at Stetson University who has contributed to Time and Huffington Post, told TheWrap that dating shows carry \u201csome potential for risk to be sure,\u201d particularly when alcohol is involved. He said that \u201ccontestants may be pushed by producers toward actions they wouldn\u2019t normally take.\u201d\n\nJohansson said situations like the one the show faces aren\u2019t often in the public eye, but added: \u201cThings like this probably have happened in the past, and I think people have been talked back off the ledge \u2014 talked out of quitting the show, deciding to cooperate \u2014 by whatever means.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have heard rumors of people being offered extra monetary enticements to stay on shows,\u201d said Johansson. \u201cI\u2019ve heard of people being basically getting reminded that they did sign a contract, and that breach of contract lawsuits can get expensive. There\u2019s all kinds of reasons I\u2019m sure that people have been kept on shows when they\u2019ve decided to think they probably didn\u2019t want to be on it anymore.\u201d\n\nRichard Gerrig, a professor of psychology at Stony Brook University and author of the book \u201cThe Psychology of Survivor,\u201d doesn\u2019t find it likely that the \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d shutdown will make the \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise less popular. He points out that people continue to tune in despite general questions about the level of producer interference within the reality TV genre.\n\n\u201cMy gut sense is that if people are willing to overlook that what they\u2019re watching is not real in the way that it is advertised as real, then this is kind of a funny situation where [the allegation] doesn\u2019t strike me as being a game changer or a deal breaker \u2014 [although] maybe it should be,\u201d he said.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325_COVER-_IR_5x4.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bachelor-in-Paradise-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bachelor-in-Paradise-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Gajewski", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid", "Border-Radius Box-Shadow Rgba", "Rgba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/will-bachelor-in-paradise-controversy-hurt-the-appeal-of-dating-shows/", "title": "\u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 Debacle Could Help the Show, Experts Say", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Bachelor in Paradise' Debacle Could Help the Show, Experts Say", "description": "Warner Bros. shut down production of Season 4 on Sunday following \"allegations of misconduct\"", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/will-bachelor-in-paradise-controversy-hurt-the-appeal-of-dating-shows/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Bachelor-in-Paradise-1.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-13T02:17:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-13T03:19:37+00:00"}, "author": "Ryan Gajewski", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Ryan Gajewski", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "4 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "bachelor-in-paradise, the-bachelor, the_bachelorette", "article-section": "news", "article-categories": "news, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497320242.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
