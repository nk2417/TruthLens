On Monday, the eldest Kardashian sister touched down in Washington, D.C., where she reportedly addressed Congress to discuss reforms to outdated federal cosmetics regulations. According to TMZ, Kardashian has teamed up with the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit that does research and advocacy focused on corporate accountability and sustainable materials. The work trip is also reportedly being filmed for a future episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nKardashian documented her arrival in D.C. in an Instagram Story on Monday. The 39-year-old mom of three posted a video of her plane touching down, writing, \"Hi, Washington, D.C.,\" followed by a snap of a conference table spread with an EWG tote bag and cookbook, which she captioned, \"Meetings #beautymadebetter.\" According to the EWG website, the #BeautyMadeBetter tag is part of a movement for cosmetics safety reform: \"Current laws leave the federal government powerless to screen personal care products for chemicals that have been linked to cancer, harm to the reproductive system in both men and women, and severe allergies, among other health effects,\" the site reads.", "images":
