Not only is she wearing a stylish new pixie cut, but she\u2019s also sporting some serious biceps.\n\nThe \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d alum underwent some intense training for an upcoming role in which she plays an ex-Marine. According to her recent interview with Women\u2019s Health, Holmes is \u201ca startling combination of litheness and sinew.\u201d\n\nSo just how did the actress get into such tip-top shape? We break down the star\u2019s tough-yet-doable new workout.\n\nShe Does SoulCycle\n\n\u201cI like that sense of community,\u201d Holmes explains to the magazine. \u201cBeing surrounded by other people adds an element of inspiration, \u2018like, if she can do it, I can do it too.'\u201d\n\nGroup fitness classes are extremely beneficial for a number of reasons. As Holmes mentioned, they are an amazing way of motivating yourself and others to dig deeper and push yourself further. Plus, group fitness is a great way to get a workout in without having to think or plan a workout \u2014 perfect for people on the go \u2014 and a fitness class instructor will help you with technique and form, which will only make you perform better.\n\nFactor in a positive environment like SoulCycle \u2014 which also predicts you\u2019ll burn between 500 to 700 calories per sweat session \u2014 and you\u2019re in for one fat-burning, life-affirming ride.\n\nShe Lifts Weights\n\nHolmes worked out with a trainer for her intense new role, which involved two-hour sessions with a number of squats, crunches, and working out with weights. \u201cI was a five-pound-weight person, and now I can do 15, 20,\u201d she said.\n\nStrength training is a vital component of exercise. It not only builds muscle but can prevent disease, improve mood, and help you lose weight. In fact, lifting weights is known to boost your metabolism, creating an after-burn effect, which means you\u2019ll be blasting calories even while you\u2019re at rest.\n\nNot to mention it helps create those sculpted \u2014 or should we say \u2018sinewy\u2019 \u2014 arms and legs just like Holmes\u2019.\n\nShe Boxes\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing a lot of boxing, which I had never done before. It\u2019s thrilling,\u201d Holmes told the magazine. \u201cYou can get out the stress of the day. I just go in there and think of all the mundane things that bother me. Traffic! I put off all my phone calls till after boxing, because it puts me in a much calmer place.\u201d\n\nHolmes is the latest star to fall in love with boxing, but there\u2019s a good reason why. Boxing is one of the most intense cardiovascular activities for athletes of many different fitness levels by providing high-intensity, calorie-burning routines that helps strengthen your arms, legs, and core. It\u2019s also known to bust stress, helping to alleviate feelings of depression and anxiety.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nPerhaps the ultimate takeaway from Holmes\u2019 workout is her dedication to changing it up. By switching up your exercise routine you\u2019re constantly challenging your body, which will lead to more results and put you at less risk of hitting that dreaded plateau. Though her workout is tough, what you will discover about yourself through your fitness journey is well worth it.\n\nAs Holmes tells the mag, \u201cYour broken self is more beautiful than your original, pure self. It\u2019s not really your broken self, but it\u2019s your traveled self. That\u2019s what I thought was beautiful.\u201d\n\nRelated on Organic Authority\n\nThe Top 5 Fitness Trends Worth the Hype\n\n3 Ways Celebs Cope With Their Anxiety Through Exercise\n\nMeghan Markle\u2019s 5 Simple Health and Fitness Essentials You Gotta Try", "images": ["https://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/MTY4NTgxODA3MjM3NzY4OTgy.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201920%201920'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/img_1155-428x428.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2030%2030'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20601%20207'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=533469367234380&ev=PageView &noscript=1", "https://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/how-katie-holmes-got-into-the-best-shape-of-her-life.png", "https://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/how-katie-holmes-got-into-the-best-shape-of-her-life-1000x630.png", "https://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MTc0MzE3MDkyMzUzMzUzMzUw.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2070%2070'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/how-katie-holmes-got-into-the-best-shape-of-her-life.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brianne Hogan", "Brianne", "Hogan", "Is", "A", "Canadian", "Writer", "Currently", "Based", "In"], "canonical_link": "https://www.organicauthority.com/energetic-health/how-katie-holmes-got-into-the-best-shape-of-her-life", "title": "How Katie Holmes Got Into the Best Shape of Her Life", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "pubexchange": {"image": "https://www.organicauthority.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/how-katie-holmes-got-into-the-best-shape-of-her-life-428x342.png"}, "description": "For an upcoming new role, Katie Holmes trained like a marine.
