Here, how to make a truly pro-approved pick on which type of bang is best for your face shape plus how to style them so they always look fresh and on point.\n\nMeet the expert Lucy Gedjeyan, celebrity hairstylist and owner of Lucy Luna Beauty Salon\n\nLaura Polko, celebrity hairstylist and Sc\u00fcnci ambassador\n\nJacelyn Bautista, hairstylist at NYC The Team Hair Salon by MH\n\nFind Examples With Your Face Shape\n\nFirst, determine what your face shape is. You can do that by measuring your face. Then, you can look to your favorite celebs who have a similar face shape to you for inspiration.\n\nNext, with a few examples and inspiration photos in tow, Gedjeyan recommends sharing all with your hairstylist, as no one knows you (and your face and hair) better than them. \u201cIt\u2019s also great to keep in mind that some bang styles may be more maintenance than you\u2019re willing to deal with, so it\u2019s important to gather that insight from a stylist ahead of making any new bang decisions,\u201d she explains. \u201cAfter an in-depth consultation with the pro, you\u2019ll definitely feel more at ease and excited about your chic new look.\u201d\n\nChoosing the Right Bangs for Your Face Shape\n\nRound Face Shape\n\nGetty Images\n\n\u201cSide swept bangs work well for those who have a round face shape because it can create an angle that the face doesn\u2019t necessarily have already and can also help elongate the face,\u201d explains hairstylis Laura Polko. Face framing bangs also work well, as they narrow the face and create a more angular look, Polko explains. Hairstylist Jacelyn Bautista also recommends a side-sweeping style to soften round faces. Gedjeyan suggests opting for curtain bangs. \u201cCurtain bangs or side swept bangs are usually the perfect complement to a round face because they add some extra dimension and work to elongate the face,\u201d she says.\n\nStyling and Maintenance Tips\n\nLuckily, side swept bangs tend toward low maintenance, Polko says. She recommends blow drying them to the side and using hairspray to keep them in place. They also work with a range of hair textures, particularly straight or wavy hair types. Bautista recommends reaching for a fine tooth comb to blow dry the roots of the fringe in both directions of side swept bangs. \u201cIt ensures that the roots are not flat to the head,\u201d she explains, adding that you should dry them 50 percent and then go in with a small round brush to blow dry with volumizing spray (she likes Shu Uemura Tsuki Shape Blow Dry Spray). \u201cIf you have curly hair with more density, you want to go straight in with the round brush with lots of tension to ensure smoothness and avoid frizz,\u201d she says.\n\nSquare Face Shape\n\nGetty Images\n\n\u201cI love a fringe or bottleneck bang for anyone with a square face shape,\u201d shares Gedjeyan. \u201cSince this look is slightly shorter in the center and has more length on the sides, they can soften the appearance by framing the eyes and face.\u201d Polko suggests long and layered bangs, which can help soften the angles of a square face. \u201cAlso, the classic Birkin bang is great for square shaped faces because they have a soft, feathery effortless look.\u201d Bautista prefers a straight across wispy fringe. \u201cThese bangs accentuate the sharpness of the face shape while keeping a softer look,\u201d she shares. \u201cThese bangs are edgy but also have a sophisticated look\u2014you can wear your hair down with beach waves or put your hair up in a messy up do.\u201d\n\nStyling and Maintenance Tips\n\nPolko explains that the Birkin bangs are ideal for someone who wants minimum styling and upkeep. \u201cThey are low maintenance compared to other styles of bangs, meaning you have to trim them less and can allow them to grow out,\u201d she says. These bangs also work on a range of hair textures. Bautista loves to style the straight across wispy fringe either by adding body or keeping them sleek and smooth. \u201cWhen adding body, you want to add Milbon Thickening Mist first, then blow dry the roots in the opposite direction then forward with a small round brush,\u201d she explains. \u201cIf you have a strong cowlick on your hairline, you can blow dry the roots when completely wet with a fine tooth comb in all directions\u2014 side to side and forward\u2014to control it.\u201d\n\nHeart Face Shape\n\nGetty Images\n\n\u201cBlunt bangs are a great style for a heart face shape because it can help balance out the wider forehead area of the heart shape,\u201d explains Polko. According to Bautista, it\u2019s all about the Bardot bang. \u201cThey are cut slightly shorter in the center where most people may have a widow's peak and are longer towards the edges,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd they tend to split naturally where the part is but you want to allow the fringe to do its thing.\u201d Gedjeyan says that heart shaped faces look best with wispy or feathery bangs. \u201cThis style of bangs really helps to soften this face that is typically more on the angular shaped side.\u201d\n\nStyling and Maintenance Tips\n\nPolko recommends following up any heat styling with a texture spray. \u201cIt\u2019s best to style Bardot bangs freehanded with your hands, shaping and blow drying them naturally,\u201d Bautista says. \u201cYou can also use a butterfly clip to hold the part in place which gives a softer and natural outcome to the style; or add a texture spray to add grit and texture to your fringe.\u201d Gedjeyan recommends reaching for a paddle brush when styling a wispy fringe.\n\nOval Face Shape\n\nGetty Images\n\nGedjeyan recommends blunt bangs for oval face shapes. Polko says \u201cthe oval face shape is one of the more universal face shapes, therefore many different styles of bangs can work well with it,\u201d she says. \u201cPersonally, I prefer curtain bangs because they can further amplify the symmetry of the oval face shape.\u201d She also says they are a great option for someone who likes to change up the finished look. \u201cCurtain bangs have the versatility to be short and rest right above the eyebrows but also be longer and wispy for more of a side swept look,\u201d she explains. Bautista recommends opting for soft layered bangs, which she says can help accentuate the layers and texture in the rest of your hair.\n\nStyling and Maintenance Tips\n\nBautista recommends prepping the hair with a texture spray or paste, following up with a round brush, and then adding finishing touches with your hands. (She likes Kevin Murphy Powder Puff Volumising Powder and Davines This Is A Medium Hold Pliable Paste.) Polko\u2019s pro styling tip is to \u201cpart hair down the middle and then brush each side away from the face,\u201d she says. \u201cCurtain bangs can work with any hairstyle, especially longer curtain bangs,\u201d she adds. Gedjeyan notes that blunt-cut bangs are definitely a statement and require much more maintenance than other bangs.\n\n", "images":
