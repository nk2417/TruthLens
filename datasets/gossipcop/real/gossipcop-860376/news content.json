Kendra\u2019s Faking It for TV.\u201d\n\n\u201c2. Yes we are having issues,\u201d she continued. \u201c3. My job has been reality tv for 13 years 4. My show was a comedy and light hearted til sad times happened then we had to change my show from comedy to drama. Not what i wanted but was a part of my journey and story.\u201d\n\nIn a fifth point, Kendra shared that \u201cthese issues Hank n I are having in our home which we are tryin to hard to over come, everyone knows about, including producers and network, friends and family.\u201d\n\n\u201c6. My job is reality TV and I love my job unfortunately these issues at home are affecting my decisions cuz the last thing i want to do is hurt Hank,\u201d she shared. \u201c7. I hope to get back to the fun Kendra you all know. That\u2019s all i want n aim for. I hate drama!!!\u201d\n\nShe concluded by thanking fans for their \u201csupport and understanding me at this time. I\u2019ve been in a lot of therapy lately n hope all gets resolved for me, Hank,kids and even for TV. Lol \ud83d\ude02\u201d\n\n\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BYQ0jj6AYdQ/?taken-by=kendra_wilkinson_baskett\n\nThe couple wed in 2009 and have welcomed two children \u2014 son Hank IV, 8, and daughter Alijah, 3 \u2014 over the course of their marriage, which was rocked by a scandal four years ago.\n\nIn 2014, Hank allegedly had an affair with a transgender model while Kendra was eight months pregnant. But despite the cheating scandal, the two have remained committed to one another.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re different people than we were years ago,\u201d Kendra told PEOPLE in April 2017. \u201cYou know, you change. But you have to change together. You have to grow together, not apart, and that\u2019s the challenge.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re in the healthiest place we\u2019ve ever been,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s all about each other. We want to help build each other and love each other and make sure we\u2019re happy. When we went through our big issue that was scattered everywhere, it needed to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, it was a really rough situation,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I\u2019m a very faithful person and I think it really worked out for the best.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kendra\u2019s Ultimatum!
