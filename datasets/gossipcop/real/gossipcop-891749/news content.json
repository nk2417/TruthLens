The Hollywood Film Awards are held annually since 1997. The gala ceremony takes place at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. The event was hosted by James Cordon for the third time in a row.\n\nOne of the best moments in this year\u2019s ceremony was when Kate Winslet \u2013 who was being honored for her performance in the new Woody Allen movie Wonder Wheel \u2014 began her speech by praising the creativity in the room.
