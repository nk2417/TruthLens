Her friendship with the other women in the series.\n\nThe realtor told E! News she really bonded with her fellow contestants, saying, \u201cI left this with amazing women who are going to be friends for like, there are bridesmaids-status friends here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had envisioned this Tell All for a long time and how it would go down and then obviously life happened and s\u2014 happened,\u201d Caroline said after confronting Arie, \u201cAnd so for me, I was really close with a lot of the girls in the house, especially a few that remained at the end. For me, it was a no-brainer, I needed to have that best friend moment, where you\u2019re like, \u2018Hey, I know what you did, screw you.\u2019 We all wish we could have that moment for our friends and for ourselves. I never got close enough to him to have it be about me.\u201d\n\nAnd while Caroline can\u2019t say what happens at the end of the season with Arie and the final three women \u2014 Becca Kufrin, Lauren Burnham and Kendall Long \u2014 she said she was \u201cfurious\u201d when she learned what the race car driver did.\n\n\u201cI had heard a little rumor along the way,\u201d Caroline said, adding she didn\u2019t think it could be true at the time. \u201cI then called and I had gotten that confirmation and I was furious, honestly. You\u2019ll see why. I\u2019m heartbroken the way things went down, the way he handled it. I think it could\u2019ve been handled much better and it wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nBut on stage, Arie didn\u2019t really address Caroline\u2019s comments in depth, just saying, \u201cI think that will play out in the weeks to come.\u201d\n\nThe Bachelor airs Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\nPhoto credit: ABC", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/zach-bryan.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-lainey-wilson-devlin-hodges-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Rumer", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/news/bachelor-arie-luyendyk-i-know-what-you-did/", "title": "Arie Luyendyk Jr. Confronted by \u2018Bachelor\u2019 Contestant: \u2018I Know What You Did\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Arie Luyendyk Jr. Confronted by 'Bachelor' Contestant: 'I Know What You Did'", "description": "Bachelor Nation is waiting for the other shoe (or should we say rose) to drop after Arie Luyendyk Jr. faced a cryptic confrontation during the Women Tell All special Sunday evening.
