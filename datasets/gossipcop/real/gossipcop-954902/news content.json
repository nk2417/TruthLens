Online sat down with the cast of Deadpool 2 at Comic-Con this past weekend. The interview, similar to the film, was filled with dirty and fun jokes. When the interviewer asked Reynolds about the infamous red and black costume, he said that he doesn\u2019t have to deal with the chaffing of wearing such a tight costume anymore.\n\n\u201cOh I got that down for the second movie,\u201d Reynolds explained. He then continued saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a very specific system. It\u2019s a homemade recipe my mom came up with. She lives in Vancouver so she can come over and get it on me before we shoot.\u201d\n\nReynolds\u2019 mom was actually in the audience during the interview, playing along with the joke.\n\nReynolds then said, \u201cShe did the whole cast before we got her,\u201d continuing to play along to the chaffing joke.\n\nThe interviewer then asked Reynolds if he\u2019s allowed to cuss in front of his mother, being that Deadpool is filled with cusses. He joked saying that they usually \u201cbeep it out,\u201d but then went onto say \u201cYeah, she\u2019s heard it all, I\u2019m the youngest of four boys.\u201d\n\nThe cast were at Comic-Con to promote the release of Deadpool 2: Super Duper Cut which is an extended version of the theatrical release. It features alternate jokes as well as extended and deleted scenes. Reynolds said that they shot so many alternate versions of every joke that they could basically release a different film.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post , the cast teased a little bit of Deadpool 2: Super Duper Cut at a panel and fans were all for it.\n\nReynolds Instagrammed his appreciation of attending the event and being Deadpool. He posted a photo of himself at the panel with the caption, \u201cBeing the drunk uncle of the Marvel universe is a responsibility I take seriously. Loved bringing the #Deadpool2Super Duper F\u2019n Cut to #SDCC \u2014 out on Digital August 7 & Blu-ray August 21\u201d\n\nReynolds is also slated to voice the title character in Detective Pikachu out next year. The movie is based on the Pokemon franchise. According to his IMDb , Deadpool 3 has also been announced as well as the film X-Force in which Reynolds will be reprising Deadpool for both of them. Neither films has a release date set yet.", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2421769f-57a4-4bff-913f-cf316747493e.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20157'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20492%20142'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo-white.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent-Dark-Mode.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7e7baf2a062d45df7ee9c21f525245d9?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20120%20120'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/ryan-reynolds-explains-how-his-mom-helps-him-squeeze-into-the-deadpool-suit", "title": "Ryan Reynolds Explains How His Mom Helps Him Squeeze Into The Deadpool Suit", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.png", "description": "E!
