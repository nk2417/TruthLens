This time, he is the star of four teasers for a spot we\u2019ll never see.\n\nBetter known as Ross Geller from Friends, Schwimmer in the commercial Skittles says it will show during Super Bowl LII to a single fan, teenager Marcos Menendez of Los Angeles.\n\nA quartet of 15-second teasers for the secretive DDB spot were released, in which Schwimmer plays four different characters, each with a quirkiness one would expect from the \u201cTaste the Rainbow\u201d candy brand. In each teaser Schwimmer wears a different wig; in another, he dons a mustache. All films share the ungrammatical tagline \u201cExclusive the rainbow. Taste the rainbow.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEmFS50lsTw&list=PLQYWCsTsS9XlqWSjydL_r1zm8rDrwWLwE\n\nThe final commercial is set to be shown only to Menendez, according to Skittles.\n\nSchwimmer says he was intrigued by the idea of showing a Super Bowl-worthy commercial to a single person. \u201cI just thought it was really funny and inherently subversive,\u201d says Schwimmer, who says Skittles\u2019 ads appeal to his own sense of humor.\n\nNot even the star knows which of the characters will ultimately be shown to Menendez.\n\n\u201cNot only do I not know, I\u2019m not even going to see it,\u201d Schwimmer told AdAge, and said he may try to convince someone to show him a cut of the chosen spot.", "images": ["https://www.media-marketing.com/wp-content/plugins/sitepress-multilingual-cms/res/flags/bs.png", "https://www.media-marketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/media-marketing-redakcija.jpg", "https://www.media-marketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Media-Marketing-1.svg", "https://www.media-marketing.com/wp-content/plugins/sitepress-multilingual-cms/res/flags/en.png", "https://www.media-marketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/david-schwimmer-glumi-u-super-bowl-oglasu-za-skittles-koji-mi-nikada-necemo-vidjeti.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.media-marketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/david-schwimmer-glumi-u-super-bowl-oglasu-za-skittles-koji-mi-nikada-necemo-vidjeti.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Media Marketing Redakcija", "Media Marketing Is The Most Relevant Media In The Communications Industry Of The Adriatic Region", "Created With An Idea", "The Vision To Educate", "Inform", "Bring The Professionals The Industry Together On Daily Basis."], "canonical_link": "https://www.media-marketing.com/en/news/david-schwimmer-stars-in-a-super-bowl-ad-we-will-never-get-to-see/", "title": "David Schwimmer stars in a Super Bowl ad we will never get to see", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "David Schwimmer stars in a Super Bowl ad we will never get to see", "site_name": "Media Marketing", "description": "Source: Creativity It's been 23 years since David Schwimmer starred in a TV commercial, and now we write about him", "url": "https://www.media-marketing.com/en/news/david-schwimmer-stars-in-a-super-bowl-ad-we-will-never-get-to-see/", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.media-marketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/david-schwimmer-glumi-u-super-bowl-oglasu-za-skittles-koji-mi-nikada-necemo-vidjeti.jpg", "width": 1441, "height": 919, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-26T05:10:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2024-08-05T08:12:26+00:00", "section": "News", "tag": "Super Bowl", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mediamarketingcom"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "David Schwimmer stars in a Super Bowl ad we will never get to see", "description": "Source: Creativity It's been 23 years since David Schwimmer starred in a TV commercial, and now we write about him", "url": "https://www.media-marketing.com/en/news/david-schwimmer-stars-in-a-super-bowl-ad-we-will-never-get-to-see/", "image": {"src": "https://www.media-marketing.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/david-schwimmer-glumi-u-super-bowl-oglasu-za-skittles-koji-mi-nikada-necemo-vidjeti.jpg", "width": 1441, "height": 919}, "creator": "@MediaMarketing", "site": "@MediaMarketing", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Media Marketing redakcija", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "description": "It's been 23 years since David Schwimmer starred in a TV commercial, and now we write about him on our portal twice in two days in a row.
