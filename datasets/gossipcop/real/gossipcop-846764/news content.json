It will begin Sept. 19 in the United States and end in Japan in early December.\n\nAll tickets go on sale on Friday, May 5 (excluding Japan) via local ticketing agents. Those sales begin just a week ahead of the debut of Styles\u2019 self-titled debut album, which will be released May 12.\n\nFan registration for all North American dates has commenced, though supplies are limited. To prevent other vendors from re-selling tickets at higher prices, concert-goers can sign up for Ticketmaster\u2019s Verified Fan program.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nStyles began promoting the tour with performances of his new tracks on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and BBC\u2019s \u201cThe Graham Norton Show\u201d earlier in April.
