{"url": "https://people.com/music/travis-scott-helps-fan-attacked-security-guards/", "text": "Travis Scott will always have his fans\u2019 backs.\n\nThe father of one, 26, helped out a fan during a set at the Rolling Loud Festival in Miami, Florida, on Saturday. Scott was in the middle of a performance when a fan climbed onto the stage after the rapper invited the fan to join him.\n\nIn a video of the performance, Scott can be seen helping the man onto the stage around the 18-minute mark but security guards quickly close in on the fan, with one shoving him to the floor before landing a kick.\n\nThe rapper wasn\u2019t having it and shoved the guards away from the fan and helped him to his feet while the audience cheered.\n\nA rep for Scott did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAfter the guards left the stage, Scott lent the microphone to the fan as the latter jumped around and did his best to recite the lyrics. When it was time for the fan to return to the audience, Scott helped him out by asking for the lights to be turned out and warned police officers to stay away.\n\n\u201cSecurity don\u2019t you touch him. Turn the lights on. Hold on. I got you,\u201d Scott told the concertgoer. \u201cDon\u2019t do that cop, he\u2019s okay, he\u2019s okay. He\u2019s a part of the show. He\u2019s all right.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone with a camera put your cameras down, help this kid,\u201d he added before continuing with the concert.\n\nScott\u2019s concert comes a week after he and girlfriend Kylie Jenner walked the red carpet together at the 2018 Met Gala in New York.\n\nThe couple welcomed 3-month-old daughter Stormi Webster on Feb. 1, with a source telling PEOPLE earlier this month the baby strengthened their bond.\n\nBurak Cingi/Redferns\n\n\u201c[Jenner\u2019s] relationship with Travis couldn\u2019t be stronger. Having a child together really changed their relationship for the better,\u201d the source said about the new mom, who has been dating Scott since April 2017.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kylie Jenner Makes Red Carpet Return at the Met Gala with Travis Scott 3 Months After Welcoming Stormi\n\n\u201cKylie spends so much time with Stormi. She\u2019s super proud to be a new mom and is very hands-on,\u201d the source added. \u201cShe\u2019s more hands-on than he is, but he still definitely does his fair share to help wherever he can.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up with the latest from PEOPLE?

They jetted off to the island nation and checked into the ultra-luxurious Amanyara resort where, just a few weeks ago, her sisters Kim and Kourtney Kardashian enjoyed a vacation.\n\nAn insider previously told PEOPLE in April that Scott has been going the extra mile to be there for the mother of his child.\n\n\u201cHe is an amazing dad and loves spending time with their daughter. He has very much stepped up,\u201d the insider said. \u201cThey are a great family. Kylie is very in love with Travis. They are doing well.\u201d", "images":
