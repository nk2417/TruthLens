The Saturday Night Live star just got two fresh new tattoos, one on his neck, the other on his right thumb, and both appear to be tributes to his new girlfriend.\n\nThe neck tattoo shows a black bunny mask, mirroring the one worn by Grande on the cover of her Dangerous Woman album. The second tattoo, on his thumb, is of her initials, \"AG.\"\n\nPhotos of the tattoos were posted on social media on Saturday by Los Angeles tattoo artist London Reese.\n\n\"We had a good night, somewhere in the hills of Los Angeles,\" Reese wrote on Instagram. \"Pete loves him some Ariana.\"\n\nGrande joins Hillary Clinton in ink form on Davidson's body. He hilariously got a tattoo of the former presidential candidate in December, causing Clinton to respond, \"This makes it significantly less awkward that I've had a Pete Davidson tattoo for years.\"\n\nA day prior to showing off his new tattoos, the 24-year-old comedian opened for Dave Chapelle at the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and an eyewitness tells ET that Grande was in the audience to watch her guy's stand-up routine. While he didn't mention the 24-year-old pop star during his set, Davidson did pose for a photo with his girlfriend backstage, alongside fellow comedian Wil Sylvince.\n\nGrande also posted a sweet photo of her and Davidson together on Instagram earlier this week, which shows him holding her in his arms.\n\nFor more on Grande's recent breakup from rapper Mac Miller, watch the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2023-10/MK-Kat-Von-D-1920-x-800-GALLERY-HERO.jpg?h=f78bc9b2&width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/1280_ariana_grande_pete_davidson.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/1280_ariana_grande_pete_davidson.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-05/ariana_getty954422104.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-05/et_050118_arianaonfallonvp.png?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-05/1280-gettyimages-624767084.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/1280_ariana_grande_pete_davidson.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/pete-davidson-gets-2-ariana-grande-tribute-tattoos-after-confirming-relationship-103419", "title": "Pete Davidson Gets Two Ariana Grande Tribute Tattoos After Confirming Relationship", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/1280_ariana_grande_pete_davidson.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The pair went from coyly teasing their relationship to permanent ink in a short amount of time.", "title": "Pete Davidson Gets Two Ariana Grande Tribute Tattoos After Confirming Relationship", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/pete-davidson-gets-2-ariana-grande-tribute-tattoos-after-confirming-relationship-103419", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The pair went from coyly teasing their relationship to permanent ink in a short amount of time.", "twitter": {"description": "The pair went from coyly teasing their relationship to permanent ink in a short amount of time.", "title": "Pete Davidson Gets Two Ariana Grande Tribute Tattoos After Confirming Relationship", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/pete-davidson-gets-2-ariana-grande-tribute-tattoos-after-confirming-relationship-103419", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-05/1280_ariana_grande_pete_davidson.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Pete Davidson Gets Two Ariana Grande Tribute Tattoos After Confirming Relationship | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Pete Davidson, Ariana Grande", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
