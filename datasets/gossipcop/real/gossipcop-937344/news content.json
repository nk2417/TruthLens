As Mendes strummed his acoustic guitar on the plaintive R&B ballad, audience members including Halsey got emotional, with the impact of the soul-stirring chorus going through the roof as the dozen students in \u201cYouth\u201d hoodies flanked the men and raised their voices.\n\nThe crowd rose to its feet when the choir\u2019s voices leaned into the refrain, with the students directly impacted by gun violence vowing to stay strong and crowding onto the stage around Mendes and Khalid as they soaked in the love from the star-packed arena.\n\nThe performance was introduced by Bebe Rexha, who said, \u201cLast Friday, we experienced another tragedy, this time at Santa Fe High School in Texas. Just a few weeks, ago many students from the very high school joined the protest against gun violence. And they\u2019re no different than tens of thousands of young adults across this nation who took a stand and are raising their voices to say: things must change. They inspire me with their hope, with their compassion and with their determination to make a difference and build a better world.\u201d\n\nWatch Mendes and Khalid\u2019s performance above.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-marjory-stoneman-douglas-hs-bbmas-live-show-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "http://static.billboard.com/files/media/2018-BBMAs-recirc.png", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-marjory-stoneman-douglas-hs-bbmas-live-show-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gil Kaufman", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/shawn-mendes-khalid-perform-youth-billboard-music-awards-2018-video-8456921/", "title": "Shawn Mendes & Khalid Put on Powerful Performance of \u2018Youth\u2019 at the Billboard Music Awards 2018: Watch", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Taking the stage for the second time on Sunday night (May 20) at the Billboard Music Awards, Shawn Mendes paid emotional tribute to the victims of gun violence with a moving performance of his track &quot;Youth&quot; featuring Khalid and the show choir from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Gil Kaufman", "tags": "BBMA, BBMAs, bbnews", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Shawn Mendes & Khalid Put on Powerful Performance of \u2018Youth\u2019 at the Billboard Music Awards 2018: Watch", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/shawn-mendes-khalid-perform-youth-billboard-music-awards-2018-video-8456921/", "description": "Taking the stage for the second time on Sunday night (May 20) at the Billboard Music Awards, Shawn Mendes paid emotional tribute to the victims of gun violence with a moving performance of his track \"Youth\" featuring Khalid and the show choir from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-marjory-stoneman-douglas-hs-bbmas-live-show-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Khalid & Shawn Mendes"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-21T02:10:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-21T02:18:39+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Taking the stage for the second time on Sunday night (May 20) at the Billboard Music Awards, Shawn Mendes paid emotional tribute to the victims of gun violence with a moving performance of his track \"Youth\" featuring Khalid and the show choir from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Shawn Mendes & Khalid Put on Powerful Performance of \u2018Youth\u2019 at the Billboard Music Awards 2018: Watch", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/khalid-shawn-mendes-marjory-stoneman-douglas-hs-bbmas-live-show-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526868640.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
