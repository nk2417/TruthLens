running errands, grocery shopping and washing laundry, then we have the cure: John Legend\u2019s super-smooth and super-sexy vocals.\n\nJohn Legend appeared on \u2018The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u2019 to discuss his \u2018Darkness and Light\u2019 tour (Photo: Tom Dymond/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nThe swoon-worthy singer appeared on \u2018The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u2019 earlier this week to promote his new tour, \u2018Darkness and Light\u2019, which is touring in the UK this September.\n\nBut, being the gentleman that he is, John also treated the audience to renditions of a few non-traditional tunes in a segment called, \u2018John Legend Makes Mundane Things Sound Sexy.\u2019\n\nTV host Stephen Colbert challenged the Grammy Award-winner to sing about the humdrum things in life (Photo: CBS)\n\n\u201cI bet you could make anything, no matter how mundane, sound sexy,\u201d Stephen challenged the star.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement

running out to the Costco,\u201d the ten-time Grammy Award-winner sang. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as too many paper towels.\u201d And at this point, we were wondering whether John Legend had ever been more relatable.\n\nJohn sat down at the piano to serenade the audience with some extremely relatable lyrics (Photo: CBS)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty sexy,\u201d he quipped. \u201cI like that.\u201d\n\nThankfully, he wasn\u2019t finished.\n\n\u201cBaby, my beige turtleneck is pilling, so please wash it inside out,\u201d he continued. \u201cTumble dry, tumble dry, tumble dry low.\u201d\n\nPhew, we\u2019re feeling a little hot under our beige turtleneck collar.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\n\u2018The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u2019
