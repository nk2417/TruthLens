Don't worry, June \u2014 it's only Nick (Max Minghella). Seriously, how can this guy travel so freely? June announces she's breaking free. No way can she stay in the slaughterhouse, and wait on Mayday \u2013 whoever they might be \u2014 to transport her. June tries to talk Nick into running on their own, and rescuing Hannah, too, while they\u2019re at it. Nick assumes the role of Mr. \u201cLet\u2019s Get Back To Reality,\u201d and tells June her plan is impossible. But when June snatches the keys to his car, Nick gives her his gun as if he\u2019s giving her a blessing. Ultimately, once she gets in the car, June\u2019s unable to actually leave. Even in a car, that persistent American symbol of mobility and freedom, June knows she\u2019s trapped and reliant on Mayday\u2019s help. So, she returns to the warehouse, and takes out her emotions \u2014 the thrill of being alive, of being almost free \u2014 by having loads of sex all over the warehouse with Nick.", "images": ["https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d68e2ddc49f6065953daf57eac5b849a.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/b3658fb2d9482c50df8996241fb2b67d.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/9aa89696be7da8b249e2ee2622a111e9.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/1ce585852b9e9a8cba36762b911e0f5f.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/cda4774d79df76d9c5ab2dfba3784155.png", "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/bc2/0,381,2359,1238/x,80/1956570/image.jpg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/90e3b0501ff143bd058ecb3f754a4430.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/c5a8ae3dd50e6ebe17044593c2c7ee0c.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/6a9d712b4b1480df334054a94146cc34.png"], "top_img": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/bc2/0,381,2359,1238/x,80/1956570/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Newman-B...", "Rachel Choy", "Taryn Finley", "Alicia Lansom", "Banseka Kayembe", "Tess Garcia", "Handmaids Tale Season Episode Recap Unwomen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/04/197034/handmaids-tale-recap-season-2-episode-2", "title": "Handmaids Tale Season 2 Episode 2 Recap Unwomen", "meta_data": {"title": "Handmaids Tale Season 2 Episode 2 Recap Unwomen", "description": "In this episode, two major mysteries are revealed: What the heck goes on in the colonies?
