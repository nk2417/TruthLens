They were together to celebrate the 11th birthday of Glanville\u2019s son Jake, who she shares with Rimes\u2019 now-husband Eddie Cibrian.\n\n\n\n\u201cPeace in #calabasturd hanging for Jakes bday,\u201d Glanville captioned the photo on Instagram Saturday.\n\nThe 35-year-old country singer posted a throwback photo of Jake to celebrate the boy\u2019s birthday but did not repost the selfie with Glanville.\n\nThe women haven\u2019t been on great terms since Cibrian cheated on Glanville with Rimes in 2009. Rimes was married to Dean Sheremet at the time.\n\nRimes and Cibrian left their spouses and got married in 2011.\n\nThe \u201cReal Housewives\u201d star told E! News\u2019 \u201cDaily Pop\u201d last June that she believes Cibrian will leave Rimes in the near future. Glanville also admitted her relationship with her ex-husband was \u201ca little rocky\u201d at the time.\n\nGlanville also admitted she was immature following the cheating scandal.\n\n\u201cI think that I\u2019ve acted like a child enough during the seven years,\u201d she told People in 2016. \u201cAs the kids are getting older \u2013 something did happen with one of them, and I don\u2019t really want to go into it, but it made the three of us, Eddie, LeAnn and myself, realize we have to be together on this.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20181002041934im_/https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/340/340/i-6nn3jxm-l.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181002041934im_/https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/270/152/Kanye20West.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181002041934im_/https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/10/270/152/Andrews-Hathaway-Getty-2018.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181002041934im_/https://a57.foxnews.com///static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/bg/270/152/default.png?ve=1&tl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181002041934im_/https://a57.foxnews.com///a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/1862/1048/c4b4528e-untitled-design.jpg?ve=1&tl=1?ve=1&tl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181002041934im_/https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/270/152/milanocover.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181002041934im_/https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/c4b4528e-untitled-design.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181002041934im_/https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/c4b4528e-untitled-design.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Lam", "Katherine Lam Is A Breaking", "Trending News Digital Producer For Fox News.
