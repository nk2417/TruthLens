We do this show with you foremost in our minds and hearts.\u201d\n\nOn Monday\u2019s anniversary of the Route 91 Music Festival shooting that killed 58 people and injured 851, country star Jason Aldean, who performed at the time of the shooting, also paid tribute to those involved in the tragedy with a #VegasStrong tweet.\n\nHe recently returned to the site of the shooting for the first time to perform.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of myself and my family and the country music community, I want to say thank you to the city of Las Vegas for your courage, strength and kindness,\u201d Aldean said during the performance, via Rolling Stone. \u201cTonight we are all proud to be Vegas strong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a day that\u2019s hard to forget. We know it\u2019s coming up,\u201d he said later to reporters. \u201cTo be back in Vegas this close to it is, at times, a little weird, but in another sense it\u2019s nice to be back. It\u2019s really our first performance we\u2019ve had since then, so tonight is going to be another step in getting through all that stuff, and coming back here is going to be a big part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery night in our meet-and-greets we\u2019re meeting fans that were here at that show, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a show this year that we haven\u2019t had survivors come out to the show,\u201d he added. \u201cWe do that on a daily basis, not just because the anniversary is coming up.\u201d\n\nImagine Dragons also paid tribute to the massacre last month during the 2018 iHeartRadio Music Festival, which took place in Las Vegas.\n\n\u201cI can tell you, this city means everything to me and to this band. We try every day to be honorable to it, to represent it in a way that is true to the Vegas that we love,\u201d said Imagine Dragons frontman and Las Vegas native Dan Reynolds, said. \u201cWe have come together in a way that I\u2019ve always hoped since I was a little kid. I\u2019ve never felt like we had the culture here. I knew the people were here, but it seemed like we just didn\u2019t have something to connect us. And there\u2019s been a lot that\u2019s connected us in this last year.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd even though I\u2019ve been overseas, to come home to the Las Vegas that I know and love, I love this city,\u201d Reynolds said between cheers. \u201cAnd to all of those who we lost, we\u2019re thinking of you. To the families affected, we love you. Vegas Strong.\u201d\n\nDancing With the Stars airs Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\nPhoto Credit: ABC", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/zach-bryan.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-lainey-wilson-devlin-hodges-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Rumer", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/news/dancing-with-the-stars-paid-tribute-las-vegas-shooting/", "title": "How \u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019 Paid Tribute to Las Vegas Shooting Victims", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How 'Dancing With the Stars' Paid Tribute to Las Vegas Shooting Victims", "description": "Dancing With the Stars took an emotional moment to honor the victims of the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting during Tuesday\u2019s Vegas-themed episode of the ABC competition.
