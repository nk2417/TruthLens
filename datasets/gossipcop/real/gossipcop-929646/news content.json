She appeared before Magistrate Judge Viktor V. Pohorelsky at the Brooklyn courthouse in New York\u2019s Eastern District.\n\nThe expectation is that Mack is cutting a deal with prosecutors to provide information against Nxivm founder Keith Raniere, who was arrested last month in Mexico and remains in federal custody. A bail hearing for Raniere is set for next week.\n\nHer mother, Melinda Mack, was in court and put up her home in Los Alamitos, Calif. as collateral for the bail, in addition to property and a bank account owned by Allison Mack.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe actress accused of helping run a secretive sex cult appeared in court in gray-green jail scrubs. She spoke softly in court and did not appear to make eye contact with her mother during the hearing. After standing before the judge to sign the bond, Melinda Mack turned her head to watch her daughter being led out of the courtroom.\n\nMack was not handcuffed but she kept her hands clasped behind her back during the 15-minute hearing. The petite 35-year-old said few words and stayed grim-faced but nodded repeatedly.
