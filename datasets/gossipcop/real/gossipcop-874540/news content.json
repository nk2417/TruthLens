News, the man\u2019s name is Andrew Glennon, and the new couple met while Portwood and Baier were filming Marriage Boot Camp.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\nA source revealed that Baier and Portwood called their relationship off during production of the reality series.

I\u2019m 27\u2026that\u2019s perfect to me and that\u2019s all that matters,\u201dPortwood tweeted.\n\nSo how did this new coupling come about? Scroll down for more details on their blossoming relationship.\n\nThe couple grew close on \u2018Marriage Boot Camp\u2019\n\nA source said Glennon was working as a crew member on Marriage Boot Camp when he first crossed paths with Portwood.\n\n\u201cIt makes sense Amber and Andrew grew close during filming. Her relationship with Matt was in bad shape and when you\u2019re shooting a show like this where there is a lot of heightened emotion, participants bond with the crew,\u201d an insider said.\n\nThey didn\u2019t pursue their romance until after production wrapped.\n\nA post shared by Amber Leann Portwood (@realamberlportwood1__) on Aug 17, 2017 at 1:14am PDT\n\nDespite the timing of their meeting, a source said everything was done correctly between the MTV reality regular and her new beau.\n\nThe source insisted that lines weren\u2019t crossed and \u201cnothing happened\u201d between Portwood and Glennon until she got back home.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t cheat,\u201d the insider said.\n\nPortwood is seemingly open with her romance now, even posting an Instagram photo \u2014 sans caption \u2014 of someone who appears to be her new man.\n\nHe\u2019s not her usual type\u2026\n\nA post shared by Andrew Glennon (@andrew.glennon) on May 20, 2016 at 3:05pm PDT\n\nIn an unverified Instagram account with Glennon\u2019s name \u2014 that Portwood follows \u2014 his dark hair and his beard seems to match the man Portwood was pictured cuddling with.\n\n\u201cAndrew is a bit nerdy,\u201d a source said, \u201cbut she likes that about him. She sounds very happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really tall, well over 6 ft., which Amber loves,\u201d the source continued.\n\nFormer flame Matt Baier, on the other hand, seemed to be on the shorter side.\n\nThey\u2019re nearly inseparable\u2026\n\n\u201cDuring filming, Andrew noticed Amber before she noticed him. He contacted her once filming ended. She and Matt were broken up and she invited him to come visit,\u201d a source shared.\n\nIt sounds like these two could be the real deal!\n\nGlennon arrived a \u201cfew weeks later\u201d and \u201che\u2019s been with her ever since. It\u2019s been a longer stay than either of them expected.\u201d\n\nGlennon has a background in the entertainment industry\u2026\n\nGlennon comes from Malibu, California. According to an IMDb page that\u2019s linked to his name, the 33-year-old has worked in production for awhile, including jobs in the camera department and as a cinematographer for a few short films and other similar independent projects.\n\nBecause of his job, he\u2019s reportedly \u201cgig to gig\u201d and has the time right now to be in Indianapolis with Portwood.\n\nWhat do you think of Portwood\u2019s new romance?", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/zach-bryan.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-lainey-wilson-devlin-hodges-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/the-real-housewives-of-orange-county-logo-1.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Olivia Rowe", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/teen-mom-amber-portwood-new-boyfriend-andrew-glennon/", "title": "5 Things to Know About Amber Portwood\u2019s New Boyfriend", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "5 Things to Know About Amber Portwood's New Boyfriend", "description": "After splitting with longtime beau Matt Baier after a series of ups and downs documented on Teen Mom OG, it seems like Amber Portwood is trying love out again.
