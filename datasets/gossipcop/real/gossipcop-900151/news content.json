He added of his bullies: \u201cWhy do you bully? What\u2019s the point of it? It makes me feel awful.\u201d\n\nThis Morning/ITV\n\nKimberly said that Keaton expressed that he didn\u2019t want to return even to the middle school even \u201cwhen the whole world wanted to come and eat lunch with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve struggled anyway especially being this close to Christmas break, but after seeing how big it got, I mean it just seems like maybe we should let it die down a little bit before we made any decisions so that we could kind of have a reality of what life is gonna be like,\u201d she continued.\n\nLove What Matters/Facebook\n\nKeaton, of Knoxville, captivated the Internet earlier this month after a video uploaded by his mother showed the boy in tears as he lamented the bullying he\u2019s endured at school. In the video, Keaton revealed that the bullies, \u201cmake fun of my nose. They call me ugly. They say I have no friends.\u201d\n\nHowever, Keaton\u2019s emotional story took a turn when photos surfaced showing the family with Confederate flags. They faced more criticism when rumors circulated that the family used Keaton\u2019s story for financial gain.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said over and over, I\u2019m an adult, I know who I am. I\u2019m obviously sorry that it has offended so many people, but the backlash to my children\u2026\u201d Kimberly said during the morning show. \u201cThat\u2019s something I wouldn\u2019t wish on anybody.\u201d\n\nShe added that the backlash has \u201cbrought the bullies out.\u201d Kimberly also denied being racist in interviews with ABC and CBS News.\n\nAs the backlash seemingly began to subside, the family faced a new wave of criticism as photos from the Facebook page of Shawn White, Keaton\u2019s allegedly estranged father, showed him sharing white supremacist propaganda. The pictures prompted Keaton\u2019s older sister, Lakyn Jones, to defend her family in a tweet.\n\nHenry Winkler Offers a Powerful Message Following Tennessee Student\u2019s Viral Anti-Bullying Video\n\n\u201cYou all can go look back at every tweet from every father\u2019s & mother\u2019s day to see that all we have is our mom,\u201d Lakyn wrote on her Twitter account on Wednesday. \u201cWe have no contact with our dads. BECAUSE of their actions. That\u2019s why all the articles say \u2018estranged\u2019 because we don\u2019t talk to them. Leave us alone.\u201d\n\nFamily friend Kaley Katz worked to shut down the criticism, telling PEOPLE that the accusations of racism are \u201crumors\u201d and that it\u2019s not true that Keaton is the target of bullying because he used a racial slur.\n\n\u201cThe rumors are fake,\u201d family friend Kaley Katz tells PEOPLE. \u201cShe is not a racist, Keaton did not bully anyone at his school, and she did not start the GoFundMe account in order for it to be a scam.\u201d", "images":
