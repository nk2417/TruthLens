She said she\u2019d wanted to wear her hair in braids as first lady, but decided against it, because she felt that America wasn\u2019t \u201cready,\u201d and that there would be too much unnecessary focus on her hair and not on husband President Barack Obama\u2019s policy. But Tuesday night on the political main stage, she made sure America was ready to see and hear her.\n\nOn night two of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Michelle Obama came to play. With her longtime stylist Meredith Koop, she chose a deconstructed navy suit from the American brand Monse, helmed by Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia, who are also the creative directors of Oscar de la Renta. She accessorized with a pair of Jimmy Choo kitten heels, a belt, hoop earrings, and fingers full of silver rings, her hair braided and tied back into a ponytail.\n\nThe look was fierce but also sophisticated and, somehow, on her, effortless, even with a belted waist and asymmetrical tailoring. It was defiant in its subversion of the typical politico-style suiting, quite literally a reworked classic jacket with crisscrossed lapels and a cinched waist that was, perhaps symbolically so, also sleeveless. Let\u2019s not forget that one of the harshest, most ridiculous critiques of Obama\u2019s style when she and Barack were in the White House came when she wore sleeveless dresses and tops out in public and on official business. The press talked about how it was crass or disrespectful for a FLOTUS to show her arms. Many times, people wrote about how muscular hers looked.\n\nMuch of Obama\u2019s passionate speech supporting Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, in fact, was about flipping the proverbial middle finger to those who have tried to place her, and all Black women, into a box of their bigoted choosing. It balanced harsh reality with enduring optimism. Pointed-but-intelligent jabs were genius, too\u2014as one meme put it: \u201cMichelle Obama 2016: When they go low, we go high. Michelle Obama 2024: Fuuuuuuuuck that.\u201d She spoke about believing in hope despite so much darkness, the importance of hard work, and why \u201cnobody has a monopoly on what it means to be an American.\u201d But she really hit the nail on the Oompa Loompa\u2013colored head with one perfect swipe. Calling back to Republican nominee and former president Donald Trump\u2019s comment in June that immigrants were taking away \u201cBlack jobs\u201d and \u201cHispanic jobs,\u201d Obama said in a sardonic tone, \u201cI want to know: Who\u2019s gonna tell him that the job he\u2019s currently seeking might just be one of those Black jobs?\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nBoom. LFG. Obama has always been a master with words, but this moment felt decidedly more direct and a bit rebellious, sentiments that are sorely needed for an election in which we don\u2019t have the time to be too polite. The stakes are just too dire, so Obama delivered a call to action that was as much grace, humility, and hope as it was audacious and unapologetically frank. The visual of her dressed boldly but like herself, hair braided, is an important marker of where we should be now and where we\u2019re hopefully going come November. Her incomparable ability to crystalize a divided political moment and rally a nation behind doing the right thing is always underscored by her strong sense of style and her cheeky, clever ability to always have a little fun too.\n\nA little defiance is a good thing right now, whether it\u2019s in the way Democrats speak to the opposing side or in the ways that our politicians, both men and women, dress to carry out their political work. Even in Harris\u2019s own choice of sharp, straightforward suits, we can see a different kind of push against the norm, against the people who think she should look a certain way or dress a certain way, more traditionally, as the nominee. Her style is wholly hers, and it is simply about getting to work, doing a job, and wearing clothes that she feels as comfortable and confident in as she always has, whether that means Converse kicks, Chlo\u00e9 suits, or a pair of leggings. For Obama, defiance is dressed in a chic little heel and cool, crisscrossed lapels. She and Harris\u2014two women who genuinely love fashion\u2014show up to inspire with both words and looks.\n\nAs Obama noted when discussing the similarities between her own late mother and Harris\u2019s: \u201cDon\u2019t sit around and complain about things. Do something.\u201d Yes we can\u2014in a suit with or without sleeves.", "images":
