We\u2019ve had to deal with this, obviously in our family,\u201d Jenner said. \u201cRob was stupid for doing that. He kind of apologized.\u201d\n\nJenner clarified that he has not had much of a relationship with Kardashian, 30, in recent years, though. \u201cI\u2019ve never met Blac Chyna, never met the kid [Dream Kardashian]. Rob, I haven\u2019t really haven\u2019t had a serious conversation with in years,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve kind of been out of that scene, so I really can\u2019t comment on what\u2019s going on there.\u201d (The rest of the Kardashians have also distanced themselves from Jenner after the former Olympian made damaging claims in her memoir about ex-wife Kris Jenner.)\n\nRelated: Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna\u2019s Cutest Moments Click through to relive Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna's whirlwind, headline-making romance\n\nWhen asked by the View cohosts if she was surprised by Kardashian\u2019s actions, the former decathlete replied, \u201cGuys \u2014 I know because I used to be over on that team \u2014 can be really stupid and do stupid things. I\u2019ve tried to warn my kids \u2014 all of them, I\u2019ve got a lot of kids \u2014 you\u2019ve got to pick your friends, and it\u2019s hard to do. You can be tremendously deceived, and it\u2019s not your fault, but you have to pick your friends wisely.\u201d\n\nThe Arthur George sock designer could be facing legal trouble after he went on an explosive social media tirade on July 5, in which he claimed the 29-year-old model cheated on him and that he paid for her bills, cars, jewelry and weight-loss surgeries. He also posted several nude photos of Chyna on Instagram and Twitter.\n\nRelated: Stars at Court Chris Brown isn't the only celeb who has faced a judge.

That same week, a source told Us Weekly that the exes \u201chaven\u2019t spoken\u201d since the social media war. As long as Rob obeys the order of protection, Chyna won\u2019t pursue a criminal investigation, Bloom told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cFor now, Chyna has said she does not want to go to the police or pursue the criminal route,\u201d Bloom told the outlet.\n\nIf Chyna changes her mind, however, sexual privacy attorney and expert Carrie Goldberg told Us that Kardashian could face major consequences for sharing naked photos without his ex\u2019s consent. \u201cIt is a misdemeanor and it is punishable by up to six months in jail and then also a fine,\u201d Goldberg told Us, adding that Chyna could also sue her former Rob & Chyna costar for financial damages.\n\nSince the incident, Kardashian has apologized. His actions \u201cwere a spontaneous reaction that he regrets,\u201d his attorney Robert Shapiro told TMZ on Monday. \u201cRob\u2019s only concern is for the well-being of baby Dream.\u201d",
