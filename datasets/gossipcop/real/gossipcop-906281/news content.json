Cast members Cecily Strong and Mikey Day seemed surprised, but kept the action going. Some people watching the show in Los Angeles and Las Vegas reported on Twitter that NBC bleeped out the profanity, and Rick Ludwin, a former longtime head of NBC\u2019s late-night programming, said on the social-media outlet that the network delays its west coast feed by a few seconds. NBC has broadcast \u201cSNL\u201d live across the nation since mid-Spring.\n\nAn \u201cSNL\u201d spokeswoman said producers declined to comment on the incident.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nRockwell\u2019s utterance threatened to distract from a strong broadcast of the program that featured cameos from former cast members Bill Murray and Fred Armisen, as well as a strong opening sketch that made fun of MSNBC morning hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. And viewers heard other bits of profanity during the program: During \u201cWeekend Update,\u201d co-anchor Colin Jost repeated the word \u201cs\u2014hole\u201d that has become an integral part of the recent news cycle after reports surfaced stating President Trump used the phrase to describe certain foreign countries. NBC bleeped out that word on the west coast as well.\n\nIn an era when TV viewers routinely hear Samantha Bee utter all kinds of profanity on basic-cable\u2019s TBS and listen to all sorts of once-offensive language on networks ranging from FX to HBO, who cares if someone drops a discouraging word on \u201cSNL\u201d? Simply put, the show airs on broadcast TV, and is held to a different standard by the Federal Communications Commission. What\u2019s more, uttering profanity on the venerable series over its past four-plus decades on air has not often been rewarded.\n\nIn February, 1981, cast member Charles Rocket improvised a response to host Charlene Tilton that included the word \u201cf\u2013k,\u201d and the incident that went down in infamy. Rocket was taken off the program. Featured player Jenny Slate inadvertently used a variation of that same word in her debut on the program in September of 2009. While she had a strong first year, and even established herself with a recurring character, she did not return to the program in its next season.\n\nBoth of those mishaps took place well after midnight. Last season, actress Kristen Stewart uttered the word in the midst of her monologue on a broadcast in February of last year. Norm MacDonald and Paul Shaffer are among others who have thrown the word out while on the air.\n\nAt least one person who swore on a live \u201cSNL\u201d telecast escaped punishment. In 1995, cast member Cheri Oteri uttered the word \u201cs\u2013t\u201d while playing irascible character Rita DelVecchio. Host David Schwimmer called attention to the mistake during the episode\u2019s farewell moments, and Oteri placed some money in a \u201cswear jar.\u201d All was forgiven. Oteri stayed with the program until 2000.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sam-rockwell.jpg?w=826&h=464&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sam-rockwell.jpg?w=826&h=464&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Steinberg", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/sam-rockwell-drops-f-bomb-snl-1202664138/", "title": "Sam Rockwell Drops Surprise \u2018F-Bomb\u2019 on \u2018SNL\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Sam Rockwell Drops \u2018F-Bomb\u2019 on SNL", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Brian Steinberg", "tags": "NBC, Sam Rockwell, Saturday Night Live", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Sam Rockwell Drops Surprise \u2018F-Bomb\u2019 on \u2018SNL\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/sam-rockwell-drops-f-bomb-snl-1202664138/", "description": "Sam Rockwell Drops \u2018F-Bomb\u2019 on SNL", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sam-rockwell.jpg?w=826&h=464&crop=1", "width": 826, "height": 464, "alt": "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE -- \"Sam Rockwell\" Episode 1735 -- Pictured: Host Sam Rockwell during a promo in 30 Rockefeller Plaza -- (Photo by: Rosalind O'Connor/NBC)"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-14T05:43:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-15T16:43:30+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sam Rockwell Drops \u2018F-Bomb\u2019 on SNL", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@bristei", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sam Rockwell Drops Surprise \u2018F-Bomb\u2019 on \u2018SNL\u2019", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/sam-rockwell.jpg?w=826&h=464&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515908628.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
