Brown threw her cup of water at Cowell in response and left the studio in the middle of the episode, which was filming live. She later returned after a commercial break.\n\n\u201cHe should know if you say something inappropriate he\u2019s gonna, like, get stuff thrown at him. In a friendly way. I made sure there was no ice in it this time,\u201d said Brown, who has thrown water at Cowell before. \u201cI told him he was an a\u2013hole and that was it, and he goes, \u2018Oh, whatever.'\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBrown was previously ordered to pay Belafonte $400,000 per month in spousal support. She is currently filing for joint legal and physical custody of their 5-year-old daughter and for the court to terminate the spousal support order.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://source.unsplash.com/random/595x333", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mel-b-agt.jpg?w=865&h=487&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mel-b-agt.jpg?w=865&h=487&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matt Fernandez", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/mel-b-throws-water-simon-cowell-comment-referencing-divorce-1202537553/", "title": "Mel B Throws Water at Simon Cowell, Walks Off \u2018America\u2019s Got Talent\u2019 Stage After Wedding Joke", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Mel B throws her water at fellow \"America's Got Talent\" judge Simon Cowell makes a comment referencing her divorce.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Matt Fernandez", "tags": "America's Got Talent, Mel B, Simon Cowell", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Mel B Throws Water at Simon Cowell, Walks Off \u2018America\u2019s Got Talent\u2019 Stage After Wedding Joke", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/mel-b-throws-water-simon-cowell-comment-referencing-divorce-1202537553/", "description": "Mel B throws her water at fellow \"America's Got Talent\" judge Simon Cowell makes a comment referencing her divorce.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mel-b-agt.jpg?w=865&h=487&crop=1", "width": 865, "height": 487, "alt": "Mel B AGT"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-24T00:30:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-24T05:41:23+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mel B throws her water at fellow \"America's Got Talent\" judge Simon Cowell makes a comment referencing her divorce.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@matt_fern", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mel B Throws Water at Simon Cowell, Walks Off \u2018America\u2019s Got Talent\u2019 Stage After Wedding Joke", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mel-b-agt.jpg?w=865&h=487&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503534625.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
