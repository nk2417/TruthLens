Per several outlets, though originating with a Hello! report, Harry \u201ctried to maintain a low profile\u201d as he stopped by the set of Suits to see Markle in action. \u201cHe was super low-key, met some crew, and was so happy to watch his lady,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe\u2019s incredibly supportive of her work.\u201d Markle reportedly gave Harry a tour of the set, as well. (We very much want to believe Harry filmed a cameo for an upcoming Suits episode, as well, as a British lawyer on a transfer or the posh cousin of a client, or such.)\n\nHarry will remain in Toronto until Saturday, so it\u2019s very possible we are in for additional sightings and appearances for the couple, though they are also quite well-practiced at this point in doing so without being caught by photographers or otherwise creating any commotion. Though that does not mean they aren\u2019t able to carve out moments of romance when out together: royal reporter Patricia Treble noted that, on Saturday at the opening ceremony, when everyone in the audience had their eyes on the stage for the rendition of \u201cO Canada,\u201d Prince Harry \u201cturned his head and looked at Meghan Markle\u201d from across the section between them in the crowd. Treble noted, \u201cHe took advantage of a rare moment out of the spotlight. It lasted a good 10 seconds. She didn\u2019t notice. Yup, he\u2019s in love.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69138dc2108d96082627c8f5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cfb5b809be4a2d59908bf6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-invictus-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598b8ea8c676fe5242b39aed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Meghan-Prince-Harry.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598b8ea8c676fe5242b39aed/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Meghan-Prince-Harry.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fa686659389b4cea701e19/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6900e724719651cf92568024/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cfb5b609c9fb75e7139b74/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-invictus-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59cfb5b58ec2206eb700440a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-invictus-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69134e1408e5ee77e37d2651/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691505934f93271855d8a78a/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e55b2c48e51f42566b396/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6901026c7b6db29214cd9d68/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690bcf4cd862d6f327955a94/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e0661d7f7e7718194d67e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6919bbed01714426f5a0dc01/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690a2457c9b01443eb632273/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69177930e84ad375fd84ec60/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54d3a8f99f9fa5f230b14590/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598b8ea8c676fe5242b39aed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Meghan-Prince-Harry.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Josh Duboff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/09/prince-harry-meghan-markle-suits-set-visit-toronto", "title": "Prince Harry Visited Meghan Markle on the Set of Suits in Toronto", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Josh Duboff", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "The trip to set took place before Markle attended Harry\u2019s Invictus Games.", "id": "59c9064adf32637fb2b91fe8", "keywords": "meghan markle,prince harry,royals", "news_keywords": "meghan markle,prince harry,royals", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59c9064adf32637fb2b91fe8", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The trip to set took place before Markle attended Harry\u2019s Invictus Games.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598b8ea8c676fe5242b39aed/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Meghan-Prince-Harry.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598b8ea8c676fe5242b39aed/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Meghan-Prince-Harry.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The trip to set took place before Markle attended Harry\u2019s Invictus Games.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598b8ea8c676fe5242b39aed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Meghan-Prince-Harry.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Prince Harry Visited Meghan Markle on the Set of \u201cSuits\u201d in Toronto", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/09/prince-harry-meghan-markle-suits-set-visit-toronto"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-09-25T13:39:35.441Z", "modified_time": "2017-09-25T13:39:35.441Z", "author": "Josh Duboff"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The trip to set took place before Markle attended Harry\u2019s Invictus Games.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598b8ea8c676fe5242b39aed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Meghan-Prince-Harry.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Prince Harry Visited Meghan Markle on the Set of \u201cSuits\u201d in Toronto"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598b8ea8c676fe5242b39aed/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/Meghan-Prince-Harry.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google": "nopagereadaloud", "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506346775.441, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
