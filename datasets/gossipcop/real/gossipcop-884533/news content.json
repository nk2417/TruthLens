Like, there\u2019s even been drama about how there is \u201cno drama.\u201d And while no one but the cast knows what actually went down behind the scenes, at some point the internet decided Kim Cattrall and Sarah Jessica Parker were feuding. And thanks to Kim filming a cameo for the second season of And Just Like That\u2026 (without seeing\u2026literally any of her costars), the actors\u2019 alleged \u201cfeud\u201d has once again become a talking point.\n\nBy way of a little background, it\u2019s important to note that there was a pretty major pay disparity among the Sex and the City cast: Sarah Jessica Parker earned a much larger salary than her costars due to being the show\u2019s lead (as well as a producer). Kim wanted more money as the show became more successful, and negotiations between her and the producers took a turn for the very public\u2014and the very yikes. Which brings us to our timeline, ahem!\n\nSeptember 19, 2004\n\nAfter SATC ends its run on HBO, the cast heads to the Emmys and everyone is quick to notice that Kim doesn\u2019t sit with her costars.\n\nGetty Images\n\nNovember 12, 2004\n\nDuring an interview on Friday Night With Jonathan Ross, Kim says that salary discrepancies did, indeed, impact the show ending when it did. \u201cI felt after six years, it was time for all of us to participate in the financial windfall of Sex and the City. When they didn\u2019t seem keen on that, I thought it was time to move on.\u201d\n\nMay 19, 2008\n\nFour years after the series finale, the SATC movie starts filming\u2014after allegedly being delayed due to Kim\u2019s salary negotiations. Sucks for fans, but seems fair, IMO. Sarah Jessica Parker even supports Kim, telling The Telegraph, \u201cShe mentioned money and no one should vilify her for it. People made a decision that we had vilified her.\u201d\n\nIn the same interview, Kim talks about the filming holdup and says, \u201cI was going through a divorce and my job of seven years was coming to an end. Then my dad was diagnosed with dementia. So I took a step back and returned to Canada, where my family is\u2014that\u2019s the reason behind it. It wasn\u2019t all about the money.\u201d\n\nNovember 5, 2009\n\nWhile filming SATC 2, Sarah Jessica Parker covers Elle and says, \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody wants to believe that I love Kim. I adore her. I wouldn\u2019t have done the movie without her. Didn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\n\nJanuary 8, 2010\n\nKim denies feud rumors in an interview with the Daily Mail:\n\n\u201cI think Sarah was right: People don\u2019t want to believe that we get on. They have too much invested in the idea of two strong, successful women fighting with each other. It makes for juicy gossip and copy. The truth of us being friends and getting along and happily doing our jobs together is nowhere near as newsworthy. I think Sarah is fantastic. She is a born leader and she guides the crew and the cast in such a strong but gentle way. She and I are sick of this. It\u2019s exhausting talking about it and a real bore. Next?\u201d\n\nMay 5, 2010\n\nThe cast covers Marie Claire ahead of Sex and the City 2 and continues to shut down feud rumors. SJP put it this way:\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re on set, you\u2019re working 90-hour weeks, you\u2019re never home, you\u2019re exhausted. There are times when all of us have been sensitive, and sometimes feelings get hurt. But I don\u2019t have any regrets about how I\u2019ve treated people.\u201d\n\nDave M. Benett // Getty Images\n\nAugust 21, 2016\n\nSJP wishes Kim a happy birthday with a giant photo of her face:\n\nSeptember 28, 2016\n\nSJP tells Time, \u201cIt was always so heartbreaking to me that there was this narrative about Kim and myself because it just didn\u2019t reflect anything that happened on that set. They just didn\u2019t do it to the Sopranos guys. It was so strange to me and upsetting. I posted something on Kim\u2019s birthday and people were like, \u2018Oh my god, I didn\u2019t know you liked her!\u2019 What? We were all at liberty to walk away at any time! But nobody asked those questions of shows with men. Isn\u2019t that interesting?\u201d\n\nOctober 18, 2016\n\nSJP opens up to Howard Stern, saying, \u201cThis sort of narrative, this ongoing catfight, it really used to upset me. It was usually about bad behavior on the set and I take very seriously my reputation. I work really hard and I treat people well. I have a work ethic that\u2019s very meaningful to me and it\u2019s based on the affection I feel for the people I get to work with. To suggest that I\u2019m behaving poorly or not treating somebody well\u2026it would drive me bananas.\u201d\n\nSeptember 29, 2017\n\nAs news breaks that Sex and the City 3 isn\u2019t happening, Kim shuts down speculation that she was somehow responsible for it:\n\nThat same day, the rest of the cast talks about how disappointed they are that the movie isn\u2019t happening, and things get a little, ahem, pointed:\n\nOctober 7, 2017\n\nThe New York Post publishes an entire article about the \u201cmean girls\u201d culture on the set of Sex and the City. The report includes a bunch of aggregated claims of SJP being \u201cmean\u201d to Kim, including from one source who says, \u201c[Kim] feels she has been treated horribly by Sarah Jessica Parker for six years.\u201d\n\nWhy is this particular tabloid report relevant, you ask? Stay tuned.\n\nOctober 24, 2017\n\nKim responds to speculation that her \u201cdemands\u201d held up the third Sex and the City movie during an interview with Piers Morgan, saying, \u201cWe\u2019ve never been friends. We\u2019ve been colleagues, and in some ways, it\u2019s a very healthy place to be.\u201d\n\nShe also tells Morgan that no one had reached out to her about reports that it was her fault the third movie was canceled: \u201cNobody ever picks up the phone and tries to contact you and say, \u2018How you doing?\u2019 That would have been the way to handle it. This is, it feels like, a toxic relationship.\u201d\n\nFebruary 1, 2018\n\nSJP reacts to Kim\u2019s interview with Morgan, telling Andy Cohen, \u201cI found it very upsetting because that\u2019s not the way I recall our experience. It\u2019s sad, but I always think that what ties us together is this singular experience. It was a professional experience, but it became personal because it was years and years of our lives, so I\u2019m hoping that that sort of eclipses anything that\u2019s been recently spoken.\u201d\n\nFebruary 10, 2018\n\nKim makes it clear she\u2019s not on good terms with SJP, responding to well-wishes about her brother\u2019s sudden passing by writing, \u201cYour continuous reaching out is a painful reminder of how cruel you really were then and now.\u201d She adds, \u201cYou are not my family. You are not my friend. So I\u2019m writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your \u2018nice girl\u2019 persona.\u201d\n\nAs you can see, Kim also includes the literal URL to that 2017 New York Post article about the \u201cmean girl\u201d culture on SATC\u2014indicating that much of it was true, at least according to her.\n\nFebruary 14, 2018\n\nSarah Jessica Parker insists she and Kim Never. Had. Drama. during an interview with People:\n\n\u201cI never talked about it, except [to say] that some of us were disappointed [about the movie not happening]. But I never responded to the conversation Kim had with Piers Morgan, where she said things that were really hurtful about me. We had this experience and it was amazing, and nothing will ever be like it. We had a connection with an audience and we had a connection with the city and with this crew and we got to tell these crazy stories with each other. So I don\u2019t want to mess with that. I couldn\u2019t imagine anyone else playing that part. So there was no fight; it was completely fabricated, because I actually never responded. And I won\u2019t, because she needed to say what she needed to say and that is her privilege.\u201d\n\nFebruary 26, 2018\n\nCynthia Nixon makes it pretty clear how she feels about the situation with an extremely subtle and completely understated Instagram post!\n\nApril 23, 2018\n\nSPJ once again insists that there is no drama to be found, telling Vulture:\n\n\u201cI have never uttered an unkind, unsupportive, unfriendly word, so I would love to redefine it. I also want to remind everybody that there were four women on the set and I spent equal time with all of them, so this was not a set with two women who didn\u2019t get along. I\u2019ve always held Kim\u2019s work in high regard and always appreciative of her contributions. If she chooses not to do the third movie, there\u2019s not a lot I can do to change her mind and we must respect it. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve ever said about it, you know?\u201d\n\nSeptember 17, 2018\n\nFans accuse Kristin Davis of stirring the pot by leaving Kim out of this SATC throwback post:\n\nNovember 19, 2018\n\nProducer/writer Michael Patrick King talks to the Hollywood Reporter about the salary discrepancy on Sex and the City. As he bluntly put it:\n\n\u201cThe show doesn\u2019t exist if Sarah Jessica wasn\u2019t the blonde star of the show, that\u2019s number one. Kim was not at the height of her career, Kristin was under her in terms of notability, Cynthia was a theater actress\u2014and their contracts reflected that status.\u201d\n\nNovember 26, 2018\n\nA source tells E! News that one of the reasons Kim turned down a third movie is that she didn\u2019t like Samantha\u2019s storyline: \u201cKim never wanted to really do the movie to begin with. It was a combination of not great money and a bad storyline for Samantha. It was a bad script.\u201d\n\nJanuary 11, 2021\n\nSJP announces that Sex and the City is coming back to HBO\u2014without Kim.\n\nShe even specifically confirms that Kim won\u2019t be in the show and denies disliking her to a commenter:\n\nInstagram\n\nJanuary 13, 2021\n\nKim Cattrall \u201cbreaks her silence\u201d (kinda) by Liking a pretty pointed tweet about the SATC reboot: \u201cI absolutely love Sex and the City and whilst I am saddened that Samantha will not return, I applaud doing what is best for you and think this is a great example of putting yourself first. Well done, @KimCattrall. \ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\ud83d\udc96\u201d\n\nFebruary 12, 2021\n\nWe learn that Samantha is indeed getting written off the new Sex and the City show, but even though Kim\u2019s exit from the series has been dramatic, Samantha\u2019s won\u2019t be. HBO Max chief content officer Casey Bloys tells TV Line that Samantha will be absent because she simply grew apart from the rest of the crew.\n\n\u201cJust as in real life, people come into your life, people leave,\u201d she says. \u201cFriendships fade, and new friendships start. So I think it is all very indicative of the real stages, the actual stages of life.\u201d\n\nJuly 9, 2021\n\nThe first pics drop from the set of And Just Like That\u2026 with Miranda, Carrie, and Charlotte stylishly strutting down an NYC street\u2014and Samantha is a noticeable absence.\n\nJose Perez/Bauer-Griffin // Getty Images\n\nOctober 2021\n\n\n\nCandace Bushnell speaks to the New York Post about Kim not being a part of the reboot while also mentioning that she didn\u2019t know anything about the reboot\u2019s storyline and doesn\u2019t have any involvement with it. \u201cI absolutely love Kim,\u201d Bushnell says, \u201cbut it seems she wants to do other things and she doesn\u2019t feel like doing the show. Maybe she doesn\u2019t want to be that character anymore. Maybe she doesn\u2019t want to put the Spanx on!\u201d\n\nDecember 2021\n\nKristin speaks with the Today show about whether Kim\u2019s absence will be explained in the reboot, to which the actor replies, \u201cYes. We love Samantha. Samantha is never not going to be a part in some way, right? So there is respect for Samantha. It\u2019s part of the story. We would never disrespect Samantha.\u201d\n\nWhen the show debuts on December 9, viewers learn Samantha\u2019s absence is a result of her moving to London for work after Carrie no longer wants her as a publicist. Subsequently, Samantha stops returning calls and texts from all three of her former friends.\n\nFebruary 2022\n\nIn an interview with Variety, SJP says the following when asked about whether she would want Kim back on the show: \u201cI don\u2019t think I would because I think there\u2019s just too much public history of feelings on her part that she\u2019s shared.\u2026I haven\u2019t participated in or read articles, although people are inclined to let me know.\u201d\n\nCreator Michael Patrick King also adds, \u201cMagically thinking, it\u2019s great to have Samantha. I have no realistic expectation of Kim Cattrall ever appearing again.\u201d\n\nMay 2022\n\nKim\u2019s interview with Variety sets the record straight on how she feels about the original SATC cast reprising their roles on And Just Like That\u2026 without her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s odd, isn\u2019t it? I don\u2019t know how to feel about it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s so finite for me, so it doesn\u2019t continue. I think I would ponder it more if I didn\u2019t have something like Queer as Folk or How I Met Your Father. That\u2019s kind of where I\u2019m centered around. This feels like an echo of the past.\u2026I loved [Samantha]. I loved her so, so, so much. It\u2019s tough competition. The original show is in all of our imaginations. But for me, it feels clean.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether she was ever friends with her SATC costars, Kim adds, \u201cI guess it\u2019s how you define friends. I think we were colleagues. My colleagues aren\u2019t my friends. It was professional.\u201d\n\nMay 31, 2023\n\nVariety drops the bombshell news that Samantha Jones will appear in one scene during the And Just Like That\u2026 season 2 finale\u2014which she filmed \u201cwithout seeing or speaking with the stars of the series, including Sarah Jessica Parker\u201d or even showrunner Michael Patrick King.\n\nJune 4, 2023\n\nEvan Handler confirms Kim\u2019s cameo, saying, \u201cI think it is great. I do. Apparently, [her cameo] was shot in the garage somewhere with no contact with anybody, so the only place I have to welcome her is into my living room when it airs on television.\u201d\n\nJune 9, 2023\n\nKristin Davis is asked if she\u2019s in touch with Kim by The Telegraph and says, \u201cYou have to respect people\u2019s wishes. I\u2019m not gonna waste energy on it. I can\u2019t change anybody. I do understand fans\u2019 feelings\u2014that they\u2019re upset.\u2026I wish I could fix it, but I can\u2019t, it\u2019s not in my power.\u201d\n\nJuly 5, 2023\n\nThis happens, and it's amazing:\n\nAugust 23, 2023\n\nKim FINALLY shows up on SATC for her long-awaited phone call with Carrie (which again, was filmed totally separately).\n\nAnd that brings us up to date! We\u2019ll be updating this if anything else happens, bye!", "images":
