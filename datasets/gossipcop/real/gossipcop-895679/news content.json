Click through to see all the adorable bundle of joys who were born in 2017\n\nEarly on Wednesday \u2014 five days after Zolciak came under fire for telling Brielle to flash a breast on Snapchat \u2014 the 20-year-old took to Twitter with an announcement.\n\n\u201cOMG!!! i\u2019m so excited my mom is PREGNANT with baby number 7!!!! Brielle wrote in a now-deleted tweet. When a fan asked when Zolciak is due, Brielle responded, \u201cin the spring sometime.\u201d\n\nBrielle then shared the news on Instagram with the caption: \u201cOMG!!! i can\u2019t wait to meet the little nugget. it\u2019s been so hard keeping this a secret!!! woo!! #lucky7.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later, Zolciak, 39, shut down the story on Snapchat. \u201cBrielle\u2019s lying!\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s lying!\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not a totally farfetched story. Just last month, Zolciak told Us Weekly that she and NFL husband Kroy Biermann talk about expanding their family.\n\nRelated: Stars Who Got Their Start on Reality TV The road to success in Hollywood is a little different for every would-be actor, but these days, reality TV is becoming a major launching pad for some of the industry's biggest stars. Before they were red-carpet regulars, NeNe Leakes, Jennifer Hudson, Julianne Hough and Lucy Hale were among those who broke through as reality stars\n\n\u201cI would love to have another little boy,\u201d she told Us. \u201cI am just obsessed with my boys.\u201d The Don\u2019t Be Tardy star added: \u201cI\u2019m about to be 40 so I would like to hurry up if we\u2019re going to do it, but I definitely think about it a lot.\u201d\n\nAnd during an October appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Zolciak revealed she missed breast-feeding and snuggling a newborn. \u201cI have baby fever so bad,\u201d she admitted. Kroy, 32, was on the same page. Quipped the dad: \u201cNever say never.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Zolciak cleared up the breast flashing incident in a statement to Us Weekly on Tuesday. \u201cThe private snap that everyone is freaking out about was supposed to be private,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut I accidentally sent it to everyone.\u201d\n\nZolciak also wants the world to know she didn\u2019t confirm Khlo\u00e9\u2019 Kardashian\u2019s pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThe conversation we were having was with my friend Chloe, AGAIN not Khloe Kardashian,\u201d Zolciak said. \u201cEveryone needs to stop putting words in my mouth and making it out to be something that was never confirmed nor talked about.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
