It also puts \u201cIdol\u201d back on schedule. With shooting on live auditions slated to begin Tuesday, ABC and producer FremantleMedia faced the possibility of having to delay the start of production if the judges table had not been set.\n\nABC also on Friday confirmed that Bryan is joining the show. Variety broke news of his involvement last weekend.\n\nA legendary R&B musician, Richie was said by sources to be a favorite choice of Perry, and had for months been in engaged in on-again, off-again talks. But the \u201cHello\u201d singer had backed away from discussions after fielding a lowball offer from ABC.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cLuke and Lionel are the perfect additions to round out our panel of judges for \u2018American Idol\u2019 on ABC,\u201d said Channing Dungey, president, ABC Entertainment. \u201cIn their respective genres of music, both Luke and Lionel possess insurmountable popularity and award-winning talent that are undeniable, and we are lucky that they will help in paving the way for hopefuls pursuing their dreams on our stage.\u201d\n\nThe network and producers had trouble filling out the show\u2019s talent roster after signing Perry in May to a deal that gives her $25 million for one season. Ryan Seacrest later struck a deal that gave him $15 million to host this season. The Perry and Seacrest agreements left fewer than $10 million in the initial talent budget ABC laid out for the show. But Richie and ABC were finally able to come to terms aster a search that saw names such as Charlie Puth, Keith Urban, Scooter Braun, Dolly Parton, Common, and Troy Carter rumored and considered.\n\nABC has yet to announce a premiere date for \u201cIdol,\u201d but is believed to be eyeing a debut in March, after the network\u2019s telecast of the Academy Awards.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited at the chance to help some deserving artists reach their dreams,\u201d said Bryan. \u201cTo be in a position in my career to help facilitate this along with the other judges is just a complete honor. It\u2019s gonna be a blast!\u201d\n\n\u201cI am very excited to be joining Katy, Luke and Ryan on \u2018American Idol,\u2019\u201d said Richie. \u201cAs a singer, songwriter and producer, I feel I can bring a great deal of experience to the table. It\u2019s going to be so much fun!\u201d\n\nTrish Kinane, president of Entertainment Programming, FremantleMedia North America, executive producer and showrunner of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d said, \u201cWe have taken our time to get the right mix of amazing talent for the new Idol judging panel. Our viewers expect musical credibility, passion and a true concern for the contestants; and with Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie joining the brilliant Katy Perry, we have two more world-class musical powerhouses eager to get to work and identify the next generation of superstars.\u201d\n\nPeter Hurwitz, CEO and president of 19 Entertainment-parent Core Media Group, also a producer on the show, said, \u201cThis extraordinary panel of judges speaks volumes about the continued power of the iconic \u2018American Idol\u2019 brand. We are thrilled to have Lionel Richie and Luke Bryan join Katy Perry and, ultimately, millions of viewers as we begin this new era on ABC.\u201d", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lionel.jpg?w=1000&h=667&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lionel.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lionel.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Holloway Shirley Halperin", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/lionel-richie-american-idol-1202575825/", "title": "Lionel Richie Joins \u2018American Idol\u2019 as Third Judge; Luke Bryan Officially Aboard", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Lionel Richie has finalized a deal to join \"American Idol\" as a judge.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Daniel Holloway,Shirley Halperin", "tags": "American Idol, Lionel Richie", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Lionel Richie Joins \u2018American Idol\u2019 as Third Judge; Luke Bryan Officially Aboard", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/lionel-richie-american-idol-1202575825/", "description": "Lionel Richie has finalized a deal to join \"American Idol\" as a judge.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lionel.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Lionel Richie Joins 'American Idol' as Third Judge"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-29T19:18:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-09-29T19:47:04+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lionel Richie has finalized a deal to join \"American Idol\" as a judge.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@gdanielholloway", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lionel Richie Joins \u2018American Idol\u2019 as Third Judge; Luke Bryan Officially Aboard", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/lionel.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506712681.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
