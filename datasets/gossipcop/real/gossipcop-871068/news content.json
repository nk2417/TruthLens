She starred on the first two seasons of the reality show Flavor of Love (2006), where she was given the nickname \"New York\" by rapper Flavor Flav.[2] Pollard later starred in spin-off series, including I Love New York (2007\u20132008) which launched a career in television.[3] Subsequent television roles include her hosting in Brunch with Tiffany (2017\u20132020) and Hot Haus (2022\u20132023), and her roles on House of Villains (2023\u20132026) and College Hill: Celebrity Edition (2023).[4][5][6]\n\nIn 2016 Pollard joined the British version of Celebrity Big Brother.[7] She has hosted the Fenty Beauty holiday gift guide twice\u2014once in 2018 and again in 2019\u2014at the request of Rihanna.[8][9][10] In January 2025, she was a contestant on a season of the cooking competition series Worst Cooks in America: Celebrity Edition.[11]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\n2005\u20132006: Beginnings and early breakthrough [ edit ]\n\nPollard began her television career in 2005 at the age of 23, when she was working as a clothing buyer and walking down Hollywood Boulevard. She was noticed by a casting agent from 51 Minds Entertainment, leading to her being cast in Flavor of Love, a reality television dating competition series which was filmed in late 2005 and debuted in early 2006.[12]\n\nWhile Pollard was on Flavor of Love, she had occasional clashes with other contestants. Although these clashes were, in general, nothing more than words, an incident in the penultimate episode of season one led to violence. After her elimination, an outraged Brooke \"Pumkin\" Thompson spat on Pollard following a heated exchange.[13] There was extensive tension between Pollard and Thompson throughout the show. Pollard vowed to \"whoop Pumkin's ass\", and attempted to do so at the season one reunion.[14] The final two contestants journeyed to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, where Flavor Flav chose Nicole \"Hoopz\" Alexander over Pollard, to be his mate.[15] However, after his relationship with Alexander did not work out, Flav decided to return for a second season of his dating show.[16]\n\nDuring the filming of Flavor of Love 2, Flav invited Pollard, then 24, to join him in helping eliminate contestants. She agreed and was later added as a participant.[17] Pollard made it to the finale once again; however, Flav ultimately chose \"Deelishis\" over Pollard.[18] The season finale was the second highest non-sports basic cable program of the year drawing over 7.5 million viewers.[19][20][21]\n\n2007\u20132010: Television spin-off series [ edit ]\n\nPollard in 2009\n\nPollard was given her own spin-off series I Love New York which was Pollard's first reality television series.[22] She went on to star in other spin-off series, including I Love New York 2, New York Goes to Hollywood, New York Goes to Work, and more recently, Brunch with Tiffany.[23]\n\nBefore the finale of Flavor of Love's second season, Pollard denied having her own show. However, after the finale aired, she said that she had already signed on for one. I Love New York, a reality series focused on Pollard as she navigated a group of suitors vying for her affection, premiered on January 8, 2007, and remains the most-watched series debut in VH1 history with 4.426 million viewers.[24] Pollard chose Patrick \"Tango\" Hunter in the finale, however the two had a falling out, and their engagement ended shortly after filming.[25]\n\n51 Minds Entertainment premiered a follow-up season of I Love New York 2 on October 8, 2007 on VH1.[26] The second season introduced a new group of men, including \"Tailor Made\" and \"Mr. Boston\". In the finale Tailor Made (real name George Weisgerber) proposed to Pollard, but was turned down. During the I Love New York 2 reunion special, Tailor Made proposed a second time and Pollard accepted.[27][28]\n\nPollard's efforts to land a high-profile acting role provided a narrative for another new spin-off. New York Goes to Hollywood premiered on August 4, 2008, on VH1.[29]\n\nIn 2009, Pollard stepped out of the lifestyle she had grown accustomed to and took on the challenge of trying a humble job. Her fourth spin-off series, New York Goes to Work, premiered on May 4, 2009, and follows Pollard each week as viewers voted via text message on which of three job options she would take. If she successfully impressed her employer, she would earn a $10,000 bonus. However, if she quit, failed, or was fired, she would forfeit the bonus. Over the course of the series, Pollard earned $45,000 in bonuses, succeeding in four jobs, failing or quitting four others, and ultimately drawing in the season finale. In the series finale, viewers voted via mobile poll to choose New York's next task, and the majority selected I Love New York 3.[30]\n\nProduction for I Love New York 3 was set to start sometime in the first quarter of 2010; however, prior to that time frame, VH1 requested immediate cancellation of the \"celebreality\" franchise and shelved plans for I Love New York 3. In the summer of 2011, Pollard revealed that I Love New York 3 was shelved due to the murder-suicide case of Ryan Jenkins, who was a former contestant of Megan Wants a Millionaire. Following the halt in production, Pollard decided to take a step back from the spotlight for a period of time, marking a significant shift in her public life.[31]\n\n2011\u20132014: Semi-hiatus and career progression [ edit ]\n\nAfter I Love New York 3 was shelved, Pollard appeared in various television series, such as DTLA and That Sex Show.[32] In 2014, Pollard was profiled in an episode of E!'s True Hollywood Story, which revisted her rise to fame and explored her journey as a television personality.[33]\n\n2015\u20132019: Continued exposure [ edit ]\n\nIn April 2015, Pollard had a guest appearance on the E!
