Copyright unknown)\n\nVictoria Beckham is off the crutches and back in heels!\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nThe Spice Girl turned fashion designer has been hobbling around on a pair of crutches lately following a skiing accident, but her style game has officially resumed.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nJust days after branding herself a \"terrible mother\" for sending her three youngest kids off to school in the snow, VB has jetted to New York for her eldest's birthday.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nBrooklyn turns 19 tomorrow and kick-started the celebrations by having breakfast with mum.\n\nView 14 Images Victoria has got rid of

wrapped up warm in a turtleneck and red knit top that she paired with a red plaid skirt and a pair of heeled boots.\n\nShe wore her hair in a bun and kept her eyes hidden beneath a pair of designer shades as she stepped out with Brooklyn, who was wearing black trousers and a bomber jacket, decorated with patches, that was a gift from his girlfriend, actress Chloe Moretz.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nBrooklyn moved to New York last year to study photography, but has remained very close to his family, particularly his mum who visits on a regular basis.\n\nThe teenager flashed photographers a smile as he walked round to the other side of a waiting car, while his mum climbed into the back.\n\nBrooklyn recently showed the world how much he loves his mum by getting a tattoo to honour her.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 14 Images She's on the mend (Image: Instagram/victoriabeckham)\n\nView 14 Images Brooklyn's new tattoo (Image: brooklynbeckham/Instagram)\n\nVictoria Beckham ,forces kids to school, in snow with worst snacks\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nTaking to Instagram, the 18-year-old who got his first tatt back in April and has since had more than eight designs inked on his body, shared a black and white snap of the word 'mum' written across a heart and three roses.\n\nFamous Los Angeles-based tattoo artist Dr Woo, who has worked on Brooklyn before, was the one responsible for the aspiring photographer's latest design.\n\nAnd just last month, Brooklyn celebrated girlfriend Chloe's 21st birthday, meaning she could have something special planned for him.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nBrooklyn has been discovering his style since he moved to New York.\n\nAnd he debuted a very different look as he rocked guyliner to one of Chloe's birthday celebrations.\n\n14

Angeles.\n\nAnd Brooklyn took to Instagram to share snaps from their date night.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nIn one, Brooklyn sits on a crushed velvet and leather sofa and Chloe sprawls out across him.\n\nHis short brown hair is spiked up with gel and he has a tiny moustache and goatee beard.\n\nHe also has a line shaved into his right eyebrow.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nThe photography student is wearing a white T-shirt and black jeans with black chunky boots, and finished his look off with a flick of eyeliner.\n\nView 14 Images Her style game is back on (Image: Splash News)\n\nView 14 Images Brooklyn

lies back on the sofa with her legs propped up on the arm.\n\nThe red-lipped actress shows off her toned pins in a black velvet mini dress and knee-high leather boots.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nIn another picture, they've changed outfits, but Brooklyn still looks to be wearing his guyliner.\n\nIn this snap, he's wearing a white shirt and braces, while blonde beauty Chloe wears an Oriental-style dress.\n\nShe's holding a plate in one hand and shoving cake into her boyfriend's mouth with the other.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 14 Images They're so loved up (Image: WENN.com)\n\nView 14 Images Brooklyn

posted the pictures on Instagram.\n\nFans were torn over his look.\n\nOne said: \"Couple of the year\"\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"perfect,\" said another.\n\nAnd another wrote: \"Serious couple goals\"\n\nBut another commented: \"Wee man, see the line you aren\u2019t meant to cross re make up, hair dye and shaved eyebrow.
