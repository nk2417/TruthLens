Just four days since reaching the legal age limit for models walking on the catwalk and a few after her first photo shoot for British Vogue was released, the daughter of Cindy Crawford made her runway debut in Raf Simons's sophomore Calvin Klein 205W39NYC collection. And what a debut it was. Taking the fourth-exit slot in a black-and-white stiff-collared shirt with canary-yellow trousers and a colour-pop turquoise polo-neck, Kaia transformed from the all-American girl we know and love her to be to a new-gen mid-West cowgirl. It was a look that Jessie from Toy Story would definitely not resist slipping into. Speaking of her big debut, Kaia took to Instagram to share enthusiasm for her first booking. \"There are no words to describe how I feel\", she wrote. \"I love you endlessly Raf!\" Growing up in a household where catwalking is a normal everyday profession - Kaia's brother Presley has already followed in their mother's footsteps and walked in shows including Balmain, Dolce & Gabbana and Moschino - her debut walk in front of every single big-name editor came with a nonchalant ease that has already seen her being booked for the Alexander Wang and Fenty x Puma and Coach shows. But Kaia's first fashion week didn't end in New York. The model travelled across the pond to join her brother on Christopher Bailey's September show catwalk. In pictorial form, go inside Kaia's first run of shows:", "images": ["https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/68ff0c1567c1a18449b90c7b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.co.uk/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/uk/logo.svg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d547bfa808924000824c7e3/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-845026380.jpg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d54801d120ed20008b8c478/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/original", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d547bfa33d89a0008f90720/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-843920334_b.jpg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/68fa5146a44b8b3c329a070a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d547bfa120ed20008b8c112/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-844659740.jpg", "https://www.vogue.co.uk/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/uk/logo-header.svg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/68ff11e8d631b7b586e82d87/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d547bfbe598280008780304/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-844623870.jpg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d547bfb2443fe00081585e6/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/rexfeatures_9047164bq.jpg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d547bfae5812d00085bcc17/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-844427774.jpg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d547bfae144470008e43a70/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/_KLE0055.jpg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d547bfae598280008780301/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/rexfeatures_9047016aa.jpg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/6908d303e7e1a147db5caccf/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.co.uk/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/logo-reverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d54801d120ed20008b8c478/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/original", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Naomi Pike"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/kaia-gerber-catwalk-cv-calvin-klein", "title": "Another Fashion Week, Another Debut For Kaia Gerber", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Naomi Pike", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Kaia Gerber - daughter of Cindy Crawford - made her catwalk debut at Raf Simons's Calvin Klein New York Fashion Week but now has walked for Burberry, Marc Jacobs, Prada, Saint Laurent and Chloe", "id": "5d547c07fe40ba0008d82ea0", "keywords": "miss vogue,miss vogue fashion,kaia gerber", "news_keywords": "miss vogue,miss vogue fashion,kaia gerber", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "gallery", "parsely-post-id": "5d547c07fe40ba0008d82ea0", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Kaia Gerber - daughter of Cindy Crawford - made her catwalk debut at Raf Simons's Calvin Klein New York Fashion Week but now has walked for Burberry, Marc Jacobs, Prada, Saint Laurent and Chloe\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d54801d120ed20008b8c478/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/original\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d54801d120ed20008b8c478/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/original\"}", "og": {"description": "You know she's only just getting started", "image": "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d54801d120ed20008b8c478/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/original", "site_name": "British Vogue", "title": "Another Fashion Week, Another Debut For Kaia Gerber", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/kaia-gerber-catwalk-cv-calvin-klein"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-10-09T09:10:04.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-23T21:00:00.000Z", "author": "Naomi Pike"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@BritishVogue", "description": "You know she's only just getting started", "domain": "https://www.vogue.co.uk", "image": "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d54801d120ed20008b8c478/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/original?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@BritishVogue", "title": "Another Fashion Week, Another Debut For Kaia Gerber"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d54801d120ed20008b8c478/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/original"}, "fb": {"app_id": 449870811704655, "pages": 104958196201736}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507540204.0, "source": "https://www.vogue.co.uk", "summary": ""}
