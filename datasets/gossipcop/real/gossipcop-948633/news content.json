Soon she is decamping for the venerable Ivy League school in Cambridge, Mass.\n\nHarvard\u2019s dorms open to freshmen Tuesday, and classes begin Aug. 30. The university is a familiar place for Obama\u2019s alumni parents, who both graduated from Harvard Law School. It also is no stranger to celebrity students and is the alma mater of eight U.S. presidents. That President Barack Obama\u2019s friends and former administration officials hold faculty posts at Harvard means his daughter won\u2019t be entirely on her own. A Secret Service detail will ensure that too.\n\n\u201cHow time flies,\u201d said Anita McBride, a chief of staff for former first lady Laura Bush, whose daughters Barbara and Jenna first welcomed Michelle Obama and her daughters into the White House after the 2008 election.\n\nThe White House florist had made bouquets for the Obama girls. The Bush daughters gave them the grand tour, teaching them how to slide down the banister in the solarium. The departing White House daughters also gave the Obama girls a friendly letter full of their well wishes and advice.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a girl who\u2019s grown up in the public eye and who\u2019s been able to maintain a normal, private life and make regular, everyday decisions about her education and life choices,\u201d McBride said.\n\n\u201cShe took advantage of a very interesting opportunity at a very unique time in her life, an in-between time in her life,\u201d she added. Delaying her Harvard start meant Malia Obama would arrive on campus with less visibility and pressure than had she started in 2016 during her father\u2019s final months in the Oval Office, added McBride, now with American University\u2019s School of Public Affairs.\n\nMalia Obama\u2019s gap year coinciding with her family leaving the White House in January gave her time and space to unwind with her parents and sister. \u201cThey had precious family time they were able to enjoy as the entire family was going through a transition,\u201d McBride said.\n\nThe Obamas moved into a home Washington\u2019s Kalorama neighborhood, letting Sasha Obama finish Sidwell Friends School, from which Malia Obama graduated in 2016. Sixteen-year-old Sasha will finish Sidwell in 2019.\n\nThe Obamas announced in May 2016 that Malia Obama had been accepted to Harvard but was taking a gap year. Her 12 months of me time, according to news accounts, featured an extended trip last fall to Bolivia and Peru, a journey reportedly organized by a Boulder, Colo., company called Where There Be Dragons. Eva Vanek, director of admissions for the firm, declined to talk about Malia Obama but spoke generally about its gap-year and summer programs, saying they operated in 19 countries in Asia, Africa and South and Central America.\n\nThe aim is a cross-cultural, experiential education, Vanek said. That means no five-star hotels or fancy buses, but rather home stays with local families, volunteer work, trips on public buses and often, language immersion. The small-group trips \u201caren\u2019t touristic. They aim to broaden students\u2019 perspectives about the world and themselves through these really intimate experiences,\u201d she said.\n\nThe goal is to let participants become \u201ccompetent travelers and more evolved humans,\u201d Vanek added.\n\nLast February, Malia Obama started an internship with the Weinstein Co., an employee there said. It\u2019s a film and television production and distribution company founded by brothers Bob and Harvey Weinstein. She hit the Sundance Film Festival in January, was spotted in Aspen, Colo., in February, traveled in June with her parents and sister to Bali and rocked out with her younger sister in August at Chicago\u2019s Lollapalooza.\n\nBecause of her gap year, Malia Obama will join Harvard\u2019s Class of 2021, an exclusive group about to get an expensive education.\n\nHarvard\u2019s tuition, fees, room and board run $65,509 for the upcoming school year, though many students get need-based financial aid. Only 5.4 percent of the 39,041 students who applied to be in the Class of 2020 were admitted: some 2,110 students. Altogether Harvard has about 6,700 undergraduates and 14,500 graduate and professional students.\n\nThe school boasts nearly 3,900 courses in 49 undergraduate fields of study, or \u201cconcentrations.\u201d All freshmen must take Expository Writing 20, but otherwise there is no preset curriculum. Those admitted into her 2021 class are, by a slim majority of 50.9 percent, mostly nonwhite, according to university officials, who declined to comment on the former first daughter.\n\nSoon she\u2019ll be able to stroll Harvard Yard, shop at the campus store called \u201cThe COOP\u201d and perhaps take meals with other freshmen at Annenberg Hall, a high-ceiling dining hall that draws comparisons to the Great Hall in the Harry Potter series. And she\u2019ll hit the books. University officials tell students to budget up to $1,200 a year for textbooks.\n\nThe college experience is one the Bush daughters anticipated. As the Obama family prepared to leave the White House, they sent the two teens another letter, previewing life as a former president\u2019s kids.\n\n\u201cEnjoy college. As most of the world knows, we did,\u201d they said in one passage. \u201cAnd you won\u2019t have the weight of the world on your young shoulders anymore.\u201d\n\nkskiba@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @KatherineSkiba", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2560px-Chicago_Tribune_Logo.svg-1.png", "data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/08/18/3WQ5HWNF2BBR7OR4QFQMIQV5EM.jpg?w=1024&h=670"], "top_img": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/08/18/3WQ5HWNF2BBR7OR4QFQMIQV5EM.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Skiba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2017/08/18/malia-obamas-gap-year-about-to-end-as-she-goes-to-harvard/", "title": "Malia Obama\u2019s gap year about to end as she goes to Harvard", "meta_data": {"application-name": "chicagotribune", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Katherine Skiba", "canonical": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2017/08/18/malia-obamas-gap-year-about-to-end-as-she-goes-to-harvard/"}, "description": "Malia Obama was 10 years old and in the fifth grade when her father became president, and next week she\u2019s set to start a new chapter.
