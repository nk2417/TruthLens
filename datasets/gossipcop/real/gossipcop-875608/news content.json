At last night\u2019s Glamour Women of the Year Awards, held at Brooklyn\u2019s historic Kings Theatre, the lauded magazine handed out its annual awards to the women who have made the biggest mark on 2017 in all areas, from politics to culture, sports to journalism. Honoree \u201cWonder Woman\u201d director Patty Jenkins was hailed for her work on the smash hit superheroine film, and original Wonder Woman Lynda Carter was on hand to introduce a gamechanger who she\u2019s very happy to also call her friend. Can\u2019t we all be Wonder Women together?\n\n\u201cShe got the essence of Wonder Woman because it lives inside her,\u201d Carter said. \u201cShe took the challenge of this miracle of an idea and a \u201970s iconic TV show and she made the \u2018she\u2019 become the \u2018we\u2019 on the big screen all over the world.\u201d\n\nIn a tribute video dedicated to Jenkins, the filmmaker opened up about her own path to Hollywood success, explaining that in her early years in the industry, she encountered \u201ca lack of interest, a lack of opportunity, I just had gotten used to it and kept trudging forward. All of the success that I have seen in Hollywood, behind the scenes, is pure perseverance.\u201d\n\n\u201cWonder Woman\u201d star Gal Gadot also weighed in, saying in that same video, \u201cPatty\u2019s legacy for women in Hollywood is basically paving the way to so many of us and so many female filmmakers.\u201d It\u2019s that legacy that Jenkins is fixed on these days.\n\nAs she accepted her Glamour Women of the Year Award, Jenkins further expounded on her years-long journey to make \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and why she thinks the film is more important \u2014 and necessary \u2014 than ever before. \u201cWhen I got the opportunity to make \u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 \u2014 as you can see, it was something I wanted to do for a long time \u2014 I think part of the reason is because what Wonder Woman stands for,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cI see a world where we need a new kind of hero.\u201d\n\nFor Jenkins and so many of Wonder Woman\u2019s fans, that didn\u2019t mean creating a new character, but turning to one that had long ago been created to inspire and empower women, and whose message has never grown less important over the intervening decades.\n\n\u201cThere was a 75-year-old hero that has been brought to life here and there who stands for something very new, which is that she stands for a new kind of hero who is strong and powerful and can fight the bad guy, but also believes in love and thoughtfulness and a better way and a different way,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s the hero that we need right now\u2026I feel like I got to make this movie about this incredible woman and, in so many ways, for women, because we need those women to go on and save the world for everyone.\u201d\n\nWhile both \u201cWonder Woman\u201d and Jenkins have seen boundary-busting, box office-smashing, record-cracking success in the months since the film first opened, the director is hopeful that such successes are only the beginning and signal big changes in other arenas, too, not just on the big screen or at the box office.\n\n\u201cI am so honored to have been a part of this movie and its success and everything is wonderful about that success and all it has done for women,\u201d Jenkins said. \u201cBut I also really want to continue that story by having women all over the world become the heroes that we need to save the day, as they already are, because I think we need women more than ever.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cAs we can see this year with all the change that\u2019s happening, we\u2019ve never needed women to not only be equal, but leading the way in so many ways.\u201d\n\nBoth Jenkins and Gadot are due to return for the film\u2019s much-anticipated sequel, which is now slated for a November 2019 release.
