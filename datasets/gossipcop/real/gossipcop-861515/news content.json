The second most-followed Twitter account belongs to Justin Bieber, who currently has 96.7 million followers. Next in line are Barack Obama (90.8 million), Taylor Swift (85.1 million) and Rihanna (74.1 million).\n\nOf course, how many millions of those followers are actually spam accounts or bots is unclear. CEO Jack Dorsey told Wall Street analysts in April that Twitter is continuing to battle bogus bots, which he said make up less than 5% of accounts.\n\nTwitter congratulated Perry on reaching the milestone with a retrospective video of her tweets over the years:\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Twitter/status/875730516783185920\n\nShe\u2019s also set new records on YouTube, with the video for single \u201cBon Appetit\u201d topping 16.8 million views in 24 hours after it was released last month (breaking her own record, previously set with \u201cRoar\u201d). Her \u201cWitness\u201d tour in the U.S. and Canada kicks off Sept. 9 and runs through February 2018.\n\nIn addition, Perry recently landed a gig as a judge on ABC\u2019s reboot of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d and this week helped announce the audition schedule for the show.\n\nPerry also will be part of YouTube original series \u201cBest.Cover.Ever,\u201d the singing competition show from Ryan Seacrest Productions and Endemol Shine North America. And she live-streamed a YouTube-exclusive special, \u201cKaty Perry \u2013 Witness World Wide,\u201d which ran for 96 hours from June 8-12 that drew more than 49 million total views. The broadcast followed Perry the entire time (including when she was sleeping), culminating in live performance of \u201cChained to the Rhythm\u201d with Pentatonix. Featured guests during the live-stream included James Corden, Sia, Dita Von Teese, and YouTube stars Liza Koshy and Gigi Gorgeous.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/katy-perry-bon-appetit-3.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/katy-perry-bon-appetit-3.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Spangler", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/katy-perry-twitter-100-million-followers-1202468906/", "title": "Katy Perry Becomes First Twitter User to Hit 100 Million Followers", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Singer Katy Perry, who just released her electronica-inflected album \"Witness,\" has become the first Twitter user to reach 100 million followers.
