I take umbrage. I refuse to be the ashes.\u201d\n\nThough a source confirmed to Us Weekly at the time that Affleck\u2019s ink was real, he claimed to Extra in 2016 that it was actually \u201cfor a movie.\u201d However, the tattoo made headlines again when the actor put it on full display on Thursday, March 15, while going shirtless on a beach in Hawaii.", "images":
