You can donate by texting Angel17 to 243725.\u201d\n\nHe also shared a short video of his charitable moment on his Instagram story. \u201cHAPPY THANKSGIVING!\u201d he wrote.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bb1_TWTHZnO/?taken-by=aaroncarter\n\nAaron Carter/Instagram\n\nOn Sept. 22, Carter entered rehab to \u201cimprove his health and work on his wellness,\u201d his publicist said at the time. The news came shortly after cops were summoned to Carter\u2019s Florida home to do a welfare check after a neighbor said he was slurring his words and his \u201cskin color was off.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cI Want Candy\u201d singer then left rehab for one week in October to attend to \u201clegal and personal matters,\u201d according to his publicist. He re-entered rehab on Oct. 6.\n\nEarlier this month, after completing treatment, Carter showed off his impressive 45 lb. weigh gain on social media.\n\n\u201cThis is my before and after pics,\u201d Carter, 29, wrote on Instagram, alongside a side-by-side photo. \u201cI went from 115 to 160 pounds in two months I feel amazing. 2018 I\u2019m ready for you!!\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BbVK0R8n2RW/?taken-by=aaroncarter\n\nThe musician is currently 15 lbs. up (45 lbs. total) from the last time he showed off his impressive progress back in October.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Aaron Carter Returns to Social Media to Show off Impressive Weight Gain After Rehab\n\nIn April, Carter attributed his headline-making weight loss to a hiatal hernia that he had been diagnosed with when he was 19.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible stress condition that affects me having an appetite and I\u2019m sorry this is the way I am,\u201d Carter said at the time on Twitter. (The tweets were later deleted.) \u201cBasically I have an eating disorder.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sometimes I really wish I did look better, or I eat more like y\u2019all say, this life doesn\u2019t come w much stability,\u201d he continued.", "images":
