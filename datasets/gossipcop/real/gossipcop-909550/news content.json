But Robbie, 33, did more than bring the famous doll to life. She also had a major hand in bringing last year\u2019s biggest blockbuster to life as one of the movie\u2019s producers. Now, she and her coproducers have the chance to bring home Oscar trophies for Best Picture at the 2024 Academy Awards.\n\nSince this year\u2019s Oscar nominations were announced in January, Robbie\u2019s absence from the Best Actress race has been cited as one of the biggest snubs, alongside Barbie director Greta Gerwig\u2019s in the directing category. For her part, Robbie isn\u2019t sweating it.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way to feel sad when you know you\u2019re this blessed,\u201d she said at a recent SAG-AFTRA screening of the movie. \u201cObviously I think Greta should be nominated as a director, because what she did is a once-in-a-career, once-in-a-lifetime thing, what she pulled off, it really is. But it\u2019s been an incredible year for all the films.\u201d\n\nA win on March 10 would mark Robbie\u2019s first Oscar, though she has been nominated twice before for her leading and supporting roles in I, Tonya and Bombshell, respectively.\n\nWho Is Margot Robbie?\n\nMargot Robbie is an Academy Award\u2013nominated actor known for her roles as Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad and controversial figure skater Tonya Harding in the biopic I, Tonya. Following in the footsteps of her Australian countrywomen Nicole Kidman and Cate Blanchett, Robbie first took the film world by storm in Martin Scorsese\u2019s 2013 movie The Wolf of Wall Street. More recently, she portrayed actor Sharon Tate in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood and earned a supporting Oscar nod for her role in Bombshell. In July 2023, Robbie headlined and produced the Greta Gerwig\u2013directed Barbie movie, which became the year\u2019s highest-grossing blockbuster and earned a Best Picture Oscar nomination.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Margot Elise Robbie\n\nBORN: July 2, 1990\n\nBIRTHPLACE: Dalby, Queensland, Australia\n\nSPOUSE: Tom Ackerley (2016-present)\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Cancer\n\nChildhood and Early Career on Neighbours\n\nMargot Elise Robbie was born in Dalby, Queensland, Australia on July 2, 1990, and grew up in Gold Coast, a city 500 miles north of Sydney. Her mother, Sarie Kessler, is a physiotherapist who raised her and her three siblings after her parents divorced. Her father is Doug Robbie.\n\nRobbie told Vanity Fair that she thought she might be a magician, but an interest in drama in high school led her to Melbourne and a kids\u2019 show, The Elephant Princess, co-starring the up-and-coming Liam Hemsworth. She has been professionally acting since her teens.\n\nBefore she left for Hollywood, Australian audiences knew her from the TV soap opera Neighbours, which began airing five years before her birth. Fearing she failed her audition, she decided to vacation in Canada but had to return quickly when she found out she had won the part of the vivacious Donna Freedman in 2008. Donna\u2019s kiss with a female friend stirred controversy, though she remained a viewer favorite and was nominated for several awards. She left Neighbours in 2010 (in a \u201cboring old happy ending\u201d), and her first American TV show, Pan Am (2011), crash-landed after one season.\n\nHollywood Breakthrough: Wolf of Wall Street and Focus\n\nGetty Images Leonardo DiCaprio and Margot Robbie attend a 2014 premiere of The Wolf of Wall Street. Robbie\u2019s role as the wife of DiCaprio\u2019s Jordan Belfort helped launch her mainstream career.\n\nFew remember Robbie\u2019s debut film, the Australian-made I.C.U., a serial killer thriller shot when she was 17 and released in 2009. Her part in Richard Curtis\u2019 time-travel rom-com About Time (2013), with Domhnall Gleeson and Rachel McAdams, made more of a splash. But it was her role as Naomi, Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Brooklyn bombshell wife and \u201cthe Duchess of Bay Ridge,\u201d in Martin Scorsese\u2019s based-on-a-true-story epic of financial flim-flammery The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) that turned heads.\n\nRobbie also got attention for her small but standout role playing herself in The Big Short in 2015. The comedic scene involved her explaining mortgage-backed securities and subprime loans, all the while floating in a tub of bubbles with champagne in hand.\n\nThat year also saw her first lead roles. Robbie co-starred opposite Will Smith in Focus, playing con artists who steal each other\u2019s hearts. She also starred in the sci-fi drama Z for Zachariah.\n\nHarley Quinn in Suicide Squad\n\nOne of Robbie\u2019s most notable roles is as the punkily attired fan fave Harley Quinn. She first appeared in the role in the comics-based smash Suicide Squad (2016). Harley Quinn is the psycho psychiatrist who is a muse to Jared Leto\u2019s Joker. Robbie told The Washington Post that diving into a vat of \u201cgluggy paint stuff\u201d to bleach Harley\u2019s skin in one scene was \u201cthe most unpleasant thing I\u2019ve ever done in my entire life,\u201d and her spiky accoutrement wasn\u2019t exactly comfortable either.\n\nRobbie planned to reprise her popular characterization of Harley Quinn in Gotham City Sirens, though that project was shelved in favor of another spin-off Birds of Prey, which co-starred Ewan McGregor and hit theaters in February 2020. Robbie again portrayed Harley Quinn in 2021\u2019s The Suicide Squad.\n\nMore Movies: The Legend of Tarzan, Once Upon a Time, and Bombshell\n\nAlso in 2016, Robbie starred as Jane in The Legend of Tarzan, with Alexander Skarsgard, and the following year she played the wife of Winnie the Pooh author A.A. Milne in the historical drama Goodbye Christopher Robin.\n\nRobbie then landed in another high-profile project by portraying actor Sharon Tate, a real-life victim of the notorious Charles Manson\u2013orchestrated murders of 1969, alongside Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s 2019 feature Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood.\n\nLate in 2019, Robbie enjoyed an even more prominent role in Bombshell, a retelling of the sexual harassment allegations that rocked Fox News under the oversight of former CEO Roger Ailes. Although her character of Kayla Pospisil was a fictional composite\u2014unlike the portrayals of Megyn Kelly by Charlize Theron and Gretchen Carlson by Nicole Kidman\u2014Robbie brought her \u201cChristian millennial\u201d character to life with a nuanced performance, impressing enough to earn Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations Best Supporting Actress.\n\nPlaying Tonya Harding in I, Tonya\n\nGetty Images Tonya Harding and Margot Robbie attend the 2018 Golden Globe Awards.\n\nA 3-year-old toddler when the 1994 Winter Olympics were held, Robbie had no idea who figure skater Tonya Harding was or what the infamous \u201cwhacking incident\u201d involving competitor Nancy Kerrigan was all about. But Robbie dove headlong into her starring role as Harding for 2017\u2019s darkly comedic biopic I, Tonya, recreating her every gesture as closely as possible. She did meet Harding, though limited their time together to a couple of hours prior to the completion of filming\u2014\u201cotherwise I might have too much empathy for her,\u201d she said after its premiere screening at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\n\n\nFor the movie, Harding\u2019s famous triple axel was recreated digitally, but Robbie performed some of the skating routines on her own accord and impressed enough with her overall performance to earn Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations for Best Actress.\n\nThe movie was also the first release for Robbie\u2019s Los Angeles\u2013based production company, LuckyChap Entertainment, which she founded with her husband and two friends years earlier. Since its 2014 beginnings, the company\u2019s goal has been to place a focal point on female-led stories in movies and television, which LuckyChap has accomplished with films like I, Tonya, Birds of Prey, Promising Young Woman (2020), and shows like Hulu\u2019s Dollface.\n\nRecent Movies: Amsterdam, Babylon, and Asteroid City\n\nIn recent years, Robbie\u2019s star power has continued to shine. After reprising her role as Harley Quinn in Birds of Prey (2020) and The Suicide Squad (2021), the actor moved on to 2022\u2019s Amsterdam. In the period piece set during World War I, Robbie plays Valerie Voze, a nurse who helps two injured soldiers played by Christian Bale and John David Washington. The film loosely follows a conspiracy plot to remove President Franklin D. Roosevelt from office and replace him with a dictator.\n\nThat same year saw the release of Babylon, in which Robbie\u2019s Nellie LaRoy and other characters try to live out their dreams of achieving Hollywood fame and stardom in the 1920s. In the rapidly evolving film industry, Nellie struggles to adapt and succumbs to vices that include drug use and gambling, which jeopardize her it girl status and career. The role earned Robbie her third Golden Globe nomination and second for Best Actress.\n\nRobbie was also among the star-studded cast in Wes Anderson\u2019s 2023 Asteroid City, which offers a meta-story-within-a-story plot that takes place in a 1950s desert town. Other cast members included Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, Tilda Swinton, Edward Norton, Adrien Brody, and Maya Hawke.\n\nBarbie\n\nGetty Images Margot Robbie attends the Barbie premiere in a black evening gown inspired by the 1960s \u201cSolo in the Spotlight\u201d Barbie doll.\n\nIn 2019, Warner Bros. and Mattel announced Robbie would take on the role of Barbie in Greta Gerwig\u2019s highly anticipated Barbie live-action movie. Robbie\u2019s LuckyChap Entertainment coproduced the project.\n\nDuring the press tour leading up to the film\u2019s July 2023 release, Robbie wore some of Barbie\u2019s most iconic looks throughout the years, including 1990s \u201cEnchanted Evening\u201d doll, 1960s \u201cSolo in the Spotlight\u201d doll, the 1992 \u201cTotally Hair\u201d doll, and a dress inspired by the 1959 Black and White swimsuit Barbie.\n\nThe internet collectively obsessed over the opening shot in a Barbie trailer that showed a pair of feet\u2014soon revealed to be Robbie\u2019s\u2014sliding out of heeled sandals and not losing the tip-toe arched stance of an actual Barbie doll\u2019s feet. Robbie, who is 5-foot-6, has previously mentioned that having \u201cbig feet\u201d can be embarrassing when she can\u2019t find heels in her size but recently said she\u2019s \u201creally flattered that people are excited about my feet.\u201d\n\nIn the movie, Robbie\u2019s Barbie has an existential crisis that takes her away from Barbie Land and brings her to the real world. Ryan Gosling costarred as Ken, while other Hollywood heavyweights, like Simu Liu, play different iterations of the Ken doll. Issa Rae, Will Ferrell, Kate McKinnon, America Ferrera, Emma Mackey, Dua Lipa, and Michael Cera also appear in the film. It debuted the same day as the equally anticipated biopic Oppenheimer, leading moviegoers to dub the joint release \u201cBarbenheimer.\u201d\n\nBarbie became the highest-grossing film of 2023 and set numerous records, including the highest-earning movie directed by a woman. That success translated into a slew of award nominations and the 2024 Golden Globe for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement, which Robbie and Gerwig accepted on behalf of the team. Individually, Robbie received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy and an Oscar nod for Best Picture as one of the film\u2019s producers. Her absence from the Best Actress race at the 96th Academy Awards was considered one of the year\u2019s biggest snubs.\n\nHusband\n\nGetty Images Margot Robbie and husband Tom Ackerley in June 2023\n\nRobbie met assistant director Tom Ackerley on the World War II drama Suite Francaise (2014). The two began dating and eventually got married in December 2016. They don\u2019t have any children.\n\nNet Worth\n\nRobbie\u2019s net worth shot up significantly in 2023 thanks to the actor\u2019s starring role in Barbie. According to Variety, Robbie\u2019s salary for the role was $12.5 million, boosting her total net worth to an estimated $40 million.\n\n\n\nFact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
