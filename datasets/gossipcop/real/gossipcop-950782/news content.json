Then, Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin allegedly follow suit. Now, two of your favorite Disney Channel stars leave Instagram shook with a single pic.\n\nKimberly J. Brown, who played heroine Marnie Piper in the first three Halloweentown movies (we do NOT talk about the fourth film), finally confirmed fans' suspicions that she and her Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge co-star, Daniel Kountz, were more than just friends.\n\nFor International Kissing Day on Saturday (July 6), Kimberly posted a kiss pic that would make Kalabar's jaw drop. \"#internationalkissingday you say? I\u2019ll just leave this right here then \ud83d\ude0f,\" she captioned.\n\nOMG. I ship it so hard. Seriously, they're both so dang cute!\n\nDaniel has been popping up on Kimberly's Instagram more frequently over the past few months. For Halloween last year, they did a couples costume as superheroes. A few months later, they spent Christmas Eve together.\n\nThey've hung out in Portland, saw Hamilton, and more recently, attended The Big Bang Theory star Kaley Cuoco's wedding.\n\nBack in 2016, fans first started noticing the DCOM stars had reconnected when Daniel appeared in Kimberly's hilarious short about what really happened to Kal at the end of Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge. (Spoiler: He went to magic rehab.)\n\nA year later, the duo acted onscreen together again in another short that's partly Not Safe for Disney.\n\nYou don't need to be Sherlock Holmes to crack this love mystery, but neither Kimberly nor Daniel confirmed they were more than friends \u2014 until that glorious pic dropped.\n\nStacey Grant is the Snapchat Editor at Seventeen.com.
