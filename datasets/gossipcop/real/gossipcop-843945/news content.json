Her name was Sister Cathy Cesnik. She was a beloved 26-year-old teacher at the local Archbishop Keough High School, and her death left the community confounded: Who would want to hurt this woman? Decades later, the case is still unsolved\u2014but the circumstances around it have grown wild and complex, with police desperate to determine if Cesnik\u2019s death had anything to do with a major sexual abuse scandal at the school. What did she know? And who, ultimately, used that information against her?\n\nThe mysterious murder is coming to light this spring thanks to Netflix, which is releasing a seven-part docu-series about Cesnik\u2019s death titled The Keepers. A new trailer, released on People, is giving true-crime fans a first look at the series, and is already striking an ominous, conspiratorial tone.\n\nThe trailer\u2019s main action is led by locals who knew Sister Cathy, particularly two former students who have never stopped trying to solve the devastating murder. After Cesnik\u2019s death, many quickly linked her case to the alleged covered-up sexual-abuse scandal by priest Father Joseph Maskell, who was accused of sexually abusing dozens of school girls. He later paid settlements to his accusers, per People.\n\nBut two of the accusers, Jean Wehner and Teresa Lancaster, decided to participate in the Netflix documentary, directed by Ryan White. The series digs into the allegations, attempting to untangle the dark web Maskell\u2014whom White describes as a \u201csociopath\u201d\u2014allegedly weaved, and trying to bring to light all the insidious participants who helped him get away it.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58f4de011602613884c2301b/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/t-the-keepers-netflix.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6914ab554a83822bb12772b6/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691755d7cf2db08d53ca35a0/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58f7a12fd30c374e9109f64a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cath.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690944318b75c927a793b8d6/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58f7866db5598f0e6b9257f9/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/netflix-ratings-orange-is-the-new-black.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fba4f6bff235ae96001118/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69134e1408e5ee77e37d2651/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e42b058b9f4acdad0c3b4/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ac9875f114d3ca724a0db8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/the-crown-julian-broad-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ac9875f114d3ca724a0db7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/the-crown-julian-broad-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68f7f5b76b78476ce0754a1b/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62fe7af0987db7065a9e93f4/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fb8e54c721f87930d61aba/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58cbeea365c51404f08418aa/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/netflix-algorithm-obsessed.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e0661d7f7e7718194d67e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ac98767a51b09e1bf347f7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/the-crown-julian-broad-ss03.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58f7a12fd30c374e9109f64a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cath.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Yohana Desta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/netflix-the-keepers-trailer", "title": "Your Next Netflix True Crime Obsession Might Actually Have a Satisfyin", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Yohana Desta", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "What ever happened to Sister Cathy?
