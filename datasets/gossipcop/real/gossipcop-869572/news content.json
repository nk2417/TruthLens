This includes a bit called Convers(at)ion Therapy, which features a non-binary guest and sees Harrison jokingly trying to \u201cconvert\u201d the person she\u2019s talking to at the end of the segment. Whether Harrison is discussing transgender dating life or ways to act more straight, one thing remains the same: She\u2019s always sneakily calling out those who aren\u2019t so welcoming to transgender people.\n\nIn addition to the trans talk, Harrison has also voiced her frustration with Donald Trump\u2018s presidency through her comedy, including \u201can inauguration day workout to prepare you for the Trump administration\u201d and \u201cChristmas songs for Trump\u2019s America.\u201d\n\nTake a look at Harrison\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s transgender military ban and some of her other transphobic/Trump-bashing videos below.\n\n\u201cTrump Bans Transgender People from Military, Comedian Patti Harrison Responds\u201d\n\n\u201cAn Apology on behalf of ALL Trans People\u201d\n\n\u201cAn Inauguration Day Workout to Prepare you for Trump\u2019s Administration\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can a Trans-Person Land a Cis Lover?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean to be a Trans-Trender?\u201d\n\n\u201cALL NEW CHRISTMAS SONGS FOR TRUMP\u2019S AMERICA\u201d\n\n\u201cCan Playing Foosball make You Cis?\u201d", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/patti-harrison-tonight-show-july-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/patti-harrison-tonight-show-july-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=628&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/patti-harrison-tonight-show-july-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Taylor Weatherby", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/patti-harrison-comedian-trump-transgender-ban-transphobic-people-videos-7881850/", "title": "6 Times Comedian Patti Harrison Has Poked Fun at Trump & Transphobic People", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Take a look at Harrison's response to Trump's transgender military ban and some of her other transphobic/Trump-bashing videos here.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Taylor Weatherby", "tags": "donald trump, Patti Harrison", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "6 Times Comedian Patti Harrison Has Poked Fun at Trump & Transphobic People", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/patti-harrison-comedian-trump-transgender-ban-transphobic-people-videos-7881850/", "description": "Take a look at Harrison's response to Trump's transgender military ban and some of her other transphobic/Trump-bashing videos here.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/patti-harrison-tonight-show-july-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Patti Harrison on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on July 26, 2017."}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-27T19:39:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-27T19:39:59+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Take a look at Harrison's response to Trump's transgender military ban and some of her other transphobic/Trump-bashing videos here.", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "6 Times Comedian Patti Harrison Has Poked Fun at Trump & Transphobic People", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/patti-harrison-tonight-show-july-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501184399.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
