there being too many in the past, but regardless of whether it was or not, Saoirse Ronan, nor her mother, Monica, will forget the 2018 Golden Globe Awards in a hurry.\n\nSaoirse had been touted as a potential winner in the build-up to the ceremony and so it proved on Sunday night as she came away with the award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy for her role as a high-school student in the coming-of-age movie Ladybird.\n\nYou can see the list of winners in full here.\n\nAs big a deal as the award is in itself, when you consider the competition she faced on the night \u2013 Emma Stone, Margot Robbie, Judi Dench and Helen Mirren \u2013 it really brings home the scale of the achievement.\n\nDue to time constraints, Saoirse was limited in what she could say in her acceptance speech but she did give a shout out to her mother watching \u201con Facetime over there on someone\u2019s phone right now\u201d as well as some of the important women in her life, all her family and friends and everyone in the room at The Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills.\n\nCheck out the acceptance speech below.\n\nA round of applause for Saoirse Ronan taking home the award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy for her role in @LadyBirdMovie! #GoldenGlobes pic.twitter.com/fXm4pygZ41 \u2014 Golden Globe Awards
