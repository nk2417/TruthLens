These findings seem to corroborate items that had been found at the scene by investigators, including a pint glass of Corona beer, an empty bottle of Stella Artois, and also a prescription bottle of Zolpidem, a generic of Ambien.\n\nBased on a blood test, Bennington\u2019s body tested \u201cpresumptive positive\u201d for MDMA \u2014 also known as ecstasy \u2014 but two additional urine tests failed to detect the drug. The autopsy concluded the rocker was not under the influence of the drug when he died.\n\nGregg DeGuire/WireImage\n\nBennington is described as having \u201ca history of alcoholism, depression, suicidal ideations and prior suicide attempts,\u201d The Blast reports.\n\nHis wifeTalinda told authorities just after his death that Bennington had been in an outpatient treatment program.\n\nLaw enforcement officials responded to an emergency call from Bennington\u2019s home in Palos Verdes Estates, California, around 9 a.m., on July 20, an officer told PEOPLE. Bennington, 41, hanged himself and was discovered by his housekeeper.\n\nBennington\u2019s bandmate, guitarist and vocalist Mike Shinoda, confirmed the news on Twitter, writing: \u201cShocked and heartbroken, but it\u2019s true. An official statement will come out as soon as we have one.\u201d\n\nThe rock frontman was a close friend of Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell \u2014 who also committed suicide by hanging in May \u2014 and spoke at his funeral. Bennington\u2019s body was found on what would have been Cornell\u2019s 53rd birthday.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Chester Bennington\u2019s Widow Shares Video of Him Happy Before Suicide\n\nBennington left behind his wife Talinda and his six children. The musician had three children with his wife \u2014 son Tyler, and twin daughters Lilly and Lila\u2013 and children Jamie, Isaiah and Draven from previous relationships.\n\nJust a week before his death, Bennington and his bandmates filmed an episode of Carpool Karaoke with James Corden. In footage of the clip that had since been released, the frontman looks happy as he sings along with the group.\n\nSurviving members of Linkin Park paid tribute to their fallen bandmate on Oct. 27 with a tribute concert at the Hollywood Bowl.\n\nThe news was first reported by TMZ.", "images":
