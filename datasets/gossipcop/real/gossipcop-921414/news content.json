They've worked on various projects together over the years, and Dylan has always been supportive of his brother's many Hollywood triumphs.\n\nIn December 2023, the High School Musical received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with Dyland and their parents by his side.\n\n\u201cI know there [have] been a lot of sacrifices that you guys have made for me in my life and it couldn't have been easy. Thanks for believing in me ... you\u2019re the reason I'm here today,\u201d Zac told his family on stage.\n\nMore recently, Dylan appeared on The Traitors season 3 \u2014 and left a winner alongside his fellow Faithfuls Dolores Catania, Ivar Mountbatten and Gabby Windey.\n\nHere\u2019s everything to know about Zac\u2019s brother.\n\nHe\u2019s four years younger than Zac Efron\n\nGilbert Flores/Variety/Getty\n\nBorn on Feb. 6, 1992, Dylan is four years younger than Zac. The brothers grew up in Arroyo Grande, California, where their parents, Starla Baskett and David Efron, worked at the same power plant.\n\nFollowing their parents' divorce, David eventually went on to remarry and had two more children, Olivia and Henry, of whom Zac and Dylan occasionally share photos on social media.\n\nHe went to school at California Polytechnic State University\n\nDylan went to school at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics in 2013.\n\nHe\u2019s a producer\n\nJust like Zac, Dylan has dipped his toes into the entertainment industry. While Zac predominantly appears on screen, his brother has worked behind the scenes as a production coordinator on several projects, including American Sniper, Live by Night and Ready Player One, per his IMDb page.\n\nAdditionally, he served as a producer on Zac\u2019s docuseries Down to Earth with Zac Efron, which ran for two seasons beginning in 2020. He even appeared on a few episodes of the series alongside Zac.\n\nHe\u2019s very close with Zac Efron\n\nZac Efron/Instagram\n\nWhether it be sitting courtside at Lakers games or golfing together, Zac and Dylan's close bond is frequently on display \u2014 although it wasn\u2019t always smooth sailing for the brothers.\n\nIn a 2021 interview with BroBible, Dylan said that he and Zac \u201cwere always fighting with each other\u201d when they were kids; at the time, he recalled, they were \u201cso different.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]hen once I graduated college, Zac really took me under his wing and let me live with him when I got my first job in Los Angeles,\u201d Dylan said. \u201cHe really became that older brother, and that\u2019s when I would say we grew closer than ever. Our relationship was something that developed more as we both became adults and stopped fighting so much.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s super athletic\n\nDylan is incredibly active, constantly sharing his adventures in surfing, skateboarding, kayaking, and more on his Instagram profile. Additionally, he\u2019s a big runner, competing in various triathlons over the years, including the Malibu Triathlon in 2021 alongside actors Mark Feuerstein and Chace Crawford.\n\nDuring an interview with Just Jared in 2020, he noted that he\u2019s been racing triathlons since 2015. \u201cAt IRONMAN Arizona, I finished under 10 hours 30 mins. That same year, I finished in the top 1% of athletes in my age group,\u201d he told the publication.\n\nHe loves the outdoors\n\nDylan Efron/Instagram\n\nAlso evidenced by his Instagram profile bio, which reads \u201cHappiest Outside,\u201d Dylan is a big lover of the outdoors. He regularly shares photos of his adventures, including hiking in Guyana and rock climbing in Croatia.\n\nIn fact, one of his many tattoos was inspired by one of his travels. In September 2020, he shared a photo of his thigh tattoo documenting Nepal's mountains. \u201cI finished the Boston Marathon and flew to Nepal the next morning with @Zacefron,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThis trip changed my life. We made goals, challenged our perspectives and sought change. I don\u2019t think tattoos need to be symbolic to be art, but this one reminds me to take chances and pursue my passions with everything i\u2019ve got.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a dog parent\n\nDylan Efron/Instagram\n\nIn 2021, Dylan adopted a sweet dog named Booey who he regularly posts about on social media. The dog even has his own Instagram account, @goodboybooey, where Dylan shares updates on their escapades.\n\nHe competed on The Traitors season 3\n\nDylan Efron on 'The Traitors' season 3. Euan Cherry/Peacock via Getty\n\nIn June 2024, Peacock announced the official cast list for the third season of The Traitors. Along with Dylan, other notable cast members included The Bachelorette star Wells Adams, Selling Sunset\u2019s Chrishell Stause and Britney Spears' ex-husband Sam Asghari.\n\nThe Traitors season 3 premiered in January 2025, but months earlier, Zac was already rooting for his brother to win, telling Entertainment Tonight in June 2024 that he had \"high hopes\" for Dylan.\n\n\"He is just the best at games. Growing up, he was a first roll [at Yahtzee] kind of dude,\" he said. \"If I was him, I would move to Vegas and just play games. He's that good, so I got high hopes for him.\"\n\nThe season three finale of The Traitors, which aired on March 6, saw Dylan and his fellow Faithfuls \u2014 Dolores, Ivar and Gabby \u2014 vote to end the game and split $204,300.", "images":
