{"url": "https://ew.com/movies/2018/07/17/jude-law-dumbledore-interview/", "text": "Re-castings of iconic beloved roles made famous by other actors are normally met with some degree of fandom skepticism. Yet when Warner Bros. announced Jude Law was stepping into the role of \u201cyoung\u201d Albus Dumbledore for Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, it felt like a perfectly shaped puzzle piece that clicked into place. Subsequent photos of Law as Dumbledore and a trailer showing the Sherlock Holmes and The Young Pope star giving some warm-yet-snappy line delivery as the charismatic future Hogwarts headmaster have subsequently reinforced the feeling that the 45-year-old actor was an unexpected yet ideal choice.\n\nBelow, Law takes our questions about how his Dumbledore differs from the Harry Potter-era character, details some of what author J.K. Rowling told him during their meeting, reveals (somewhat inadvertently) a couple intriguing plot details, and weighs in on the debate about how his character\u2019s sexuality should be depicted.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: So before you took on this role, what research did you do, if any?\n\nJUDE LAW: I knew the books and the Harry Potter films pretty well, my children grew up with them so I grew up as an accompanying adult. And I\u2019d seen and enjoyed the first [Fantastic Beasts] film. Then I had the good fortune and opportunity to sit with [author and screenwriter] J.K. Rowling shortly after we started work on it. She gave me a very good sense of Albus\u2019 life journey and who he was and what was happening in his head and his heart and his world for this particular story.\n\nDid you look at the performances of previous Dumbledore actors Richard Harris and Michael Gambon?\n\nI\u2019m sure they were in the back of my mind, because I\u2019d seen their work and admired both of them as actors, greatly. I talked with [director] David Yates about that and we both decided that it wasn\u2019t necessary to do an impersonation of one of them as a younger man. This is a man with almost 100 years ahead of him before he became that character so we wanted to look at who he was in this moment and construct our own version. It makes me laugh when he\u2019s called \u201cYoung Albus\u201d because I\u2019m 45, so I\u2019m more in the middle of a midlife crisis, but I\u2019m happy to hold onto that as long as I can!\n\nI found it funny you went from playing the Young Pope to Young Albus in pop culture.\n\nThe word \u201cYoung\u201d has to be in every part I play, it\u2019s contractual.\n\nWhat did Rowling say in terms of the performance or interior life of the character that you found helpful?\n\nWell gosh, there was so much reference to interior life. The one thing that came out was the sense of play. He has a youthful mercurial approach to life, but that there\u2019s something that hangs heavy in his heart, in his past, that underlies all of that. There\u2019s a root of good humor and good heart and sense of self and a sense of past.\n\nHow much say, if any, did you have on how he looks in the film?\n\nWhen you hire [famed costume designer] Colleen Atwood, you know you\u2019re in the hands of someone rather great. There\u2019s no one quite like her in the world of film. She has a very clear vision. It was open and collaborative, there were tweaks here and there, but I was happily corralled into the overall look which was clear from the get-go.\n\nSo what\u2019s Dumbledore like at this age and how different is he than how we know him?\n\nAs I mentioned before, there\u2019s a sense of humor and mischief, a dash of anarchy, a sense of what\u2019s right and what he believes in, and a sense of mystery. There\u2019s also how he comes around to get people onto his way of thinking \u2014 which is rather indirectly. He also has a certain heaviness about him that I don\u2019t want to reveal too much about \u2014 and that\u2019s something he has to overcome, or hopes to overcome. He\u2019s also got a great passion for sharing his knowledge, he\u2019s a powerful and inclusive teacher.\n\nSo he teaches Transfiguration, right?\n\nHe doesn\u2019t teach Transfiguration, actually, not at this stage.\n\nOh! Because in Potter lore, it was said he used to be a Transfiguration teacher before becoming headmaster\u2026\n\nAt this stage in his career, he\u2019s not. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m allowed to say what he teaches\u2026[Editor\u2019s note: We think we may have figured it out]\n\nAh, okay. Well, what was your favorite spell to cast?\n\nWell \u2026 I ah \u2026 I only get to cast one. There\u2019s a lot you don\u2019t know about Albus in this film. And there are certain restrictions in storytelling \u2014 you\u2019ll see, it all makes sense. You don\u2019t see him in full flow yet.\n\nInteresting! And if I remember right, Dumbledore doesn\u2019t yet have the infamous Elder Wand, right? So what\u2019s his current wand like?\n\nAlbus doesn\u2019t have the Elder Wand yet, no. I have a wand. It\u2019s very reflective of him, beautiful dark wood root with a stone on one end.\n\nHe calls on Newt to go after Grindelwald. What\u2019s his relationship with his former student?\n\nI think he admires in Newt this sense of moral code that he will always do the right thing because he can\u2019t do anything but the right thing. I think he likes that Newt finds beauty in beasts because I think occasionally Dumbledore feels like a beast. And there\u2019s a master and mentee kind of relationship. And Newt isn\u2019t afraid to say when he thinks Dumbledore is wrong, it\u2019s not servitude.\n\nThere was some uproar earlier this year when director David Yates told EW the character not \u201cexplicitly gay\u201d in this film. What\u2019s your take on how apparent Dumbledore\u2019s sexuality should be?\n\nJo Rowling revealed some years back that Dumbledore was gay. That was a question I actually asked Jo and she said, yes, he\u2019s gay. But as with humans, your sexuality doesn\u2019t necessarily define you; he\u2019s multifaceted. I suppose the question is: How is Dumbledore\u2019s sexuality depicted in this film? What you got to remember this is only the second Fantastic Beasts film in a series and what\u2019s brilliant about Jo\u2019s writing is how she reveals her characters, peels them to the heart over time. You\u2019re just getting to know Albus in this film, and there\u2019s obviously a lot more to come. We learn a little about his past in the beginning of this film, and characters and their relationships will unfold naturally which I\u2019m excited to reveal. But we\u2019re not going to reveal everything all at once.\n\nObviously, Dumbledore had a relationship with Grindelwald. What\u2019s that relationship like at this point in time? And what was it like working with Johnny Depp?\n\nI don\u2019t actually have any scenes with Johnny. As I said before, this is only Part 2 of a longer story. I\u2019ve always admired him from afar, but we don\u2019t know each other, and I\u2019ve not yet met him on this. In many ways that suits the relationship as it\u2019s been many years since they\u2019ve seen each other. So there\u2019s complexity in that that\u2019s fun to mine. Again, the past will reveal itself.\n\nFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald opens Nov. 16.", "images":
