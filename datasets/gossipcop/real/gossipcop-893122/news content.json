Reimagined by the company\u2019s recently appointed chief creative officer, Reed Krakoff, late of Coach, it now features, in addition to several rooms of glass cases displaying wares, a caf\u00e9\u2014every surface of which is done in the brand\u2019s signature shade of turquoise. The headlines have all been almost exactly the same: \u201cFinally, You Can Have Breakfast at Tiffany.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s What Having Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s Really Looks Like.\u201d \u201cYou Can Literally Have Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s.\u201d \u201cI Tried to Have Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s.\u201d They refer, of course, to the opening scene of \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s,\u201d the iconic 1961 film adaptation of Truman Capote\u2019s 1958 novella, in which Audrey Hepburn arrives at this very store, the block empty of all other people, at what\u2019s meant to be the crack of dawn after a long night of revelry. Wearing a black ball gown with matching gloves, an elaborate updo, oversized sunglasses, and several lush strands of pearls, she gets out of a cab, carrying a small white paper bag, and walks up to one of the windows displaying jewelry. Barely taking her eyes off the diamonds, she opens the bag and removes a cup of coffee and a pastry, which she bites into, her skeletal jaw working hard as the strings swell on \u201cMoon River,\u201d the movie\u2019s theme song, which was written for Hepburn.\n\nThough her character, Holly Golightly\u2014opaquely drawn as a high-end call girl\u2014is something of a down-on-her-luck striver, an outsider looking in and up, the scene is not about longing or aspiration so much as it is about ritual and the search for simple, almost pastoral pleasures in a dense and hectic city. The street is hers alone; the coffee and pastry are hers alone; the window displays, even, are hers alone. Explaining the store\u2019s draw, later in the film (and, almost word for word, in Capote\u2019s novella), she says that, when she\u2019s feeling awful, \u201cThe only thing that does any good is to jump in a cab and go to Tiffany\u2019s. Calms me down right away. The quietness and the proud look of it. Nothing very bad could happen to you there.\u201d\n\nTimes have changed, to say the least. Tiffany & Co. now shares a block and a wall with Trump Tower, a place where very bad things seem likely to have happened, a place where you may have recently stood in the middle of a surging mass of people chanting \u201cShame! Shame! Shame!\u201d during a political protest. Approaching the store requires maneuvering, at any hour, around large, ugly plastic barriers, and, for a certain kind of person, thinking about the state of the nation. Nonetheless, on Tuesday morning, I, too, tried to have breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s. The first-come-first-serve caf\u00e9 opened last Friday, at 10 A.M., and I\u2019d read that people had waited in line for two hours\u2014which seems insane by most standards but not, sadly, by those of New York restaurant-going, and I\u2019d cleared my morning. Standing on the opposite side of the street, waiting to cross, just after ten, I squinted and looked for a line, outside of either the Fifth Avenue entrance or the Fifty-seventh Street one, but I saw no one. Feeling triumphant\u2014the buzz must have died down quickly, I thought\u2014I marched toward the revolving doors and asked a bright-eyed young uniformed attendant how to get to the caf\u00e9. Bubble, burst: it\u2019s on the fourth floor, he graciously informed me\u2014but entirely booked for most of the day, on account of people showing up at 7 A.M. to start waiting. He suggested returning around three-thirty. \u201cBut you\u2019re welcome to head up there to get more information!\u201d he added.\n\nUpstairs, at the host stand, the prognosis was even worse. Two men of incredible poise, both in suits and one with a posh British accent, told me calmly what they must have told dozens of hopefuls before me: in fact, people had begun to line up at midnight, and coming back at three-thirty was a long shot, but I could try again tomorrow. About a dozen sad-looking young women in black tights and wool jackets stood listlessly against the railing that led to the stairs, peering into the dining room, where other young women were taking DSLR and iPhone photos of \u201cTiffany Tea,\u201d an assortment of finger sandwiches and sweets that arrive on a tiered stand. I asked to see a menu. Breakfast, at Tiffany, is a prix fixe (for twenty-nine dollars) that includes coffee or tea; a croissant with Nutella and honey butter; seasonal fruit; and your choice of a selection of entr\u00e9es ranging from truffled eggs with bacon to buttermilk waffles to, of course, avocado toast. \u201cGood morning, welcome, congratulations, you made it!\u201d I heard a chipper server say as he showed a group of four to their table. \u201cWe love your passion.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.newyorker.com/photos/68fa8c80567178f230e77786/4:3/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined",
