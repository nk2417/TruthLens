The 23-year-old British singer continued his Late Late Show residency on Wednesday night where he participated in a funny sketch with the show\u2019s host.\n\nWATCH: Harry Styles Delivers an Opening Monologue on \u2018The Late Late Show,\u2019 Discusses Side Effects of Going Solo\n\n\n\n\"Harry Styles and I have known each other for a long time, but what people might not know is that we've worked together many times,\u201d Corden explained. \u201cUnfortunately, our mutual love of singing has always gotten us into trouble.\u201d\n\nThe skit then cut to Corden and Styles as doctors in the operating room. They had an urgent surgery, but couldn\u2019t stop themselves from breaking into the Tom Jones\u2019 classic \u201cIt\u2019s Not Unusual.\u201d\n\nDecked out in scrubs, the pair performed synchronized dance moves as their patient went into shock and then died on the operating table while they were singing.\n\nAfter apologizing to their fellow doctors, Corden and Styles then exited the operating room to tell the patient\u2019s family, saying, \u201cBad news, guys!\u201d\n\nThe sketch then showed the pair serving as pallbearers at a funeral when they broke into the Lou Bega hit \u201cMambo No. 5.\u201d\n\nThe grieving funeral attendees weren\u2019t particularly pleased to see them dancing around the casket. Watch the clip to see what happens when they\u2019re trying to defuse a bomb!\n\nWATCH: Harry Styles Addresses Whether 'Two Ghosts' Is About Taylor Swift: 'It's Pretty Self-Explanatory'\n\n\n\nStyles also performed his new song, \u201cTwo Ghosts,\u201d on the show, which is rumored to be about his ex, Taylor Swift.\n\nFor more from Styles\u2019 residency, watch the clip below!", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/1280_james_corden_harry_styles_doctors_youtube.jpg?width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/1280_james_corden_harry_styles_doctors_youtube.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/1280_james_corden_harry_styles_doctors_youtube.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/217783_harry_styles_and_james_corden_can_t_stop_singing_and_dancing_at_inappropriate_times_watch", "title": "Harry Styles and James Corden Can't Stop Singing and Dancing at Inappropriate Times: Watch!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/1280_james_corden_harry_styles_doctors_youtube.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "'Mambo No. 5' is not a good funeral song.", "title": "Harry Styles and James Corden Can't Stop Singing and Dancing at Inappropriate Times: Watch!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/217783_harry_styles_and_james_corden_can_t_stop_singing_and_dancing_at_inappropriate_times_watch", "type": "Article"}, "description": "'Mambo No. 5' is not a good funeral song.", "twitter": {"description": "'Mambo No. 5' is not a good funeral song.", "title": "Harry Styles and James Corden Can't Stop Singing and Dancing at Inappropriate Times: Watch!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/217783_harry_styles_and_james_corden_can_t_stop_singing_and_dancing_at_inappropriate_times_watch", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/1280_james_corden_harry_styles_doctors_youtube.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Harry Styles and James Corden Can't Stop Singing and Dancing at Inappropriate Times: Watch! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , James Corden", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
