I\u2019ve been here a couple times and it never gets old.\n\nOprah: It\u2019s my first time here. And we came here to celebrate with Diane von Furstenberg\u2014for the Diane von Furstenberg Leadership Awards, where Diane had gathered women from all around the world who were doing extraordinary things in their lives.\n\nGayle: Prime ministers.\n\nOprah: Prime ministers.\n\nGayle: Former First Ladies.\n\nOprah: Yes, former First Ladies.\n\nGayle: Climate activists. It\u2019s the 15th anniversary, so it\u2019s a big deal for her.\n\nOprah: Women making changes against domestic violence, reproductive rights, all the things that matter in the world, and just sitting at the table, being around all those women is so inspiring, you leave feeling like, I need to do better in my own life.\n\nGayle: And also, you leave in awe of women, too\u2014what women can do, who we are, how we move in the world, and the changes we make...in most cases for the better.\n\nOprah: Most cases for the better. Yes. And one of the lines I loved about women is they\u2019re looking for change, not just power, but looking for, also, change, and so\u2026so inspired this week by being in the presence of people doing wonderful things, and I was just thinking about all of you being so supportive of us on O Daily. I want to know, what inspires you? And what changes do you want to make as we come to the end of the summer? This is it.\n\nGayle: I know.\n\nOprah: This is it!\n\nGayle: But it\u2019s been a good summer. Another line I liked from the lunch, somebody said, \u201cIt\u2019s not about passing the torch; it\u2019s about passing the truth.\u201d\n\nOprah: Yes.\n\nGayle: And that\u2019s what women do.\n\nOprah: That\u2019s what women do! Let us know what you think.\n\nGayle: Bye from Venice!\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images":
