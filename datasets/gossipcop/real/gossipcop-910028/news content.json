The straw that broke proverbial backs and sent many of you into full rage mode was Friday night's one-two punch of Magnum P.I. and Cagney and Lacey, both of which are getting \"updates\" via CBS pilot orders.\n\nThe chorus largely sang a song of, \"Why no new ideas?\"\n\nThere were those who questioned if any recasting of familiar roles could pass muster:\n\nAnd then a few of you had to wonder, \"Where does it end?\":\n\nHow \"new\" is this trend of turning the familiar into something slightly new-ish? Not very, though this year's pilot season sure has picked up the pace and suggested no immediate end in sight.[pmc_inline_gallery]\n\nAfter all, airing during this broadcast TV season alone, you have four reboots (from Hawaii Five-0 to Dynasty)... three revivals (including Roseanne)... 10 spinoffs (from grand-daddy NCIS to Young Sheldon) ... and another dozen shows that are based on preexisting properties/characters (including Gotham, Riverdale and Lethal Weapon). That's 29 broadcast-TV programs, out of about 100 scripted shows from this fall and midseason, that are varying degrees of \"not entirely original,\" based on/spun off of something. And going back five years, there have been a total of 105 on air.\n\nMeaning, while the recent reboot rampage may seem smothering and unusual, it is in a way something we have been tolerating \u2014 and viewership sometimes validating \u2014 for a while.", "images": ["https://www.tvline.com/img/TVLine-Icon-RGB-Default-Color.svg", "https://www.tvline.com/img/TVLine-Logo-RGB-Default-Color.svg", "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/news/tv-reboot-trend-remakes-charmed-magnum-pi-murphy-brown-cagney-lacey-909926/tv-reboot-backlash-charmed.jpg", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reboot-tweet-gless-daly.jpg?w=300", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reboot-tweet-insanity.jpg", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reboot-tweet-sigh.jpg?w=300", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reboot-tweet-fresh-ideas.jpg?w=300", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reboot-tweet-why.jpg", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reboot-tweet-awesome.jpg?w=300", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reboot-tweet-rehashing.jpg?w=300", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reboot-tweet-jeffersons.jpg", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reboot-tweet-selleck.jpg?w=300", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reboot-tweet-yes.jpg?w=300", "https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/reboot-tweet-stay-dead.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/news/tv-reboot-trend-remakes-charmed-magnum-pi-murphy-brown-cagney-lacey-909926/tv-reboot-backlash-charmed.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matt Webb Mitovich"], "canonical_link": "https://www.tvline.com/news/tv-reboot-trend-remakes-charmed-magnum-pi-murphy-brown-cagney-lacey-909926/", "title": "TV's Reboot And Revival Trend Draws Backlash: 'Stop The Insanity!'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "thumbnail": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/news/tv-reboot-trend-remakes-charmed-magnum-pi-murphy-brown-cagney-lacey-909926/tv-reboot-backlash-charmed.jpg", "description": "When it comes to TV's increasingly obstinate reboots, revivals and remakes trend, the public is officially recoiling.
