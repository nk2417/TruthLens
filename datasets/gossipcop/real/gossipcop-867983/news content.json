So who came out of the show looking best? Let\u2019s look back on how this year\u2019s show went.\n\nWinner \u2014 DC Wonder Woman did a lot to help the image of the DC movieverse, but all the drama of the past couple years doesn\u2019t go away easily. For the moment, at least, they made us forget with a Comic-Con trailer that looked much better than all the previous marketing and a glowing Ben Affleck on stage shooting down the rumors that he\u2019s on the way out as Batman. DC was a ton of fun.\n\nLoser \u2014 DC With the DC Extended Universe really ramping up now, it kinda sucks that DC doesn\u2019t get its own Hall H presentation separate from the rest of the Warner Bros slate. Marvel has a big leg up in that regard.\n\nLoser \u2014 \u201cBlade Runner 2049\u201d Another casualty of jamming the DC slate in with the rest of WB\u2019s lineup. For a nerd-aimed blockbuster to make a real splash in Hall H, it\u2019s gotta bring the goods, but Warner Bros didn\u2019t really do that with Blade Runner. They\u2019d already released a new trailer the Monday before Comic-Con, and there wasn\u2019t much to the brief clip that they showed. The return of \u201cBlade Runner\u201d is a huge deal, and it deserved better than a panel everybody had forgotten about an hour after it happened.\n\nWinner \u2014 David Lynch The \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d co-creator didn\u2019t show up for the Showtime revival\u2019s panel in Hall H, but he certainly left an impression with a bizarre but incredibly funny video message to fans.\n\nWinner \u2014 \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d There\u2019s an art to talking at length about your show without providing any details whatsoever but also not being boring \u2014 and the cast of \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d pulled it off. Showtime also did fans a real solid with an early screening of Part 11 on Friday night. It\u2019d be tough for a TV show to show up to Comic-Con any better than that.\n\nLoser \u2014 20th Century Fox Deadpool and X-Men were nowhere to be found in Hall H this year, much to the chagrin of the folks who has stayed up all night in line to see Fox\u2019s presentation.\n\nWinner \u2014 \u201cKingsman: The Golden Circle\u201d The absence of \u201cDeadpool\u201d was good for \u201cKingsman,\u201d though, which got the entirety of Fox\u2019s Hall H hour to serve up fun antics (like Halle Berry chugging a pint of bourbon) and some lengthy and really impressive clips.\n\nLoser \u2014 \u201cStar Wars\u201d \u201cStar Wars\u201d doesn\u2019t come to Comic-Con aside from merch booths on the show floor, but in 2016 you couldn\u2019t look in any direction without seeing somebody wearing \u201cStar Wars\u201d gear. This year, the amount of fans repping \u201cStar Wars\u201d was way, way down, indicating perhaps that enthusiasm for the mega-franchise has come back down to earth.\n\nLoser \u2014 \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d They came out and showed a very long trailer full of context-free shots, then a retrospective video, then went immediately to audience Q&A for the rest of the hour they had in Hall H. That\u2019s not exactly substantial content.\n\nWinner \u2014 Marvel Film Comic-Con is kinda hellish in a lot of ways, but Marvel\u2019s Saturday-night showcase never fails to make it all seem worth it. This year was definitely not an exception, with fans in Hall H being treated to spectacular and really substantial clips from \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d as well as the \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d sizzle reel they showed at D23 the week before. If I were to call any presentation the overall winner of SDCC 2017 it would be this one. But that\u2019s usually the case.\n\nWinner \u2014 \u201cThe Defenders\u201d Netflix really treated the fans in Hall H on Friday night, premiering the entire first episode of \u201cThe Defenders.\u201d And it was good! After a long day of mostly uneventful Hall H panels, it was a very welcome surprise.\n\nWinner \u2014 Netflix Aside from \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d Netflix showed off four minutes of its upcoming \u201cPunisher\u201d series and treated the Hall H crowd to some meaty clips from the films \u201cBright\u201d and \u201cDeath Note.\u201d Oh, and they also held a screening of \u201cDeath Note\u201d on Thursday night. Netflix really brought its A-game to Comic-Con this year.\n\nLoser \u2014 \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d Normally, Comic-Con takes place a months after the season has ended, meaning there isn\u2019t usually anything meaty for \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to bring. We\u2019d hoped that this year would be different, since the panel took place a week into season 7. But aside from a new short trailer, this year\u2019s \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d panel was as insubstantial as always. But, hey, at least Alfie Allen brought a puppy who is a good boy and won everything yes he did yes he did!", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Justice-League-Banner.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/twin-peaks-revival-bad-coop-kyle-maclachlan.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/SethLordCosplayComicConInstagramMoresweettea.jpg?resize=550%2C784&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cropped-Ross.jpg?resize=150%2C150&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sdbooth1.jpg?resize=600%2C600&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/julian-dennison-deadpool-2.png?resize=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/cropped-Ross.jpg?fit=58%2C58&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/blade-runner-2049-vegas-everything-we-learned.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Trump-and-Larry-Ellison.jpg?fit=300%2C169&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/winners-and-losers-of-comic-con-justice-league-thor-kingsman.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/winners-and-losers-of-comic-con-justice-league-thor-kingsman.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/thor-ragnarok-trailer-hulk-thor-pals-chris-hemsworth-mark-ruffalo.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325_COVER-_IR_5x4.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/netflix-logo.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/The-Defenders.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Justice-League-Batman-The-Flash-Wonder-Woman-Banner.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/JulianneMooreKingsman.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/david-lynch-twin-peaks.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/theon-game-of-thrones-puppy.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/walking-dead-season-8-trailer.png?resize=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/winners-and-losers-of-comic-con-justice-league-thor-kingsman.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Phil Owen", "Ross A.
