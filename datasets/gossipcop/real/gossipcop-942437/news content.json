Beginning with the 1960 Rat Pack film Ocean's 11, the series has seen mixed to favorable critical reception and substantial commercial success. After the 1960 film, a reboot trilogy was released from 2001 to 2007, often cited as defining its genre and leading to a proliferation and commercialization of heist films throughout the world.[1][2] The most commercially successful was the first film, Ocean's Eleven (2001). It established the ensemble cast of George Clooney as Danny Ocean, Matt Damon as Linus Caldwell, and Brad Pitt as Rusty Ryan. A long list of supporting cast members maintain the trilogy. The first sequel, Ocean's Twelve, was released in 2004, with the final film, Ocean's Thirteen, following in 2007. An all-female spin-off titled Ocean's 8 was released in 2018.\n\nOrigin [ edit ]\n\nThe Ocean's film series was inspired by and based on the 1960 heist film Ocean's 11. Directed by Lewis Milestone, with a script co-written by Harry Brown and Charles Lederer, from an original story and screenplay[3] by George Clayton Johnson and Jack Golden Russell; the movie starred five of the Rat Pack: Peter Lawford, Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., and Joey Bishop.[4]\n\nFilms [ edit ]\n\nOcean's Eleven (2001) [ edit ]\n\nMaster thief Danny Ocean (George Clooney), just out of prison, plans an elaborate Las Vegas three-casino-heist to win back his ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts). To that end, he recruits ten other thieves and con men to pull off the complex job, eventually stealing US$160 million.\n\nOcean's Twelve (2004) [ edit ]\n\nOcean's crew is blackmailed by the casino owner they stole from\u2014Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia)\u2014into paying him just over $198 million (their loot plus interest). The team is given two weeks to come up with the money so they travel to Europe to execute three heists.\n\nOcean's Thirteen (2007) [ edit ]\n\nOcean and his crew plan to rig a new casino's opening night to inflict ruinous losses after its ruthless owner Willy Bank (Al Pacino) double-crosses one of the gang, with plans to ruin his life.\n\nOcean's 8 (2018) [ edit ]\n\nSoderbergh and George Clooney initially downplayed the possibility of an Ocean's Fourteen or subsequent sequels after Bernie Mac's death in 2008.[5] Several years later, a new Ocean's Eleven spin-off with an all-female cast led by Sandra Bullock as the sister of George Clooney's Danny Ocean was put in development, conceived by producer Jerry Weintraub, Soderbergh and Clooney. Olivia Milch wrote the screenplay, and Gary Ross directed the film.[6][7] Helena Bonham Carter, Cate Blanchett, Mindy Kaling,[8][9][10] Anne Hathaway, Rihanna, Nora \"Awkwafina\" Lum[11] and Sarah Paulson star in the film.[12] The film was released in the United States on June 8, 2018.[13]\n\nFuture [ edit ]\n\nUntitled prequel film [ edit ]\n\nIn May 2022, a prequel film set in 1960s Europe was revealed to be in development, which will also connect to and incorporate elements from the original film,[14] and is intended to not be a reboot, but instead set within the established continuity.[15] Margot Robbie will star in and produce the project, while Jay Roach will direct with Carrie Solomon set to write the script. Roach and Tom Ackerley will additionally serve as producers alongside Robbie. The project will be a joint-venture production between Warner Bros. Pictures, LuckyChap Entertainment, and Village Roadshow Pictures.[16][17][14][18][19][20][15] Shortly after its initial announcement, Ryan Gosling entered early negotiations in August to co-star in the film, alongside Robbie.[21][22][23] In December 2023, it was revealed that the characters that Robbie and Gosling would be playing are the parents of Danny and Debbie Ocean (as portrayed by Clooney and Bullock, respectively).[24] The film's tentative production start date was for spring 2023, but was ultimately delayed due to the cast's production schedule.[25]\n\nIn July 2025, it was reported that Lee Isaac Chung was in talks to direct the film.[26] In October 2025, it was reported that Bradley Cooper was in talks to play the male lead, replacing Gosling. Chung was also confirmed to have officially signed on to direct.[27]\n\nOcean's Fourteen [ edit ]\n\nA sequel to Ocean's Thirteen had been in development until Bernie Mac's death. In June 2021, Don Cheadle revealed that Steven Soderbergh had been working on the concept of a sequel film. The following month, Matt Damon also expressed interest in returning to the franchise, while stating that the project was up to Soderbergh.[28][29] In December 2023, George Clooney revealed that the script for the film was completed and confirmed his involvement. He said that the story was comparable to Going in Style.[24] In September 2024, it was announced that Edward Berger was in early negotiations to direct the film, with Clooney and Brad Pitt reprising their roles from previous movies. Various recurring characters are expected to also return, while the movie will be a joint-venture production between Warner Bros. Pictures, and Smokehouse Pictures.[30] While Clooney and Pitt have confirmed that there is a script made, and both liked it, it was confirmed that there was no such discussion with Berger specifically.[31] In January 2025, it was reported that David Leitch was in talks to direct Ocean's Fourteen, with Damon and Casey Affleck set to return; Leitch and Pitt previously worked together on Bullet Train (2022).[32] In October 2025, George Clooney revealed that the budget was finalized by Warner Bros, and it would start shooting next year, with Roberts and Cheadle also expected to return, among others.[33]\n\nPotential crossover [ edit ]\n\nIn April 2023, Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney said during the Toronto International Film Festival that they had discussed a crossover sequel with the Magic Mike saga.[34][35]\n\nPrincipal cast and characters [ edit ]\n\nList indicators This section includes characters who will appear or have appeared in the series.
