On Friday, during a Q&A session after a preview screening of the film, Garner and Duhamel were asked how they\u2019d each handle it if their kids were to come out.\n\nAccording to People, Garner and Duhamel had no trouble fielding the question. \u201cI truly just want my kid to be happy and passionate about what it is that he loves,\u201d Duhamel said of his 4-year-old son (with ex-wife, singer Fergie). \u201cIf he came out he was gay, so be it, if that makes him happy. I truly believe that\u2019s what it would be and maybe it\u2019s because I waited awhile before I became a parent.\u201d\n\nRelated story Ben Affleck Reveals Which of His Kids Takes After Their 'Spectacular' Mom Jennifer Garner\n\nMore: Everyone Lost Their Cool Over Jennifer Garner\u2019s Oscars Dress\n\nGarner \u2014 who shares Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 5, with ex-husband Ben Affleck \u2014 told the audience at the session that her kids already like to talk about whether or not they might marry a man or a woman.
