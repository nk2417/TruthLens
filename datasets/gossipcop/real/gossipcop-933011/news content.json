Boyega later wrote on Instagram that, before they were famous, he and Wright, who both grew up in London, used to talk \u201cabout the future in McDonald\u2019s after drama classes.\u201d He ended the post with, \u201cLook at God and look at this amazing woman.\u201d\n\nSo we loved that story hard, but we were still confused. Friends? Lovers? What\u2019s up? Let\u2019s toss it to Wright.\n\nImage: Letitia Wright via Instagram\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nShe posted a video of herself posing solo on the carpet, and then she said, \u201cJohn, do you want to pose together?\u201d He appeared with her in the next video, which she captioned to make sure it was clear it is a platonic \u2014 or familial \u2014 situation.\n\nAll the attention they were getting online led to a second post from Wright about their being in the friend zone. She again used the \u201cbig bro\u201d bit and said he accompanied her \u201cso I wouldn\u2019t be nervous.\u201d\n\nAll that just made fans love them even more.\n\n@JohnBoyega & @letitiawright are not only friends (I did not know this before tonight), they also went to the #METGALA18 together and my heart is just bursting.
