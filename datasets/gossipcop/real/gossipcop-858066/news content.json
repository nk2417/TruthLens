(The show at the Troxy featured Rupaul\u2019s Drag Race alums Violet Chachki, Kim Chi, Shea Coulee, Shangela, Detox, and Sasha Velor, and was hosted by Drag Race panelist Michelle Visage.)\n\nThe 33-year-old Amazing Spider-Man star was enjoying the show from the audience when he suddenly hopped onstage during a segment called \u201cWig in a Box,\u201d in which he and three other members of the audience were called up to don wigs representing iconic singers and compete in a lip-sync battle. Garfield selected Whitney Houston, while the other three contestants pulled Cher, Dolly Parton, and Katy Perry.\n\n//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\n\nAn eyewitness told Entertainment Tonight that the Hollywood stud looked like he was having a blast as he rocked out with the curly brunette wig, dancing and lip-syncing his heart out to the 1992 hit. At one point, Garfield even did a back flip onstage, much to the delight of the audience.\n\nAfter the show, Visage tracked down the actor and shared a photo of herself sandwiched between him and Orange Is the New Black star Laverne Cox.\n\n//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js\n\n\u201cAndrew Garfield, you are my new friend, I am SO proud of you for not just lip syncing Whitney tonight in a wig no less, but for opening your mind and heart to all it has to offer,\u201d she captioned the image.\n\nTrending Stories \u2018Faith Is Under Attack': Nicki Minaj Spreads Misleading Information at the United Nations 2025 CMA Awards: The Complete Winners List Neighbor Indicted in Murder of \u2018King of the Hill\u2019 Star Jonathan Joss Is This Mysterious U.K. Rapper Actually Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet?\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Garfield has dressed in drag, however. In 2014, the Hacksaw Ridge actor donned a long blonde wig and a lace white dress as part of Arcade Fire\u2019s music video for \u201cWe Exist.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-645896240-1-156c5af3-2d3d-4272-9bfc-0dd4507b7285.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-645896240-1-156c5af3-2d3d-4272-9bfc-0dd4507b7285.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/watch-andrew-garfields-drag-performance-of-whitney-houstons-im-every-woman-125950/", "title": "Watch Andrew Garfield's Drag Performance of 'I'm Every Woman'", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Andrew Garfield impressed with a lipsync performance of Whitney Houston's \"I'm Every Woman\" at the London stop of the drag revue Werq the World", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Joyce Chen", "tags": "Andrew Garfield, RuPaul's Drag Race", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Watch Andrew Garfield's Drag Performance of Whitney's 'I'm Every Woman'", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/watch-andrew-garfields-drag-performance-of-whitney-houstons-im-every-woman-125950/", "description": "Andrew Garfield impressed with a lipsync performance of Whitney Houston's \"I'm Every Woman\" at the London stop of the drag revue Werq the World", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-645896240-1-156c5af3-2d3d-4272-9bfc-0dd4507b7285.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "width": 1600, "height": 900, "alt": "Andrew Garfield Dons Wig and \u2018Werq\u2019s It Lipsyncing to Whitney Houston\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m Every Woman\u2019: Watch"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-01T01:01:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-05-07T15:45:50+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Andrew Garfield impressed with a lipsync performance of Whitney Houston's \"I'm Every Woman\" at the London stop of the drag revue Werq the World", "site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Watch Andrew Garfield\u2019s Drag Performance of Whitney Houston\u2019s \u2018I\u2019m Every Woman\u2019", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-645896240-1-156c5af3-2d3d-4272-9bfc-0dd4507b7285.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/hRXc_-c_9Xc?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-US&autohide=2&wmode=transparent"], "publish_date": 1496278860.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
