I could not have done with this without you. I\u2019ll never be able to thank you guys enough.\u201d\n\nTyler cited her busy schedule as the reason for her departure. Aside from her gig on the talk show, she also hosts Whose Line Is It Anyway?, acts on Criminal Minds and voices a character on animated series Archer. \u201cPeople always go \u2018How to you do all that?\u2019, and I don\u2019t always have an answer,\u201d she said. Of her latest gig as the director of a feature film, she added: \u201cI knew that was what I wanted to do the rest of my life, what I wanted to put my energy into. And I started to think about it and could not see how that would work.\u201d\n\nThe fan-favorite talk show is also hosted by Sharon Osbourne, Julie Chen, Sara Gilbert and Sheryl Underwood. Despite their frequent heated discussions on trending topics, the cohosts have proven time and time again that they support one another. When the actress was going through her divorce from Jeff Tietjens, the five women had a raw discussion about her heartbreak on the show\u2019s Monday, April 18, episode.\n\nRelated: Talk Show Controversies and Feuds: The Biggest Ever Take a look at some of the biggest controversies and feuds in talk show history, from Star Jones' falling-out with Barbara Walters on The View, to Matt Lauer and Ann Curry's Today show drama, to David Letterman's sex scandal and extortion plot\n\n\u201cEven though we\u2019re separating, all I want for him is joy and fulfillment in whatever he chooses to do in his life next. And whatever I can do to help him do that, I want to do it,\u201d the actress said of her husband of 20 years. \u201cI don\u2019t, not in any way, see this relationship as a failure. I was with this extraordinary person. I had this extraordinary love affair for 25 years of my life. And that is how I see it.\u201d Breaking down in tears, Tyler added: \u201cHe\u2019s a wonderful person. He\u2019s been my best friend for almost my entire life. I\u2019ll always, always love him.\u201d\n\nRelated: Best Dressed TV Show Hosts From Ellen DeGeneres to Maria Menounos, these news show hosts know how to balance professional attire with true
