Earlier in the day as she greeted crowds outside Newcastle\u2019s Civic Centre she made her way along to a group of school children who had been waiting excitedly all morning for a glimpse of the Royal. Among them was 10-year-old Terry who had vowed to get a hug from the Duchess \u2013 even maybe a kiss. And he was far from disappointed when his moment arrived. As the Duchess made her way along to the cheeky youngster he immediately held his arms out wide. The Duchess then asked him: \u2018Am I going to get a cuddle as well?\u2019 Without a seconds thought she leant forward over the steel barrier and embraced the schoolboy. \u2018It was good,\u2019 he said, still slightly stunned by his first encounter with royalty. \u2018I was hoping to get a hug from her when we came here this morning. \u2018I never actually thought it would happen. I can\u2019t believe she hugged me back. \u2018She was everything I thought she would be. She was really nice.\u2019 A school friend interrupted: \u2018The one thing he really wanted though was a kiss.\u2019\n\nAmong them was 10-year-old Terry Campbell who had vowed to get a hug from the Duchess\n\n\n\nAs the Duchess made her way along to the cheeky youngster he immediately held his arms out wide\n\n\n\nWithout a seconds thought she leant forward over the steel barrier and embraced the schoolboy\n\n\n\nVIDEO: The luckiest boy in Newcastle...a huge hug from Kate!\n\nUnfortunately for Terry he missed out on a kiss but the school pupil from Morpeth Road Primary School in Blyth, Northumberland, is unlikely to ever forget the day he shared a cuddle with the future Queen.\n\nHe was among 11 pupils from the school who were taken on the trip to Newcastle to see the Duchess.\n\nHis teacher Kim Ramsey, 32, said: \u2018I never imagined when we set off this morning that terry would actually get a hug from Kate.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think there was much planning that went into it. We asked the children to come up with a question for her and he decided he was going to ask for a hug.\n\n\u2018He\u2019s such a cheeky little lad. He just said: \u2018I\u2019m going to stick my hands out and get a hug.\u2019\n\n\u2018I never thought she\u2019d actually agree to it. It was a wonderful moment.\u2019\n\nKate was delighted to spend time in the gardens with the children\n\nKate played with the local children who were dressed in plastic ponchos to keep clean and dry\n\nElswick Park was just one of the venues that the Duchess visited on her first solo engagement to the North East\n\nWrite caption here\n\nKate chose a burgundy wool coat worn cinched in with large buckled belt and her favourite suede knee high boots for the visit to Newcastle\n\n\n\nSchoolboy Terry appeared almost lost for words when asked what it had been like to hug a real-life princess.\n\n\n\n'I was hoping to get a hug from her when we came here this morning,' Terry said KATE RECYCLES ANOTHER WINTER WARMER\n\nAnother official engagement = another recycled dress coat for Kate, the queen of thrifty chic. And this three-quarter length berry-coloured coat has special significance in the Duchess's wardrobe. Kate chose the deep burgundy piece for her first Christmas day at Sandringham as wife of William, where she was spotted making another little boy's day as she left Sandringham Church after the traditional Christmas Day service last year. The high-necked jacket was reported to be made by an independent British designer and Kate wore a hat in a matching wine coloured velvet by Jane Corbett, one of the Middleton family's favourite milliners. Hat's a winner: Another happy young fan greets the Duchess on a sunny Christmas day in 2011\n\n\n\nThe royal visit is Kate\u2019s first official trip to the North East, and speaking ahead of the visit, the Lord Mayor said: 'This is indeed an honour for the whole city and it will give us an opportunity to showcase our talents in education, sport and science as well as our international work.' The Duchess\u2019 first engagement was at Newcastle Civic Centre where a range of people - from those who contributed to making the Olympic Games a success in Newcastle to volunteers who help make the city centre a more welcoming place for people and businesses - were waiting to meet her. Inside Newcastle Civic Centre, Kate met representatives from a number of community organisations which have been helping residents and businesses and working to improve life generally in the city. She even tried her hand at the Paralympic sport of boccia, a form of bowls, when she joined two disabled players in motorised wheelchairs from the local Percy Hedley School, which teaches children with cerebral palsy and motor disorders. The Duchess sat between Michael Bell, 17, from Durham, and Richard Armstrong, 16, from Birmingham. As she was handed a red bowl, she said: 'The pressure\u2019s on' and predicted it would 'go rolling off the carpet.' Her first effort hit the white jack ball and stopped six inches away but Richard proved to be the master of the game, making a succession of throws which hit or came close to the target. Kate\u2019s second effort sailed past the jack but her third and final throw made her gasp as it came within a whisker of hitting the target before rolling two feet away. Michael, who performed a little worse than the Duchess with his bowls, conceded: 'She was doing better than what I was doing, but she should come down and see some of our other sports like wheelchair basketball.' The Duchess of Cambridge carried out a string of solo engagements in Newcastle without the Duke, who is attending the funeral of his former nanny Speaking ahead of kate's visit the Lord Mayorof Newcastle, Councillor Jackie Slesenger said: 'This is indeed an honour for the whole city and it will give us an opportunity to showcase our talents in education, sport and science as well as our international work.'\n\nThe royal visit is Kate's first official trip to the North East The Duchess\u2019 first engagement was at Newcastle Civic Centre where a range of people including those who contributed to making the Olympic Games a success in Newcastle were waiting to meet her.\n\nKate took part in a ball throwing exercise with Richard Armstrong (L) and Michael Bell from Percy Hedley school Kate continued her visit to the North East by meeting community groups and school children in Elswick Park, Newcastle. She was greeted by 200 children and members of the public who were waving flags and cheering.\n\nSome of the children also passed her gifts, including flowers and jam. Kate was shown around a community garden and helped plant some seeds before continuing through the park. A plaque was then unveiled and a girl from a local school presented the Duchess with a bouquet of flowers. The park is protected under the Queen Elizabeth II Fields Challenge, which seeks to protect and create hundreds of playing fields across the country. The community garden was set up in 2009 to give girls and young women the chance to learn how to grow vegetables and plants. Kate revealed to community garden Emma Hughes that like thousands of keen gardeners around the country, she grows her own veg. Ms Hughes said after the visit: 'She grows her own potatoes in sacks. We were digging the potatoes and she was asking about it. She said ours were bigger. She said she only got small ones this year.' Elswick Park is protected under the Queen Elizabeth II Field Challenge During her visit to thepark Kate admitted that she grew her own potatoes to community farmer Emma Hughes, and that her crop had been small this year\n\nWrite caption here Kate unveiled a plaque in the sunshine in pretty Elswick Park\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge smiled as she arrived for a visit to a community garden project at Elswick Park in Newcastle\n\n\n\nKate met with royal fans - young and old - who had waited for hours for a glimpse of her\n\n\n\nIt was Kate's third official engagement in three days but the royal
