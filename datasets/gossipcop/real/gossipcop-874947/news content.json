They briefly released songs after that under the name 78Violet, but it\u2019s been long ten years since the duo released a song as Aly & AJ. Last Friday, the two sisters debuted a new single, \u201cTake Me,\u201d according to E! News.\n\nOver the last decade, the former child stars went for acting. Aly, 28, is married to Stephen Ringer and stars on iZombie. While AJ, 26, is a series regular on the sitcom The Goldbergs.\n\nIn a recent interview with Elle, the Michalka sisters opened up about what happened, where they\u2019ve been and what brought them back to their music career.\n\n\u201cMy husband encouraged us to come back to music,\u201d Aly explained. \u201cHe saw us singing and writing round the house so he encouraged us to get back out there and write music and perform\u2026[Finally] we just said, \u2018Okay, let\u2019s give this one last go.'\u201d\n\nThe pair then called out their good friend and songwriter Mike Elizondo and started to settle things.\n\n\u201cThe music we were writing then was based on fictional relationships. We were thirteen and fifteen, we were writing with zero experience,\u201d Aly said referring to their new and mature sound. \u201cNow that I\u2019m married, and we\u2019ve each had many relationships and heartbreaks, we\u2019re coming at songwriting at a much different way.\u201d\n\nAJ also talked about what it was like to be a child star. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were [in the] mega stardom field, but I do know that our music had done well enough that Aly and I were recognized on a day-to-day basis, especially if we were together,\u201d the sitcom star revealed.\n\nShe added, \u201cYou deal with constant scrutiny, and people who know your business too intimately who shouldn\u2019t. As a kid, it can be overwhelming and frightening. Now that we\u2019re older, I feel safer. I know how to handle it better. Had we been bigger at that age, it can be really freaky and possibly damaging.\u201d\n\nThe younger sister admits that she\u2019s thankful they\u2019re not superstars. \u201cHad we been bigger at that age, it can be really freaky and possibly damaging. I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t experience Taylor Swift-level fame because I don\u2019t know how that would work,\u201d the actress shared. \u201cThankfully we had each other; I can\u2019t imagine it as a solo artist. [Even] growing up with super-normal parents and a solid team around us, being under the microscope is definitely a weird way to grow up.\u201d\n\nAly also said that she was completely open for a Phil of the Future reunion. \u201cI mean, sure! I guess reunions are a big thing now. I wouldn\u2019t be opposed to it. It\u2019s a funny idea. I have no idea what they\u2019d do necessarily with the storyline, but yeah, sure.\u201d\n\nAly & AJ\u2019s four-song EP is scheduled to be released before a full album in 2018.", "images": ["https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/plugins/td-standard-pack/Newspaper/assets/images/no-thumb/td_324x235.png", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/plugins/td-standard-pack/Newspaper/assets/images/no-thumb/td_100x70.png", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAArgAAAQUAQAAAAC6tVctAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAABwSURBVHja7cGBAAAAAMOg+VNf4AhVAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB8A2bvAAEVsnnrAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/logo_transparent_background_small.png", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_8827857bm-696x1044.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAGQAAABGAQAAAAAS/QzEAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAAARSURBVCjPY2AYBaNgFAwnAAAD1AABFoSmGgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAUQAAADrAQAAAAA5rNLkAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAAAgSURBVGje7cExAQAAAMKg9U9tCF+gAAAAAAAAAAAA4DUmjgABJL9g0QAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAKoAAABxAQAAAABt9AXDAAAAAnRSTlMAAHaTzTgAAAAZSURBVEjH7cGBAAAAAMOg+VMf4ApVAQDAGQonAAE7Zv49AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_8827857bm.jpg"], "top_img": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_8827857bm.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Pie L"], "canonical_link": "https://omgcheckitout.com/aly-aj-michalka-opened-10-year-break-music/", "title": "Aly and AJ Michalka Opened Up About Their 10-Year Break From Music", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Aly Michalka and her younger sister AJ Michalka had a certified hit \"Potential Breakup Song\" in 2007, which was named Time\u2019s 9th best song of the year.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "Aly and AJ Michalka Opened Up About Their 10-Year Break From Music", "description": "Aly Michalka and her younger sister AJ Michalka had a certified hit \"Potential Breakup Song\" in 2007, which was named Time\u2019s 9th best song of the year.", "site_name": "OMG Check It Out !", "image": {"identifier": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/shutterstock_8827857bm.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 3000, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "url": "https://omgcheckitout.com/aly-aj-michalka-opened-10-year-break-music/", "type": "article"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/omgcheckitout", "published_time": "2017-08-22T23:46:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-24T05:58:26+00:00"}, "author": "Pie L", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@OMG_CheckItOut", "site": "@OMG_CheckItOut", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Pie L", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "theme-color": "#bc2025"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503445600.0, "source": "https://omgcheckitout.com", "summary": ""}
