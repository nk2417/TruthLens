Her death was ruled a suicide.\n\nThe case against Carrey was dismissed on January 25th, according to the website of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County.\n\nCarrey\u2019s attorneys did not immediately reply to multiple requests for comment.\n\nMs White\u2019s husband, Mark Burton, and her mother, Brigid Sweetman, had sued Carrey in 2016, claiming he was responsible for Ms White\u2019s death by drug overdose after he allegedly provided the drugs to her.\n\nCarrey and Ms White had been dating for three years prior to her death.\n\n\u201cShe was a truly kind and delicate Irish flower, too sensitive for this soil, to whom loving and being loved was all that sparkled,\u201d Carrey told local media at the time of her death.\n\nAfter Ms White\u2019s death, it was revealed that she had been married to Mr Burton since 2013.", "images": ["https://cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sandbox.irishtimes/NBZTERI3LJCBNBYCBPDZJLZMV4.png", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/7XU2BVHELRCJNKZAKRR4XCF3HE.jpg?smart=true&auth=d71afd0e65e76a045572c2130f0bb12e369c9e38bbf4f62ee65a5b6f10a3adb5&width=274&height=154", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8946263&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/irishtimes/1647534191733.svg", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/WAFMMOWCRFFSBOQBJLDXYX7UOQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=5b4893a9db6b84913d80c184ef724a01d5531e3fd2783bd12118212306ea8eec&width=274&height=154", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/7VKDF5OJ6ZEAPBSI3GK3PCUDRM.jpg?smart=true&auth=18b41a51b975ae12cf8d01cf5bb74fc24a8c71015242a2e24b7ed2d52bdf0994&width=274&height=154", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/HFDLLK4ACR3JXOKS4RMKYR3MSA.jpg?smart=true&auth=f50f0fe542e2c2708ec0d51d4cadbab870e9b3d9a27b02abc73a784b217c9cf5&width=274&height=154", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/YZ3PSALZBFAONLXSWVTNZHYFYY.JPG?focal=3302%2C3139&auth=81535358129f19278be137dea844020e2829a3f966486c661d78dcc04692a46f&width=274&height=154", "https://www.irishtimes.com/pf/resources/get-it-on-google-play.png?d=201", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/D4HI7DIPTFNSBOSKSJI7RZT5SY.jpg?smart=true&auth=d2bdae16a952812d92ec476ea50ff1b97d5d8c63164c43689ccce08ce56f4b29&width=274&height=154", "https://www.irishtimes.com/pf/resources/download-on-the-app-store.png?d=201", "https://www.irishtimes.com/pf/resources/logo-white.svg?d=201", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/FNBIGXTLNYQSX52NJEFY4Q6JUY.jpg?smart=true&auth=6f60179a5cf05c6bf8baefba7fbfa60b0de42c163db1774bf949a0c776b78dd9&width=1200&height=630", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/FRAVATHL2R5QLDQBMO7FJKBOVI.jpg?focal=4005%2C767&auth=a59475f92e7a4bf4841f91742874d85c26271838edf1fe7202e7556517fb78f4&width=274&height=154", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/FNBIGXTLNYQSX52NJEFY4Q6JUY.jpg?auth=6f60179a5cf05c6bf8baefba7fbfa60b0de42c163db1774bf949a0c776b78dd9&smart=true&width=1024&height=575", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/NZXTY5GP5FDDJHZFZ2MJDDRVKI.jpg?smart=true&auth=180c698a2c2bdf879e0861b99218243adddfb1fa914cf811189926c02f4328e4&width=274&height=154", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/7FHEWBJYGBFKZAB3JBGKTDKSJ4.JPG?smart=true&auth=6a9c4890630bccb60e2853ab8834231ff4442cc98f6ba6aa8a07da4fb18ba399&width=274&height=154", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/A4J4WW4MPUV4IQ5ED25BCHNJOQ.jpg?focal=2034%2C1725&auth=33d84625c19cfcdb449579a63deaa59017c1fa8fef866968d4cc1d8748c9c09d&width=274&height=154"], "top_img": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/FNBIGXTLNYQSX52NJEFY4Q6JUY.jpg?smart=true&auth=6f60179a5cf05c6bf8baefba7fbfa60b0de42c163db1774bf949a0c776b78dd9&width=1200&height=630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tracy Garza", "Thu Feb -"], "canonical_link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/crime-and-law/jim-carrey-will-not-face-trial-over-cathriona-white-death-1.3377111", "title": "Jim Carrey will not face trial over Cathriona White death", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Superior Court of Los Angeles County confirms case against actor dismissed", "twitter": {"description": "Superior Court of Los Angeles County confirms case against actor dismissed", "title": "Jim Carrey will not face trial over Cathriona White death", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/v2/FNBIGXTLNYQSX52NJEFY4Q6JUY.jpg?smart=true&auth=6f60179a5cf05c6bf8baefba7fbfa60b0de42c163db1774bf949a0c776b78dd9&width=1200&height=630", "alt": "Cathr\u00edona White and Jim Carrey pictured together in Manhattan.
