Although the actress and her funny man have known each other for a decade, it wasn't until 2021 that they settled down, squashed all the speculation, and welcomed a child together, tying the knot three years later in an intimate ceremony with their son.\n\nDetails of their relationship emerged soon after the comedian had checked out of rehab and separated from his wife of six years. Given the rapid sequence of events, news outlets questioned the pair's relationship timeline.\n\nMunn responded to critics, telling the Los Angeles Times, \"It's definitely not foreign for me to have people speculate incorrectly about things and to have rumors run rampant in one way. They think they know our relationship so well. When in reality, they don't. There's no way anyone could know what any of his relationships were or what our relationship is.\"\n\nHere's a look back at Olivia Munn and John Mulaney's relationship.\n\nSeptember 1, 2013: Olivia Munn and John Mulaney first meet.\n\nDuring an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Mulaney shared that he met Munn for the first time at the late-night host and SNL alum's wedding to Alexi Ashe.\n\nIn 2015, Munn shared her side of the story, telling HuffPost Live that she was \"obsessed with hanging out with and talking to\" Mulaney that night. \"We were at a wedding together, and I was like, 'Oh my gosh, do you and your fianc\u00e9e want to go have dinner or something and go hang out?'\" she said.\n\nDecember 21, 2020: Olivia Munn supports John Mulaney checking into rehab.\n\nAfter reports that Mulaney checked into rehab, Munn offered her support on Twitter with a since-deleted message accompanied by a heart and lightning bolt emoji, \"Sending SO MUCH love and support to John Mulaney. You got this.\"\n\nJune 26, 2021: Olivia Munn and John Mulaney are first spotted together.\n\nLess than two months after Mulaney and his wife, Anna Marie Tendler, announced their separation, People published the first photos of Munn and Mulaney together. \"I am heartbroken that John has decided to end our marriage,\" Tendler said in a statement to Page Six. \"I wish him support and success as he continues his recovery.\"\n\nThe couple officially divorced in July.\n\nMunn and Mulaney were seen at Rick's Drive In & Out in Los Angeles. Mulaney told Meyers that he moved to Los Angeles in the spring of 2021. Fans spotted Munn at Mulaney's comedy shows, too.\n\n\"Olivia and John are going strong,\" a source told Us Weekly. \"She has been sneaking into some of his shows and loves them ... Olivia is so smitten.\"\n\nSeptember 7, 2021: Olivia Munn and John Mulaney are expecting.\n\nThe biggest news during Mulaney's appearance with Meyers was that he and Munn were expecting.\n\n\"I'm gonna be a dad ... we're both really, really happy,\" he said. \"You guys saved me from drugs, and Olivia and this baby have helped save me from myself in this early journey out of recovery. And yeah, I don't have a joke for that. I'm really grateful to you.\"\n\nMunn told Access Daily that she was feeling great after the news broke. \"Just the outpouring of love and support has been really amazing,\" she said. \"There has been a really big mom tribe that comes up. I've heard about it, but they really come up in full force. There's a really great dad tribe, too, everyone comes up is really supportive, and it means so much to me.\"\n\nOctober 2021: Olivia Munn and John Mulaney spark breakup rumors.\n\nRumors of a breakup start to swirl online, though neither Munn nor Mulaney commented. A source told Us Weekly that the relationship was \"imperfect,\" but the couple saw each other as works in progress.\n\n\"Even though Olivia's going to be a wonderful mother and has great support behind her, Olivia's friends just don't see these two being a couple in a year's time,\" the source said. \"Olivia and John still have to decide what kind of future they're going to have together, if any. It's a time of uncertainty for both of them.\"\n\nA second source added, \"Becoming a mom was always more important to her than settling down in a conventional way. She's a real feminist and doesn't need a man by her side 24/7. She never has.\"\n\nNovember 24, 2021: Olivia Munn and John Mulaney welcome a son.\n\nMunn and Mulaney welcomed their first child together, a son named Malcolm Hi\u1ec7p Mulaney, in November 2021. However, the two kept the news to themselves until the holidays.\n\n\"Meet Malcolm Hi\u1ec7p Mulaney. He has his whole life ahead of him. He hasn't even tried seltzer yet,\" Mulaney shared in an Instagram post on December 24. \"I'm very in love with him and his whole deal. Happy Holidays.\"\n\nJune 26, 2022: Olivia Munn and John Mulaney head to New York City.\n\nInstagram @oliviamunn\n\nThe family of three visited N.Y.C., where Mulaney performed stand-up at Madison Square Garden.\n\n\"Being a father has certainly changed his perspective on life in that he realizes he has another human to take care of, so he wants to be the best dad he can be and just be healthy and present for him,\" a source told Us Weekly.\n\nThe source added, \"Olivia's fully embracing motherhood and all its challenges and ups and downs.\"\n\nJune 18, 2023: Olivia Munn and John Mulaney celebrate Father's Day as a family.\n\nInstagram @johnmulaney\n\nTwo years after Munn and Mulaney were first spotted together, they were celebrating Father's Day as a family with baby Malcolm. To capture the sweet moment, Mulaney posted an Instagram photo with the caption, \"You made me a dad, Olivia. I love you forever for doing that.\"\n\n\n\nJanuary 9, 2024: Olivia Munn and John Mulaney hit the red carpet.\n\nThe couple made their red carpet debut for the 14th annual Governors Awards in Los Angeles. Munn wore an ivory matching set by MATICEVSKI while Mulaney went the tried and true route with a classic black tuxedo.\n\nMichael Buckner/Getty Images\n\nMarch 13, 2024: Olivia Munn announces her breast cancer diagnosis.\n\nThat spring, Munn took to Instagram to share that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2023. Her treatment involved four surgeries (she later went on to have a fifth), including a double mastectomy.\n\n\"I'm so thankful to my friends and family for loving me through this,\" she wrote in her caption. \"I'm so thankful to John for the nights he spent researching what every operation and medication meant and what side effects and recovery I could expect. For being there before I went into each surgery and being there when I woke up, always placing framed photos of our little boy Malcolm so it would be the first thing I saw when I opened my eyes.\u201d\n\n\n\nOne month later, Munn shared with People just how supportive Mulaney had been throughout her journey:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he had a moment to himself, between being an incredibly hands-on father and going to and from the hospital \u2014 taking Malcolm to the park, putting him to nap, driving to Cedars-Sinai, hanging out with me, going home, putting Malcolm to bed, coming back to me,\" she said. \"And he did it all happily.\u201d\n\nInstagram @oliviamunn\n\nJuly 10, 2024: Olivia Munn and John Mulaney tie the knot.\n\nIn an intimate ceremony with just two guests\u2014that is, two-year-old Malcolm and an adult witness\u2014Munn and Mulaney tied the knot over the 4th of July holiday weekend. The couple's tiny wedding took place at a friend's house in New York.\n\nAugust 13, 2024: John Mulaney confirms his marriage to Olivia Munn.\n\nOne month after their wedding, Mulaney confirmed the nuptials with an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers: \"I got married,\" he said. \"Marrying into a large Vietnamese family is one of the most fun things I've ever done.\"\n\nHaving grown up in an Irish Catholic household, Mulaney said, Munn's family is a breath of fresh air.\n\n\u201cThe Luong family, they talk about anything immediately upon meeting you,\u201d he said, in contrast to his own family. \u201cLike, \u2018How much money you have? Why you so skinny?' Yeah. And they're the greatest.\u201d\n\n\n\nSeptember 14, 2024: The couple welcome a daughter.\n\nInstagram @oliviamunn\n\nIn a surprise announcement made via Instagram, Mulaney and Munn shared that they had quietly welcomed a second child via gestational surrogate. \"M\u00e9i June Mulaney was born on September 14, the year of the dragon,\" Munn wrote.\n\n\"I had so many profound emotions about not being able to carry my daughter,\" Munn continued. \"When I first met our gestational surrogate we spoke mother to mother. She showed me so much grace and understanding, I knew I had found a real-life angel. Words cannot express my gratitude that she kept our baby safe for 9 months and made our dreams come true.\"\n\n", "images":
