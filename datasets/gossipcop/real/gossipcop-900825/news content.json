Social media was like, \u2018B***h, you better bring your butt back.'\"\n\n\u201cI came back first, because they were saying that, and then also [because] I'm a businessperson and want this brand to continue as long as it can, so if that means me coming back to keep it going, I'm there,\u201d she added.\n\nThe 44-year-old supermodel\u2019s return comes amid changes to the long-running show, with Banks sharing how viewers can expect a more diverse group of models. For the first time, contestants over the age of 27 will also be allowed to compete.\n\n\u201cWe have girls in their 30s, girls in their 40s,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have more curvy girls than ever, we have a girl that has alopecia -- she has no hair on her head. I also came back because I felt that there was a need to continue to push the barriers of beauty and to do it on a big scale.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that's my mission and why I get up every single day -- to expand the definition,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was a very skinny young girl and then my booty expanded and being a black girl and [having] all these things I had to surmount \u2026 I wanted to bring that to Top Model and I think Top Model has really opened the door to show that beauty is not just a cookie-cutter, but there's still more work to be done, darling.\u201d\n\nOne thing remains the same this season -- the presence of modeling phrases coined by Banks, which have become known as \u201cTyra-isms.\u201d In fact, there\u2019s a hip, new one in the mix in coming episodes!\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have touching \u2026 isolating the body and only using the booty for movement,\u201d Banks explained. \u201cAnd smizing -- smize smize smize -- and H2T, which means head-to-toe. And we have our new one, #NLF -- next level fierce, honey.\u201d\n\nWhile Banks is one busy woman, her 2-year-old son York, with ex-partner Erik Asla, is never far, even on set.\n\n\"I have a nursery down the hall that has pictures on the walls and a bright rug and crib and all of that, so York comes all the time,\" she shared.\n\nSee Banks talk more about motherhood below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2021-05/MODEL_VACATION_HERO.png?h=b0ef5550&width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/tyrabanks.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/tyra_banks_nup_179995_1213.jpg?h=80641bbb", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/tyra_banks_nup_179995_1213.jpg?h=80641bbb", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/tyra-banks-returning-americas-next-top-model-her-new-tyra-ism-exclusive-93949", "title": "Tyra Banks on Returning to 'America's Next Top Model' & Her New Tyra-ism (Exclusive)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/tyra_banks_nup_179995_1213.jpg?h=80641bbb", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "She's back and fiercer than ever!", "title": "Tyra Banks on Returning to 'America's Next Top Model' & Her New Tyra-ism (Exclusive)", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/tyra-banks-returning-americas-next-top-model-her-new-tyra-ism-exclusive-93949", "type": "Article"}, "description": "She's back and fiercer than ever!", "twitter": {"description": "She's back and fiercer than ever!", "title": "Tyra Banks on Returning to 'America's Next Top Model' & Her New Tyra-ism (Exclusive)", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/tyra-banks-returning-americas-next-top-model-her-new-tyra-ism-exclusive-93949", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/tyra_banks_nup_179995_1213.jpg?h=80641bbb", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Tyra Banks on Returning to 'America's Next Top Model' & Her New Tyra-ism (Exclusive) | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, Tyra Banks", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
