The 24-year-old singer was photographed in a black dress on Tuesday that was made shockingly sheer under the camera flashes.\n\nE! News reported on Selena\u2019s little black dress , which showed off her slim figure in ways she may not have anticipated.\n\n\u201cThe former Disney star rocked a skin-tight, see-through black dress that left little to the imagination.\u201d\n\nAll eyes were on the high-profile couple as Gomez walked to dinner with The Weeknd following his concert in New York City. The site quoted a source who witnessed the couple dining at the popular Carbone restaurant as Selena\u2019s outfit is said to have turned heads.\n\n\u201cA source dished some details about the couple\u2019s evening and couldn\u2019t help but comment on Gomez\u2019s style, noting that \u2018what she was wearing turned heads when she walked in and out.\u2019\u201d\n\nTMZ also picked up on the headline as the site told Gomez to \u201c beware the camera flash (NSFW) \u201d as it was apparent she opted to go braless during this particular date night.\n\n\u201cLooks like the only support Selena Gomez is getting these days is from her bf, The Weeknd\u2026 based on the braless shots of her leaving dinner in NYC.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BVDOuBhA9Va/\n\nTMZ went on to mention another time Gomez was spotted in a sheer black ensemble back in 2015 as she must now know flashing lights would cause her little black dress to become see-through.\n\n\u201cOn the way out, the paps started snapping\u2026 and the flashes turned her little black dress see-through. It\u2019s the curse of the LBD, really\u2026 and Selena knows it well.\u201d\n\nThe Weeknd, real name Abel Tesfaye, shared a PG-rated image of Gomez during their New York date night to his Instagram. In just eight hours, the photo received over 1 million likes. Abel simply captioned the post \u201cglow\u201d as Selena\u2019s face captures the lights of the restaurant.\n\nHis followers also commented things such as \u201cqueen\u201d and \u201cgoals\u201d on the post as they expressed support of the relationship. One Instagram user even stated that dating The Weeknd has changed Selena as they implied it as a positive thing. Others informed Tesfaye and Gomez they should stay together long term.\n\n\u201cYa\u2019ll belong together foreverrr.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BU-mlF0AbEU/\n\nIndeed, it appears as if the couple is enjoying one another\u2019s company quite a bit as they continue to be spotted in public together. Selena was photographed attending The Weeknd\u2019s international concerts before taking a trip to his hometown in Canada. Of course, that was after their romantic trip to Italy together when they first took their relationship public.\n\nThis week, Gomez has been hanging out with Tesfaye in New York where he was scheduled to perform. She seems to be enjoying her time in the city as she recently posted a series of photos documenting yet another date night look.\n\nThe \u201cBad Liar\u201d shared three images depicting her steamy date night outfit on Monday before she was spotted hand in hand with Abel. Her fans shared their thoughts on the sultry look as over 6 million people liked Selena\u2019s \u201cdate night\u201d post.\n\n\u201cYou are so beautiful and so is your dress.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BU-msH8ggkA/\n\nTMZ reported on Selena\u2019s \u201c silky date night \u201d with Abel as the couple was seen holding hands in Harlem.\n\n\u201cSelena Gomez and The Weeknd turned the streets of Harlem into their own runway show\u2026 flanked by bodyguards, of course.\u201d\n\nThe site detailed the couple\u2019s outfits as The Weeknd stuck to his causal attire while Gomez turned heads in her sleek silk gown.\n\n\u201cThe couple stepped out Monday night dressed to the nines \u2014 more so Selena, but Abel was rocking a sweet jacket too \u2014 as they did dinner at famed Italian restaurant RAO\u2019s.\u201d\n\nThe article reminded readers of the first time Selena and Abel were spotted together as they kissed near garbage bins outside a restaurant.
