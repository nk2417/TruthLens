Winners will be revealed in a ceremony at London's Festival Hall on Sunday, May 13 with \"The Great British Bakeoff\" presenter Sue Perkins hosting for the second year running. See the full list of BAFTA TV Awards nominations below and come back to Gold Derby for complete coverage of the ceremony.\n\nSEE 2018 BAFTA TV Awards full list of winners (and nominees too!) [UPDATING LIVE]\n\nThe historical drama \"The Crown,\" which chronicles the first years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, leads the BAFTA TV Awards nominations for the second year in a row with bids for Best Drama Series, Best Drama Actress (Claire Foy) and Best Drama Supporting Actress (Vanessa Kirby). Not surprisingly, this lavishly produced series, which screened on Netflix on both sides of the pond, won three of its seven races at last month's BAFTA TV craft awards honoring the best behind-the-scenes artists and professionals; these are equivalent to the Creative Arts Awards at the Emmys. (Read the full report on the BAFTA TV Craft Awards)\n\nWith its 10 episodes, \"The Crown\" easily crossed the threshold of six installments required to qualify as a drama series at these kudos; the cap is 19, after which a show is deemed to be a continuing drama. The catch-all drama acting categories pit the players in telefilms, miniseries and series against each other.\n\nAlso up for three awards at the main awards is another Netflix title, the anthology series \"Black Mirror.\" One of its installments, \"Hang the DJ,\" contends for Best Single Drama while its leading man Joe Cole is up for Best Actor. Jimmi Simpson is nominated for his supporting performance in \"USS Callister.\" The other Single Drama nominees are \" Against the Law,\" \"King Charles III\" and \"Murdered for Being Different.\"\n\nBEST DRAMA SERIES\n\n\"The Crown\"\n\n\"Line of Duty\"\n\n\"Peaky Blinders\"\n\n\"The End of the F***ing World\"\n\nBEST MINI-SERIES\n\n\"Howards End\"\n\n\"The Moorside\"\n\n\"The State\"\n\n\"Three Girls\"\n\nBEST SINGLE DRAMA\n\n\"Against the Law\"\n\n\"Black Mirror (Hang the DJ)\"\n\n\"King Charles III\"\n\n\"Murdered for Being Different\"\n\nBEST DRAMA ACTOR\n\nSean Bean, \"Broken\"\n\nJoe Cole, \"Black Mirror\"\n\nTim Pigott-Smith,\" King Charles III\"\n\nJack Rowan, \"Born to Kill\"\n\nBEST DRAMA ACTRESS\n\nClaire Foy, \"The Crown\"\n\nSinead Keenan, \"Little Boy Blue\"\n\nThandie Newton, \"Line of Duty\"\n\nMolly Windsor, \"Three Girls\"\n\nBEST DRAMA SUPPORTING ACTOR\n\nAdrian Dunbar, \"Line Of Duty\"\n\nAnupam Kher, \"The Boy with the Topknot\"\n\nBrian F.
