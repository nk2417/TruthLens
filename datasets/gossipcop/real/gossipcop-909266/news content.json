Fans of Friends should know that Lisa Kudrow has seen the trailer for the show\u2019s fake movie reboot.\n\n\u201cCourteney [Cox], actually, is the one who said, \u2018Did you see that trailer? What do we do?\u2019 Like, nothing, that\u2019s a clip!\u201d Kudrow, 54, joked on Thursday\u2019s Conan.\n\nWhen host Conan O\u2019Brien asked if Cox was confused by the clip, Kudrow replied, \u201cNo, she wasn\u2019t fooled. She was like, \u2018Wow, how did that go viral?\u2019 You know, autocorrect, \u2018How\u2019d that go biral?\u2019 But I knew what she meant.\u201d\n\nKudrow didn\u2019t seem overly impressed by the trailer, which to date has gotten more than 40 million views.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to make of it. It\u2019s just sort of these weird clips from things that clearly have nothing to do with Friends,\u201d she said.\n\nSo can fans hold out any hope for a Friends reunion or reboot?\n\n\u201cI mean, something should be done. I don\u2019t know what,\u201d Kudrow admitted. \u201cThey\u2019re rebooting everything. But I don\u2019t know -- how does that work with Friends though? That was about people in their 20s, 30s. The show isn\u2019t about people in their 40s, 50s, and if we have the same problems, that\u2019s just sad.\u201d\n\nKudrow played the beloved Phoebe Buffay on the hit sitcom for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004. Back in 2013, the actress shut down rumors of a Friends reunion on Conan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel enough already. I honestly just feel really bad just by saying, \u2018That was actually something that was never going to happen,\u2019\u201d Kudrow said.\n\nThe cast did get together for a group dinner last year, which Kudrow confirmed on the Today show.\n\n\u201cWe have convened,\u201d she said in February 2017. \u201cPrivately. For dinner.\u201d\n\nPrior to that admission the cast (minus Matthew Perry) reunited for a tribute to Friends director, James Burrows, in January 2016.\n\nFor more from the moment, watch the clip below!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nSadly, the \u2018Friends\u2019 Movie Trailer Is a Hoax -- But Watch It Anyway!\n\nJennifer Aniston Remembers Experiencing 'Friendship, Family and Heartbreak' With Her 'Friends' Co-Stars\n\nLisa Kudrow Reveals There Was a Secret 'Friends' Reunion: 'We Have Convened'", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/lisa_kudrow_youtube.jpg?h=2453b333&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/lisa_kudrow_youtube.jpg?h=2453b333", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2024-06/mk-WILLIAM-DANIELS%2C%20WILL-FRIEDLE-1920-x-800-GALLERY-HERO.jpg?h=2dd012a0&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/lisa_kudrow_youtube.jpg?h=2453b333", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/lisa-kudrow-reacts-fake-friends-movie-trailer-something-should-be-done-95113", "title": "Lisa Kudrow Reacts to Fake \u2018Friends\u2019 Movie Trailer: \u2018Something Should Be Done\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/lisa_kudrow_youtube.jpg?h=2453b333", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Kudrow opened up about the viral clip on Thursday\u2019s \u2018Conan.\u2019", "title": "Lisa Kudrow Reacts to Fake \u2018Friends\u2019 Movie Trailer: \u2018Something Should Be Done\u2019", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/lisa-kudrow-reacts-fake-friends-movie-trailer-something-should-be-done-95113", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Kudrow opened up about the viral clip on Thursday\u2019s \u2018Conan.\u2019", "twitter": {"description": "Kudrow opened up about the viral clip on Thursday\u2019s \u2018Conan.\u2019", "title": "Lisa Kudrow Reacts to Fake \u2018Friends\u2019 Movie Trailer: \u2018Something Should Be Done\u2019", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/lisa-kudrow-reacts-fake-friends-movie-trailer-something-should-be-done-95113", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/lisa_kudrow_youtube.jpg?h=2453b333", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Lisa Kudrow Reacts to Fake \u2018Friends\u2019 Movie Trailer: \u2018Something Should Be Done\u2019 | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, TV, Lisa Kudrow, Friends, Conan O Brien", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
