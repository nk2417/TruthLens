{"url": "https://people.com/tv/lena-waite-reflects-aziz-ansari-sexual-misconduct-allegation/", "text": "Lena Waithe has weighed in on the sexual misconduct allegation brought against her Master of None costar Aziz Ansari.\n\nWhen asked about the allegation in her April 2018 cover interview with Vanity Fair, the author writes that she became \u201cquieter, more thoughtful,\u201d before answering.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, what I would hope comes out of this is that we as a society \u2026 educate ourselves about what consent is \u2014 what it looks like, what it feels like, what it sounds like,\u201d she said. \u201cI think there are both men and women who are still trying to figure it out.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need to be more attuned to each other, pay more attention to each other, in every scenario, and really make sure that, whatever it is we\u2019re doing with someone else, they\u2019re comfortable doing whatever that thing is, and that we\u2019re doing it together,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s just human kindness and decency.\u201d\n\nIn January, an anonymous woman accused Ansari, 35, of sexual behavior that she classified as assault but he called consensual in a controversial article published on Babe.net that sparked a public conversation regarding the nuances of the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe woman, a 23-year-old Brooklyn photographer, recounted her allegations under the pseudonym \u201cGrace.\u201d She alleged that after meeting Ansari at an Emmy Awards afterparty in September 2017, they exchanged numbers and eventually went on a date, which she called \u201cthe worst of [her] life.\u201d After a meal, she said they returned to his apartment, where she alleged that Ansari behaved coercively and that several sexual acts occurred though she was \u201cphysically giving off cues that [she] wasn\u2019t interested.\u201d\n\nIn response, Ansari issued a statement acknowledging they went on a date and ended up engaging in sexual activity afterwards, which he said \u201cby all indications was completely consensual.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe next day, I got a text from her saying that although \u2018it may have seemed okay,\u2019 upon further reflection, she felt uncomfortable,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt was true that everything did seem okay to me, so when I heard that it was not the case for her, I was surprised and concerned. I took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said.\u201d\n\n\u201cI continue to support the movement that is happening in our culture,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is necessary and long overdue.\u201d\n\nWaithe, 33, previously touched on the Ansari allegation in an interview with KPCC\u2019s The Frame.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the truth \u2014 in every situation, it\u2019s not always black-and-white,\u201d she said last month. \u201cAnd I know that\u2019s simple for people, and it\u2019s easy for people to [ask], \u2018Whose side are you on?\u2019 There are no sides, really, in some of these scenarios.\u201d", "images":
