{"url": "https://www.gq.com/story/finesse-remix-bruno-mars-cardi-b", "text": "Somewhere along the way, Bruno Mars went from a lovable cornball with a fondness for fedoras to the greatest male performer in the world who now enjoys a wide variety of fun hats. (I would take a bullet for him.) Last night, Mars dropped a music video for the remix of \"Finesse,\" already one of the sleeper jams off 24K Magic, and made the wise decision to pay Cardi B a lot of money for a feature.\n\nAND HELLO IT IS A BOP:\n\nBruno Mars' decision to rebrand as a \"32 Things Only \u201990s Kids Will Remember\" BuzzFeed quiz is truly the greatest musical innovation the world has ever witnessed. It needs its own Harvard Business School case study. It's like getting sucked into a black hole and encountering the fun inverse of Justin Timberlake going full country in a parallel dimension.\n\nAnd the pairing with Bardi, whose true gift is having more fun than anyone else around her, hits all the feel-good throwback notes that make you nostalgic for a time when the threat of nuclear winter felt slightly less imminent. Let's hope Bruno Mars remixes his whole album and Cardi B is a guest on every single track.", "images": ["https://media.gq.com/photos/69177a6ad58ba7222e3de573/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6908d58d2616d5508f8011ff/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/68fbade849b0e624bbbdd257/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/69135aaefec3b1b423559910/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/68fa48124a759dc9bdb881eb/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/69027d8b371751b7eeb12aed/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4e5aab87d6663216962a02/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carbi-b-bruno-mars.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5d96247456b77e0009b6d92f/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/690bc157ab0916d9f53c4c0c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/asset-tentpole-moty.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/69039ee3d37b2b86690e83a8/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/691c9bf488e70c6290a4f1b7/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4e5aab87d6663216962a02/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/carbi-b-bruno-mars.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/68f7d2b959df5cbb81ffb026/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6901224d221ed6f4be11e0c6/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/691b8fcc9aef80814cc0b918/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4e5aab87d6663216962a02/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carbi-b-bruno-mars.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Gayomali"], "canonical_link": "https://www.gq.com/story/finesse-remix-bruno-mars-cardi-b", "title": "The \u201cFinesse\u201d Remix Is Proof That Bruno Mars Should Remake All His Songs with Cardi B", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Chris Gayomali", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "We have ourselves a bop!", "id": "5a4e4e7bf9c0471c02e7498c", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a4e4e7bf9c0471c02e7498c", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"We have ourselves a bop!\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4e5aab87d6663216962a02/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/carbi-b-bruno-mars.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4e5aab87d6663216962a02/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/carbi-b-bruno-mars.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "We have ourselves a bop!", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4e5aab87d6663216962a02/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carbi-b-bruno-mars.jpg", "site_name": "GQ", "title": "The \"Finesse\" Remix Is Proof That Bruno Mars Should Remake All His Songs with Cardi B", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gq.com/story/finesse-remix-bruno-mars-cardi-b"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-01-04T16:53:01.600Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-04T16:53:01.600Z", "author": "Chris Gayomali"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@gqmagazine", "description": "We have ourselves a bop!", "domain": "https://www.gq.com", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4e5aab87d6663216962a02/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carbi-b-bruno-mars.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@gqmagazine", "title": "The \"Finesse\" Remix Is Proof That Bruno Mars Should Remake All His Songs with Cardi B"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4e5aab87d6663216962a02/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/carbi-b-bruno-mars.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 606963029328755, "pages": 7962048097}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515084781.6, "source": "https://www.gq.com", "summary": ""}
