Deadline cleared up this noise Monday: Gadot was already committed to Wonder Woman 2, and Ratner\u2019s RatPac Dune isn\u2019t committed to co-finance the sequel.\n\nDuring an appearance today on Today to promote this weekend\u2019s release of Justice League, Savannah Guthrie asked whether she was making such demands, after Ratner had been accused by several women of sexual harassment in a Los Angeles Times report November 1.\n\nRatner subsequently said he was stepping back from Warner Bros; the studio moved fast to end its relationship with the producer-financier.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, a lot has been written about my views and the way that I feel, and everyone knows the way that I feel because I\u2019m not hiding anything,\u201d Gadot told Guthrie. \u201cBut the truth is, there\u2019s so many people involved in making this movie, and they all echo the same sentiments. Everyone knew what was the right thing to do. But there was nothing for me to actually come and say because it was already done before this article came out.\u201d\n\nJustice League opens Friday and is expected to rake in $325 million-$355 million globally in its first weekend at the box office.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nCheck out the interview above.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/today-gal-gadot.jpg?w=808"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/today-gal-gadot.jpg?w=808", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anthony D'Alessandro", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2017/11/gal-gadot-wonder-woman-2-brett-ratner-justice-league-1202208746/", "title": "Gal Gadot Clears Up Rumors About \u2018Wonder Woman 2\u2019 & Brett Ratner", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Gal Gadot responds to rumors she would not return for Wonder Woman 2 if producer-financier Brett Ratner was involved.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Anthony D'Alessandro", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Gal Gadot Clears Up Rumors About \u2018Wonder Woman 2\u2019 & Brett Ratner", "url": "https://deadline.com/2017/11/gal-gadot-wonder-woman-2-brett-ratner-justice-league-1202208746/", "description": "Gal Gadot responds to rumors she would not return for Wonder Woman 2 if producer-financier Brett Ratner was involved.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/today-gal-gadot.jpg?w=808", "width": 808, "height": 423, "alt": "Gal Gadot Today Show"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-15T16:34:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2024-12-19T00:24:53+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Gal Gadot responds to rumors she would not return for Wonder Woman 2 if producer-financier Brett Ratner was involved.", "site": "@Deadline", "creator": "@AwardsTony", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Gal Gadot Clears Up Rumors About \u2018Wonder Woman 2\u2019 & Brett Ratner", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/today-gal-gadot.jpg?w=808"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510763658.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
