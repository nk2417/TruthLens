We\u2019re really into each other,\u201d he shared, adding that given the depth of their feelings for one another, all of their Instagram photos together are only natural.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be posts with each other because we enjoy each other\u2019s company a lot,\u201d he remarked. \u201cWe\u2019re really attracted to one another.\u201d\n\nShedding light on how the couple likes to spend their time, Rodgers shared that the pair both \u201creally enjoy traveling.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s up for anything travel-wise, which is fun,\u201d he told Artful Living, adding that \u201cshe\u2019s a good travel partner because she\u2019s so laid-back and low-maintenance.\u201d\n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t hurt that she has a trick or two up her sleeve when it comes to the kitchen\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a hell of a cook, so we love just staying in, too,\u201d he told the outlet. \u201cShe eats really healthy. She\u2019s inspired me in that way.\u201d\n\nAlberto E. Rodriguez/Getty\n\nMichael Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe pair made their red carpet debut at the 2018 ESPY Awards in July, where Patrick also made history, becoming the first woman to ever host the event.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really proud of her for that,\u201d Rogers told Artful Living, before praising Patrick for being the most successful female driver in the history of American open-wheel racing.\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t many women who race. None who ever won an Indy race and none with as many top-10 finishes as her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s a strong woman, and she went through a lot in her career. I\u2019m proud of the way that she ended [her career] and I\u2019m proud of her doing the ESPYs.\u201d\n\nPatrick retired from racing in May.\n\nReinhold Matay/AP/REX/Shutterstock\n\nOpening up about the origins of their love story, Patrick revealed earlier this year that although the pair met in 2012 \u2014 and exchanged email addresses \u2014 it took years before their relationship became romantic.\n\n\u201cWe kept in touch a little bit, and there were some years we didn\u2019t talk to each other, and then some every now and again, but it wasn\u2019t until obviously recently that we actually had phone numbers,\u201d Patrick, a longtime fan of Packers rivals, the Chicago Bears, recalled while appearing on Jenny McCarthy\u2019s SiriusXM in May. \u201cWe referred to each other as Chicago and Green Bay \u2014 it was very cute.\u201d\n\nRodgers, who helped to lead the Packers to victory in the 2010 Super Bowl, ended his relationship with Olivia Munn in 2017 after three years together. Patrick was previously dating NASCAR driver Ricky Stenhouse Jr. before their split in 2017.", "images":
