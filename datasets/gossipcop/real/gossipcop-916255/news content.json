Lovato also shared photos of the twosome with their arms wrapped around one another in June 2017 during a barbecue she hosted at her L.A. estate.\n\nRelated: Check Out Hollywood\u2019s Friendliest Exes See how Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake and many more A-listers remain pals post-breakup\n\nThe Sonny With a Chance actress opened up about the duo\u2019s heart-wrenching split in her October 2017 documentary Simply Complicated. \u201cI\u2019ve never loved anybody like I\u2019ve loved Wilmer. And I still love Wilmer,\u201d she revealed. \u201cWhen I met him and I laid eyes on him for the first time, I was in hair and makeup and I was like, \u2018I love his man and I have to have him.\u2019 But I was only 17 so he was like, \u2018Get away from me.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdded the \u201cConfident\u201d songstress: \u201cAfter I turned 18, we began dating and I think it was love at first sight. I don\u2019t really believe in that, but I believe it happened. We connected on a level that I\u2019ve never connected with anybody before. He was just my rock, my everything.\u201d\n\nThe Grammy nominee also noted in her movie that the breakup \u201chad nothing to do with falling out of love. We decided together that that we\u2019re probably better as friends.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
