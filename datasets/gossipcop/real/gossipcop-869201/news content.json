{"url": "https://people.com/celebrity/amber-rose-defends-blac-chyna-rob-kardashian-relationship/", "text": "Three weeks after Rob Kardashian\u2018s explosive social media rampage against his ex-fianc\u00e9e Blac Chyna, Amber Rose has weighed in on the controversy.\n\nOn Tuesday\u2019s episode of Complex\u2019s Everyday Struggle, Rose, 33, who is best friends with Chyna, 29, addressed the roller coaster relationship between the two stars \u2014 and refuted allegations that Chyna only dated Kardashian, 30, for money and fame.\n\n\u201cI taught Chyna a lot about feminism, and now she\u2019s living it \u2014 she\u2019s living out all the bulls\u2014, basically,\u201d said Rose, noting that revenge porn is \u201cvery much a thing.\u201d\n\nIn his July 5 tirade, Kardashian took to Instagram and Twitter to repeatedly share graphic and expletive-ridden content about his ex \u2014 including three naked photos \u2014 while accusing her of drug use, alcohol abuse and infidelity. Chyna and her legal team accused him of violating California\u2019s revenge porn laws, and a judge has since granted her a set of restraining orders against Kardashian. The two are scheduled to return to court on Aug. 8.\n\n\u201cPeople look at the media and just be like: \u2018She\u2019s like this\u2019 \u2014 but Chyna is an amazing mom, she\u2019s an amazing person, and she\u2019s extremely loving,\u201d said Rose. \u201cI was around when her and Rob first met. I\u2019ll tell you firsthand that they very much loved each other. It was very real.\u201d\n\nGiven Chyna\u2019s complicated history with Kardashian\u2019s famous family \u2014 she shares a 4-year-old son with Kardashian\u2019s sister Kylie Jenner\u2018s former boyfriend Tyga \u2014 news of her relationship with Kardashian, which began in January 2016, launched an onslaught of speculation about the nature of the romance.\n\nThe two welcomed daughter Dream Ren\u00e9e last November, and in his recent Twitter spree, Kardashian accused Chyna of having a baby with him \u201cout of spite.\u201d But according to Rose, both Chyna and Kardashian genuinely wanted to have a child together.\n\n\u201cThey both wanted to have Dream,\u201d said Rose. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a mistake, it wasn\u2019t an \u2018entrapment,\u2019 it wasn\u2019t anything like that. I remember when her and Rob met, how they fell in love and how happy they were. They\u2019re just not happy anymore. That\u2019s life. It just happens.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt just goes back to people being uncomfortable with women making their own decisions in life,\u201d she continued. \u201cChyna was with Rob, she had a baby with him, they both wanted Dream, [who] is a beautiful baby. S\u2014 didn\u2019t work out and she opted to leave. She did not want to be in that situation anymore, and that made people uncomfortable.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople look at Chyna like: \u2018She got Rob for everything, she\u2019s taking his money,\u2019 \u201d she added. \u201cShe\u2019s not that type of person, and neither am I. We\u2019re not out trying to finesse motherf\u2014ers. We have our own money. People fail to realize we got money, we got cars \u2026 we\u2019re straight.\u201d\n\nOf Kardashian\u2019s social media attack, Rose said it was \u201csome sucker ass s\u2014.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t do that,\u201d she said. \u201cI understand [he was hurt]. But how about she\u2019s hurt as well?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, I can speak for my friend Chyna \u2014 I know what they really had, I was there,\u201d she continued. \u201cIf you\u2019re not happy in a relationship, you\u2019re going to be out. Rob should have been a mature adult and had a conversation with Chyna and been like, \u2018You know what Chyna, I\u2019m very frustrated, I feel like you used me.\u2019 And she could have then said, \u2018You know what? I didn\u2019t, I actually cared about you, but I\u2019m not trying to be in this situation with you anymore.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t have to go on the internet and be petty, and now he\u2019s dealing with revenge porn,\u201d she added. \u201cYou can\u2019t do s\u2014 like that. It\u2019s time to grow up and handle your business properly. You have a kid that\u2019s going to forever see that s\u2014.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Blac Chyna Reveals The Shocking Moment Rob Kardashian Uploaded Her Most Intimate Photos Online\n\nIn an exclusive sit-down with PEOPLE earlier this month, Chyna slammed critics questioning the sincerity of her relationship with Kardashian, speculating that she was just out for his money.\n\n\u201cI make my own money \u2014 I\u2019ve been making my own money for a very, very long time,\u201d she said. \u201cMy first job was at McDonald\u2019s when I was 15. Years later, right after I had King, I wanted to do something that expressed myself, so I started Lashed Cosmetics. The lipsticks, the full skincare line, the beauty bar and 88Fin clothing trickled down from that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody supports me at all,\u201d she added. \u201cIf anything, I\u2019ve gotten other people more money \u2026 I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d", "images":
