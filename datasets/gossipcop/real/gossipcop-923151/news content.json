In hopes of sliding her a Heineken, he floats over the beverage, while having it pass by a Black woman and an older Black man. When the drink finally arrives in the desired woman\u2019s hands, the campaign\u2019s tagline, \u201cSometimes, lighter is better\u201d pops up at the conclusion of the commercial.\n\nLater, Chance chimed back in on his previous comments and said that he wasn\u2019t urging people to \u201cboycott,\u201d but instead, was pointing out the numerous times controversial ads were spearheaded by racist comments.\n\n\u201cIm not saying boycott them or go off im just noticing how often it happens and I think they baiting consumers and tweeters and freelancers and shit. Like I didnt wanna tweet about it so bad but its like how can u not.\u201d\n\nCheck out the commercial and Chance\u2019s tweeted comments below.\n\nI think some companies are purposely putting out noticably racist ads so they can get more views.
