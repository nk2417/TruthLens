Don\u2019t worry, we have dramas, comedies, action series, and sci-fi shows on every platform from Netflix to HBO Go.\n\nPhoto credit: Netflix Show: \u201cBodyguard\u201d Net: Netfix \u2014 The first six episodes of this UK import crossed the pond earlier this month, and you can definitely get through them all quickly. Though we do recommend a few breaks.\n\nPhoto credit: Netflix Show: \u201cChilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d Net: Netflix \u2014 Season 1 of Netflix\u2019s TV adaptation of the Archie Comics character is the show you want if you are looking for a few witchy tricks after all your Thanksgiving treats.\n\nPhoto credit: Amazon Show: \u201cMarvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d Net: Amazon Prime Video \u2014 You can binge through the first season of this Emmy winner while you await the second season drop on Dec. 5.\n\nPhoto credit: Netflix Show: \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d Sixth and Final Season Net: Netflix \u2014 This is your last hoorah with Claire Underwood, so you decide if you wanna gobble up the episodes all at once.\n\nPhoto credit: Netflix Show: \u201cInsatiable\u201d Net: Netflix \u2014 We could make a binge joke here, but that\u2019s probably inappropriate. But if you are into the kind of dark humor this show has, you probably already thought of one yourself.\n\nPhoto credit: FX Show: \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Apocalypse\u201d Net: FX \u2014 The entire 10-episode season will have wrapped by the time you are done with your turkey, so if you wanna wait to dive into this end-of-days tale then we won\u2019t stop you.\n\nPhoto credit: FX Show: \u201cPose\u201d Net: FX \u2014 Ryan Murphy\u2019s latest FX series was one of the breakout hits of the 2017-18 season. Enjoy the throwback to NYC ballroom culture while you are lounging and lazy.\n\nPhoto credit: CBS Studios Show: \u201cSabrina the Teenage Witch\u201d Net: Hulu \u2014 The entire seven-season run of this former TGIF staple is available for binge-watching on Hulu. So if you finish up Netflix\u2019s new adaptation and want a lighter take, you got it.\n\nPhoto credit: Fox Show: \u201c9-1-1\u201d Net: Fox \u2014 This crazy drama\u2019s second year is already underway, but the first season was short enough we bet you can binge all the episodes in a day or two.\n\nPhoto credit: HBO Show: \u201cInsecure\u201d Net: HBO \u2014 Three seasons worth of Issa Rae\u2019s antics are ready for your viewing pleasure on HBO Go.\n\nPhoto credit: AMC Show: \u201cDietland\u201d Net: AMC \u2014 This Marti Noxon series was canceled by the cable network after just one season, but you can enjoy that one season now.\n\nPhoto credit: HBO Show: \u201cSharp Objects\u201d Net: HBO \u2014 This limited series is Noxon\u2019s other big project of the year \u2014 but the TV adaptation of Gillian Flynn\u2019s debut novel was always intended to be just eight episodes. And that means you can get through the full story with a few days off.\n\nPhoto credit: Amazon Show: \u201cPatriot\u201d Net: Amazon Prime Video \u2014 Seasons 1 and 2 now available, if you are into a dark comedic take on the spy thriller genre.\n\nPhoto credit: FX Show: \u201cAtlanta\u201d Net: FX \u2014 We don\u2019t know when Donald Glover\u2019s surrealist comedy will return, but for now you can enjoy the first two installments of the FX series on Hulu.\n\nPhoto credit: Starz Show: \u201cSweetbitter\u201d Net: Starz \u2014 If you want more gastronomic-centric drama while you digest the meal you just ate with your dramatic family.\n\nPhoto credit: Starz Show: \u201cVida\u201d Net: Starz \u2014 \u201cVida\u201d got a second season pickup from the subscription cable channel, so you can enjoy your Season 1 binge, knowing there is more to eat up ahead.\n\nPhoto credit: HBO Show: \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d Season 7 Net: HBO \u2014 We don\u2019t have a premiere date for the eighth and final season of David Benioff and D.B. Weiss\u2019 HBO epic, but we know it\u2019s coming in the first half of 2019. So why not revisit last season\u2019s batch of episodes now?\n\nPhoto credit: The CW Show: \u201cBlack Lightning\u201d Net: The CW \u2014 One of the latest additions to the younger-skewing network\u2019s superhero lineup, the second season of \u201cBlack Lightning\u201d has just begun. If you want to dive into the heroic tale, this is a great use of your downtime.\n\nPhoto credit: Hulu Show: \u201cHandmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d Net: Hulu \u2014 Seasons 1 and 2 of Bruce Miller\u2019s TV adaptation of Margaret Atwood\u2019s dystopian story are ready for your streaming pleasure. They are shorter seasons than a broadcast drama \u2014 but they will take a few days to get through, seeing as you\u2019ll need a few long breaks to digest the disturbing content.\n\nPhoto credit: Hulu Show: \u201cThe First\u201d Net: Hulu \u2014 Sean Penn as an astronaut? Yes, you are definitely here for a weekend of that.\n\nPhoto credit: Netflix Show: \u201cThe Haunting of Hill House\u201d Net: Netflix \u2014 The 10-episode story of the Crain family will have you crying and screaming for hours on end. RIP Bent-Neck Lady.\n\nPhoto credit: HBO Show: \u201cThe Deuce\u201d Net: HBO \u2014 The first 2 seasons of this James Franco-led drama about the sex-trade industry in the heart of New York\u2019s Times Square in the 1970s are worth at least 2 days of your time.\n\nPhoto credit: Hulu Show: \u201cCastle Rock\u201d Net: Hulu \u2014 This haunting series set in the Stephen King universe combines many a story into a very unique first season. You should probably watch it during the day though. Or, you know, with a large group of people you can split some pie with, so it doesn\u2019t get too scary.\n\nPhoto credit: Hulu Show: \u201cLight as a Feather\u201d Net: Hulu \u2014 This teen drama is sure to help wipe away your own problems and make you worry about theirs \u2014 at least for the holiday weekend.\n\nPhoto credit: Warner Bros Show: \u201cFriends,\u201d all the Thanksgiving episodes Net: Netflix \u2014 Yes, you\u2019ve seen them. But what better time to enjoy some of the best Thanksgiving episodes in sitcom history than Turkey Day?\n\nPhoto credit: Netflix Show: \u201cStranger Things\u201d Net: Netflix \u2014 The third season of the Duffer Bros \u201980s-set sci-fi series won\u2019t be back until (probably) summer 2019. So you do have a while if you aren\u2019t all caught up yet. But there is no time like the present to enjoy a blast from the past.\n\nPhoto credit: AMC Show: \u201cThe Terror\u201d Net: AMC \u2014 This drama from Ridley Scott is AMC\u2019s first anthology series, coming back with a brand new tale next year. And though the first season is supposed to be completely independent from the next, the story of a British Royal Navy expedition that went horribly, horribly wrong is worth the binge.", "images":
