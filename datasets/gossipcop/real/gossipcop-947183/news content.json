{"url": "https://www.indiewire.com/2018/04/2018-new-indie-movies-summer-releases-1201951208/", "text": "This week, IndieWire will be rolling out our annual Summer Preview, including offerings that span genres, niche offerings for dedicated fans, a closer look at festival favorites finally headed to a theater near you, and plenty of special attention to all the new movies you need to get through a jam-packed summer movie-going season. Check back throughout the week for a new look at the best the season has to offer, and clear your schedule, because we\u2019re going to fill it right up.\n\nRead More: Check out our entire Summer Preview right here\n\nToday \u2014 29 indie standouts and festival favorites (including exciting new offerings from some of our favorite directors, from Jason Reitman to Debra Granik, Spike Lee to Gus Van Sant, Paul Schrader to Desiree Akhavan, and plenty of rising stars) bound for a big screen near you.\n\n\u201cTully,\u201d May 4\n\nA very different kind of adult fairy tale (one that frequently doubles as a feature-length advertisement for tubal ligation), \u201cTully\u201d is a fantasy of the highest order; it might look like an episode of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d but this story is every bit as magical as \u201cThe Shape of Water.\u201d Think of it as Diablo Cody\u2019s modern take on \u201cMary Poppins\u201d: What it lacks in musical sequences, it more than makes up for in sex scenes and Carly Rae Jepsen sing-alongs. Starring a convincingly worn-out Charlize Theron as a 40-year-old mother of two, \u201cTully\u201d tells the story of a woman who\u2019s at her wit\u2019s end before a luminous young night nurse (Mackenzie Davis) rings her doorbell and restores her to life. Funnier than \u201cJuno\u201d and almost as ruthlessly honest as \u201cYoung Adult,\u201d Cody\u2019s third collaboration with director Jason Reitman is a razor-sharp movie about the trials of motherhood, and the clear and present danger of losing yourself once you start living for someone else. \u2014DE\n\n\u201cRBG,\u201d May 4\n\nWhen she was growing up, Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s beloved mother Celia gave her two lessons to guide her through life: \u201cBe a lady\u201d and \u201cBe independent.\u201d That two-pronged approach appears to have influenced every aspect of the Supreme Court justice\u2019s life, both personal and political. In Betsy West and Julie Cohen\u2019s wide-ranging \u201cRBG,\u201d Ginsburg\u2019s life \u2014 and its many lessons, both learned and taught \u2014 come to entertaining and energetic life. It\u2019s a fist-pumping, crowd-pleasing documentary that makes one heck of a play to remind people of Ginsburg\u2019s vitality and importance, now more than ever. \u201cRBG\u201d serves as a compelling Ginsburg primer, and West and Cohen are understandably interested in driving home just how fully she fought back sexism at every stage of her professional life, from her experience at Harvard Law to her first steps into full-time work to her Supreme Court appointment. Yet it\u2019s the insights into her personal life that feel the most vital, moving \u201cRBG\u201d beyond the kind of information you could read on a Wikipedia page (as ably and entertainingly rendered as they may be on the big screen). -KE\n\n\u201cRevenge,\u201d May 11\n\nIf you love New French Extremity films like \u201cHigh Tension\u201d and \u201cMartyrs,\u201d and have been yearning for a grisly, blood-soaked heroine, have we got the film for you. \u201cRevenge\u201d stars Matilda Anna Ingrid Lutz, who transforms from sex kitten to badass on a mission to seek revenge against the men who wronged her. Jen (Lutz) is taken on a getaway by her lover, a married man, but is surprised when two of his friends also show up on the trip. The men have sinister intentions, but Jen isn\u2019t going down without a fight and the guys have a big surprise waiting for them, as Jen morphs into a defiant Final Girl for the ages. Bloody, brutal, and unforgettable, \u201cRevenge\u201d is a great way to kick off the summer horror season. \u2014JR\n\n\u201cBeast,\u201d May 11\n\nA stylish romantic noir, \u201cBeast\u201d debuted at TIFF last year and breaks out two well-matched UK actors, \u201cTaboo\u201d star Jessie Buckley and \u201cLovesick\u201d regular Johnny Flynn. Rookie director Michael Pearce balances gorgeous scenery with two mysterious and charismatic yet unreliable characters who draw us into their love affair but are capable of\u2026what, exactly? We are afraid to find out, and you should be, too. You\u2019ll hear more from Pearce very soon, who\u2019s been doing the LA meeting rounds. -AT\n\n\u201cThe Day After,\u201d May 11\n\nSouth Korean favorite Hong Sang-soo has been unstoppable as of late. \u201cThe Day After\u201d will be the director\u2019s third in the U.S. in the last year alone, following \u201cOn the Beach Alone at Night\u201d and \u201cClaire\u2019s Camera.\u201d Hong\u2019s latest premiered at Cannes last year and stars his recent muse and \u201cThe Handmaiden\u201d star Kim Min-hee. The story, shot in black and white, centers on a dramatic love triangle between a man, his wife, and the unassuming woman his wife mistakes for being romantically involved with her husband. -ZS\n\n\u201cFilmworker,\u201d May 11\n\nAn absolute must-see documentary for fans of Stanley Kubrick, Tony Zierra\u2019s \u201cFilmworker\u201d brings us into the life of the legendary and mysterious director\u2019s long-time assistant Leon Vitali. Kubrick was both notoriously private and insistent on working with a tight-knit group of confidants and, for over two decades Vitali \u2013 who first worked with Kubrick as an actor in \u201cBarry Lyndon\u201d (1975) \u2013 was one of those who dedicated his life to serving the great master\u2019s vision. Not only does \u201cFilmworker\u201d give cinephiles an unique view inside this closed-door world of Kubrick\u2019s process, it paints a fascinating portrait of those lesser-known collaborators who enable such an obsessive artist \u2013 something that becomes particularly emotional resonant in the role Vitali played ushering \u201cEyes Wide Shut\u201d to the finish line after Kubrick died in 1999. -CO\n\n\u201cFirst Reformed,\u201d May 18\n\nFor 40 years, Paul Schrader has made movies about serious, driven men isolated by deep-seated philosophical conflicts. From \u201cAmerican Gigolo\u201d to \u201cMishima: A Life in Four Chapters\u201d to \u201cAffliction\u201d \u2014 not to mention the \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d screenplay for which he\u2019s best known \u2014 Schrader\u2019s stone-faced protagonists are guided by a spiritual sense of purpose that reflects his Calvinist upbringing. With \u201cFirst Reformed,\u201d that obsession takes center stage in an absorbing late period achievement that brings Schrader\u2019s talent back into focus. \u201cFirst Reformed\u201d consolidates the decades of bubbling guilt and frustration experienced by so many Schrader protagonists into a single enraged priest, played with brilliant layers of guilt and discontent by Ethan Hawke. Hawke\u2019s character wrestles with an ecological crisis, his own faith, and his allegiance to his church in a suspenseful pileup of circumstances that keeps you guessing all the way through the shocking finale. It\u2019s the best work in years for both men, a fascinating meditation on inner turmoil in which doing the right thing can lead down many wrong directions. \u2013EK\n\n\u201cPope Francis \u2013 A Man of His Word,\u201d May 18\n\nWim Wenders\u2019 latest documentary, \u201cPope Francis \u2013 A Man of His Word,\u201d will make its global debut at Cannes, but without the Pope. After producer Alessandro Lo Monaco worked closely with the Vatican on Gianfranco Pannone\u2019s documentary about the Vatican\u2019s Swiss Guard, the Vatican approached him about co-producing a documentary about outspoken Pope Francis, who seeks to communicate directly with the people. Lo Monaco turned to three-time Oscar nominee Wenders (documentaries \u201cBuena Vista Social Club,\u201d \u201cPina,\u201d and \u201cSalt of the Earth\u201d), who devised a direct-to-camera visual and narrative concept to engage the audience face-to-face with the pope, creating a dialogue between him and a cross-section of humanity as he responds to questions from farmers, workers, refugees, children, the elderly, prison inmates, and those who live in favelas and migrant camps. Intended as a personal journey with the Pope rather than a biography, the movie films Pope Francis addressing his audience on the big subjects: life, death, social justice, immigration, ecology, wealth inequality, materialism, and the role of the family. -AT\n\n\u201cHow to Talk to Girls at Parties,\u201d May 25 John Cameron Mitchell\u2019s \u201cHow To Talk to Girls at Parties\u201d premiered at the Cannes Film Festival last year and is finally coming to theaters this summer, thanks to A24. The film is adapted from the short story by Neil Gaiman and is kind of like a punk rock version of \u201cUnder the Skin.\u201d Elle Fanning plays an alien who falls in love with humanity after befriending an English teenager obsessed with the punk scene. With its outlandish costumes and edgy storyline, the film finds Mitchell back in \u201cHedwig\u201d mode following his dramatic last feature, \u201cRabbit Hole.\u201d There\u2019s also Nicole Kidman as an alien leader, so you know you can\u2019t miss it. -ZS\n\n\u201cAmerican Animals,\u201d June 1\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen too many movies.\u201d It\u2019s a line that\u2019s almost as old as the movies themselves. And yet, in reality, very few people have actually seen too many movies. More often, the trouble is that someone hasn\u2019t seen enough movies \u2014 or, in the case of Bart Layton\u2019s \u201cAmerican Animals,\u201d that they\u2019ve seen just enough movies to get them into trouble. A slick, well-acted, and intensely self-reflexive docudrama from the director of \u201cThe Impostor,\u201d \u201cAmerican Animals\u201d stars Barry Keoghan and Evan Peters in the true story of some bored young film buffs who hatch a plan that\u2019s too good to be true: They\u2019re going to break into the special-collection section of the Transylvania University Library \u2014 home to some of the world\u2019s rarest books \u2014 and steal millions of dollars worth of classic literature. You\u2019ll be shocked to learn that things don\u2019t go according to plan. A fun heist thriller with a seriously meta twist, \u201cAmerican Animals\u201d is fiercely entertaining from start to finish, even when its characters are acting so dumb that you start to suspect they still have some more evolving to do. \u2014DE\n\n\u201cHereditary,\u201d June 8\n\nA24 has been at the forefront of some of the best indie horror releases in past years thanks to \u201cThe Witch\u201d and \u201cIt Comes at Night,\u201d and \u201cHereditary\u201d looks to continue that tradition. After taking Sundance by storm earlier this year, \u201cHereditary\u201d seems poised to conquer the summer horror box office, and rival \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d as one of the year\u2019s best horror movies. After the death of her mother, Annie (Toni Collette) and her family discover dark secrets about their ancestry, but they soon discover you cannot outrun the things you have inherited, especially when they are sinister. Filled with chilling images (seriously, that man on fire!), a powerhouse performance by Collette, and one eerie little girl, \u201cHereditary\u201d is sure to terrifying audiences, and be an unforgettable experience at the movies this summer. \u2014JR\n\n\u201cHearts Beat Loud,\u201d June 8\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine being embarrassed to have Nick Offerman as your dad, but by sheer force of effortless charm, Kiersey Clemons (\u201cDope\u201d) makes it look natural. From three-time Sundance alum Brett Haley (\u201cThe Hero,\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll See You in My Dreams\u201d), \u201cHearts Beat Loud\u201d stars Offerman as a father who convinces his daughter into starting a band with him. Saddled with a struggling record shop, he pressures her to take a year off before college after their song receives minor attention on Spotify. The film was critically well-received out of Sundance, with many praising the heartwarming story and singling out Clemons\u2019 performance. Toni Collette, Blythe Danner, and Ted Danson also star, with an original music by Keegan DeWitt. The film also boasts a tender teen romance between Clemons and Sasha Lane (\u201cAmerican Honey\u201d), which is sure to interest anyone with an eye on the rising indie stars. -JD\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t You Be My Neighbor?,\u201d June 8\n\n\u201cWhen I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, \u2018Look for the helpers,\u2019\u201d wrote beloved children\u2019s television host Fred Rogers in one of his 36 books. \u201c\u2018You will always find people who are helping.\u2019\u201d Rogers died in 2003, leaving an imprint on the entire galaxy (an asteroid was named in his honor). Yet these words have been recirculated often in the intervening years, when the nation Rogers wished good morning for more than three decades awakes to another mass shooting or act of terrorism. And there\u2019s more to come: a Tom Hanks-led biopic called \u201cYou Are My Friend\u201d will follow this documentary from Oscar recipient and recent Cannes casualty Morgan Neville (\u201c20 Feet from Stardom\u201d). An ordained minister whose red cardigan now resides in the Smithsonian, Rogers harkens back to a simpler, gentler-seeming time \u2013 numerous audience members were overheard weeping during the tribute\u2019s Sundance Film Festival premiere. Yet he confronted societal injustices everyday on his Emmy-winning \u201cMister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood\u201d \u2013 where Michael Keaton was once a stagehand \u2013 phrasing lessons with great care that was never patronizing, even when conveyed a miniature trolley-ride away, by the puppet nobility of The Neighborhood of Make-Believe. -JM\n\nCheck out more summer preview picks on the next
