Judge James Burke reminds them that to convict, they must be sure of the defendant's guilt beyond all reasonable doubt and must reach unanimous verdicts on each count. If they cannot, the judge may be forced to declare a mistrial.\n\nJudge Burke warns lead defence lawyer Donna Rotunno not to talk to the press after an opinion piece she wrote for Newsweek drew the ire of prosecutors.\n\n24 February 2020\n\nAfter five days of deliberation, the jury finds Weinstein guilty of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and third-degree rape.\n\nThe 67-year-old is convicted of sexually assaulting former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006 and raping ex-actress Jessica Mann in 2013.\n\nHe is acquitted of first-degree rape and two counts of predatory sexual assault, charges that could have seen him jailed for life.\n\nThough cleared of the most serious charges made against him, the producer still faces up to 25 years in prison on the sexual assault conviction.\n\n11 March 2020\n\nWeinstein is sentenced to 23 years in prison for rape and sexual assault.\n\nThe 67-year-old appeared in court on Wednesday in a wheelchair.\n\nHis lawyers had appealed for leniency, saying even the minimum sentence of five years could be a \"life sentence\" but prosecutors argued Weinstein should be given the maximum possible sentence, given his \"lifetime of abuse\" towards women and \"lack of remorse\" for his actions.\n\n29 May 2020\n\nWeinstein is accused of sexual assault by four further women as he serves a 23-year prison sentence.\n\nCourt documents filed in New York on Thursday allege several sexual offences dating from 1984 to 2013.\n\nOne of the four anonymous women was 17 at the time of an alleged attack.\n\nWeinstein's legal representative told BBC News: \"Mr Weinstein intends to defend against the claims filed anonymously against him yesterday.\"\n\n5 April 2021\n\nWeinstein's lawyers launch an appeal against his conviction, arguing the judge made errors that denied his right to a fair trial.\n\nIn a 166-page brief they raise seven examples of alleged errors and say the judge disregarded \"fundamental principles of New York law and violated Mr Weinstein's constitutional rights\".\n\n15 June 2021\n\nA New York judge ruled Weinstein can be extradited to California to face additional sexual assault charges.\n\nWeinstein's defence team had argued that he should remain in New York to receive appropriate medical care.\n\n21 July 2021\n\nWeinstein pleaded not guilty to rape and sexual assault charges in a Los Angeles court.\n\nHe appeared in court in a wheelchair after being extradited from New York, where he is serving a 23-year jail sentence for similar crimes.\n\n2 June 2022\n\nA New York appellate court upheld Weinstein's rape conviction, rejecting his claims that the judge had prejudiced him by allowing women to testify about allegations that were not part of the criminal case.\n\n8 June 2022\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) authorised the Metropolitan Police to charge Weinstein with two counts of indecent assault against a woman in London in the summer of 1996.\n\nIt came after a review of evidence gathered by the force. It is alleged two offences took place in London between 31 July and 31 August 1996.\n\n25 October 2022\n\nWeinstein goes on trial in LA, facing 11 charges involving five alleged victims.\n\n20 December 2022\n\nWeinstein is found guilty by a Los Angeles jury of raping a woman.\n\nThe two-month trial heard how Weinstein used his influence to lure women into private meetings before attacking them.\n\nThe 70-year-old Oscar winner faces up to 24 years in prison when he is sentenced.\n\n23 February 2023\n\nWeinstein is sentenced to 16 years in prison for the 2013 rape of an actress in Los Angeles.\n\nHe begged for leniency in a Los Angeles court moments before he was sentenced, saying he did not \"deserve\" life in prison.\n\nThe anonymous victim told the court before the sentencing about the trauma she had endured for \"many years\" since the assault.", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/f088/live/a99682b0-c534-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F4A8/production/_128723626_4510ee762080b4c4034b76be218b4c1f5462a0800_227_7499_42191000x563.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/E892/production/_98283595_white_line.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3B77/production/_127932251_4510ee762080b4c4034b76be218b4c1f5462a0800_227_7499_42191000x563.jpg.webp", "https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ADF0/production/_106282544_2b69d5aa-9c36-475a-914c-5e79c202dfde.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/4f47/live/3e711df0-c44a-11f0-aa07-8f78e8344346.png.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/69ae/live/c2f94220-c556-11f0-a1c2-758f53fd6195.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7fd8/live/b9f20350-c462-11f0-8a46-59224c61e7f0.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/dfc5/live/b49ef750-c539-11f0-88be-3bc2aea1a256.jpg.webp"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F4A8/production/_128723626_4510ee762080b4c4034b76be218b4c1f5462a0800_227_7499_42191000x563.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41594672", "title": "Harvey Weinstein timeline: How the scandal has unfolded", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "page.section": "Culture", "page.subsection": "Entertainment_and_arts", "og": {"title": "Harvey Weinstein timeline: How the scandal has unfolded", "description": "Key moments in the cases against the producer, who has been found guilty of rape and sexual assault.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F4A8/production/_128723626_4510ee762080b4c4034b76be218b4c1f5462a0800_227_7499_42191000x563.jpg", "alt": "Image shows Harvey Weinstein at his LA trial"}}, "twitter": {"title": "Harvey Weinstein timeline: How the scandal has unfolded", "description": "Key moments in the cases against the producer, who has been found guilty of rape and sexual assault.", "image": {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/F4A8/production/_128723626_4510ee762080b4c4034b76be218b4c1f5462a0800_227_7499_42191000x563.jpg", "alt": "Image shows Harvey Weinstein at his LA trial"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Key moments in the cases against the producer, who has been found guilty of rape and sexual assault.", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364147881, app-argument=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41594672", "version": "web-2.33.2-3", "al": {"ios": {"url": "bbcx://news/entertainment-arts-41594672", "app_store_id": 364147881, "app_name": "BBC: World News & Stories"}, "android": {"url": "bbcx://news/entertainment-arts-41594672", "app_name": "BBC: World News & Stories", "package": "bbc.mobile.news.ww"}, "web": {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41594672"}}, "cXenseParse": {"pageclass": "article", "publishtime": "2017-10-12T13:58:44.000Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2023-02-24T09:29:30.000Z"}, "next-head-count": 41}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.bbc.com", "summary": ""}
