However, her father, Richard Williams, was not by her side.\n\nThe tennis star revealed in the third episode of the HBO documentary Being Serena that Richard told her via text just one hour before the ceremony that he didn\u2019t feel able to escort her on her wedding day.\n\n\u201cHe was in New Orleans, he had a suit, and I know he was really excited,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut then he wrote me and said: \u2018Serena, I don\u2019t want you to be mad at me, but I just can\u2019t walk you down the aisle. I\u2019m not myself anymore. I\u2019m just too nervous.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSerena reacted with complete understanding, writing back, \u201cDaddy, it\u2019s okay, if you don\u2019t want to come to the wedding at all, that\u2019s okay too. I\u2019m not going to be upset with you about it, so I don\u2019t want you to be upset about it.\u201d\n\nThe 36-year-old athlete \u2014 who welcomed daughter Alexis Olympia just two months before tying the knot with the Reddit co-founder \u2014 explained that she recognized why her father felt uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cMaybe a lot of daughters wouldn\u2019t react the same way, but I know the struggles he\u2019s had these last few years. His health is better now, but I know he still doesn\u2019t feel like himself, doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s perfect,\u201d Serena said. \u201cAnd if he doesn\u2019t want to be up there in front of a lot of people, I completely understand. Look, when we first came on the scene, there were a lot of people who didn\u2019t get him. I don\u2019t think a lot of them wanted to get him. I don\u2019t think a lot of him could have anyway.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cOur family knows what we have. We just want each other to be happy. That\u2019s what matters. I don\u2019t think anything could ever change that.\u201d\n\nSerena ended up walking down the aisle at the Contemporary Art Center of New Orleans solo as violinists performed \u201cHow Far I\u2019ll Go\u201d from the movie Moana.\n\nSang Tan/AP/REX/Shutterstock\n\nAlexandra Macon, a Vogue editor who covered the wedding for the magazine, revealed that Serena completely kept her composure despite the sudden change of plans.\n\n\u201cI can only imagine how all over the place her emotions must have been, but she radiated a sense of calm, even when things went wrong,\u201d Macon wrote for Vogue.com. \u201cUnbeknownst to me at the time, her father and longtime coach, Richard, texted her an hour before the wedding was supposed to start, saying that he didn\u2019t feel comfortable walking her down the aisle.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Serena Williams Gives Her Best Wedding Advice For Friend Meghan Markle: \u2018Eat Cake!\u2019\n\nSerena\u2019s friend Meghan Markle will also be without her father on her upcoming wedding day. The actress confirmed, Wednesday, that Thomas Markle will not be at her wedding to Prince Harry this Saturday.\n\n\u201cSadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health,\u201d she said in a statement from Kensington Palace. \u201cI would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t miss out!

He remains hospitalized, according to TMZ.\n\nA royal source couldn\u2019t confirm the operation to PEOPLE, but said of Meghan\u2019s father, \u201cHe has told Meghan he cannot attend due to medical reasons.\u201d\n\nMeghan, 36, and Harry, 33, are due to wed at St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle on Saturday.\n\nThe decision on who will walk Meghan down the aisle will be made \u201cin due course,\u201d a palace source told PEOPLE.\n\nWilliams has previously shared her wedding day advice for Meghan, telling ABC News, \u201cI think it\u2019s so important to enjoy the moment and eat cake.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get to eat mine at the wedding. We were just having so much fun!\u201d", "images":
