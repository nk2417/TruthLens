The actress, who stars in the upcoming female-centric Netflix series GLOW, recently opened up about an audition from her past that was wildly inappropriate, to say the least.\n\nFollowing a screening of her new series, in which Brie plays a struggling actress who, tired of the one-dimensional roles she's usually asked to read for, is ultimately cast in a league of female wrestlers, she got real about how different working on the show was from the industry sexism characteristic of the 1980s setting it depicts\u2014and how much of Hollywood is still pretty sexist. \"It has not changed that much,\" Brie told Entertainment Weekly. \"The audition process has not changed that much.\"\n\nBrie revealed that years ago, in an audition for the HBO series Entourage, the casting panel asked her to take her top off. She said, \"Early in my career, I auditioned for three lines on an episode of Entourage that I had to go on in a bikini! Or like shorts and the tiniest shorts. And they were like, 'OK, can you take your top off now?'\"\n\nJennifer Euston, the casting director for GLOW, later took to Twitter to share her disdain for the experience Brie had. She tweeted, \"...makes me sick there are producers who abuse their power & if there was a Casting Director present, they did nothing? Inexcusable.\"", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/6902550543870bc942f7c5c3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690e460e839f3ecee7a0b476/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/69029cc5808cfecdbc4919ff/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/593e92f375eb7a0289a89e04/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-509501890.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/593e92f375eb7a0289a89e04/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-509501890.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/67a23d1cd1380148e0159eab/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690b97320073fb740a2809dc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68fa94268b4d1b984ef3ef23/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_640%2Cq_80%2Cw_640/v1497032916/glamour_the-11-most-shocking-moments-on-american-idol.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691103b499dd90c7e1bb1bfc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6903b5c553adbbd18445744c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68d748296ae85e2583754946/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5e4967dcc142f40008ca7346/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/glamour-banner-v2.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/logo-oneNav.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/620d55d803e4447bb1303cbe/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/593e92f375eb7a0289a89e04/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-509501890.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chelsea Stone"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/alison-brie-entourage-audition", "title": "Alison Brie Says She Was Asked to Take Her Top Off During 'Entourage' Audition", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Chelsea Stone", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Alison Brie recently opened up about an audition from her past that was inappropriate, to say the least.", "id": "593e93abee96996f3f743913", "keywords": "alison brie,entourage,sexism", "news_keywords": "alison brie,entourage,sexism", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "593e93abee96996f3f743913", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Alison Brie recently opened up about an audition from her past that was inappropriate, to say the least.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/593e92f375eb7a0289a89e04/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-509501890.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/593e92f375eb7a0289a89e04/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-509501890.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "UGH.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/593e92f375eb7a0289a89e04/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-509501890.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "You'll Cringe When You Hear What Alison Brie Was Asked to During an 'Entourage' Audition", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/alison-brie-entourage-audition"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-06-12T14:08:42.293Z", "modified_time": "2017-06-12T14:15:00.000Z", "author": "Chelsea Stone"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "UGH.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/593e92f375eb7a0289a89e04/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-509501890.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "You'll Cringe When You Hear What Alison Brie Was Asked to During an 'Entourage' Audition"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/593e92f375eb7a0289a89e04/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/GettyImages-509501890.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497276522.293, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
