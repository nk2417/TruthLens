It\u2019s been quite a journey for the cast of Teen Mom. The series launched in December 2009 as the first spinoff from MTV\u2019s 16 and Pregnant. The debut season followed the lives of Maci Bookout, Catelynn Lowell, Amber Portwood and Farrah Abraham, who all experienced very different journeys during their teen pregnancies. On season 5, [\u2026]\n\nFans first speculated that Lopez was the baby\u2019s father last week when Lowry shared an Instagram photo of herself cradling her baby bump with the caption, \u201cHappy bump day from Baby Lo & me.\u201d Some people guessed that \u201cLo\u201d came from Lowry\u2019s own last name, while others suggested that she was referring to her friend Lopez.\n\nThe 16 and Pregnant alum confirmed her third pregnancy in late February, but had yet to identify the father. She already has two sons: Isaac, 7, with ex Jo Rivera, and Lincoln, 3, with ex-husband Javi Marroquin.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Babies 2016 Chrissy Teigen, Kelly Clarkson, James Van Der Beek, Allison Holker and more stars welcomed adorable babies into the world in 2016. See who else was blessed with a bundle of joy!\n\n\u201cPlease know this was a choice I made,\u201d Lowry wrote of her pregnancy in a February 24 blog post. \u201cI already know some won\u2019t agree but I\u2019ve been showered with support by the ones I love since I found out. Why did I wait? I\u2019ve had a lot of health complications leading up to this pregnancy and I was not ready to release such private information on my own just yet being that I am so high risk with this pregnancy. I didn\u2019t want to announce just to have another miscarriage and suffer through another grief. \u2026 I know this isn\u2019t an ideal situation but I know everything will be okay.\u201d\n\nIn addition to preparing for the upcoming birth of her third bundle of joy, the MTV star is set to graduate from Delaware State University later this month. She shared a series of adorable cap and gown photos with her sons on her blog on Sunday, April 30. \u201cThis has been an extremely long and emotional road for me and for my family,\u201d she wrote.",
