Mia Maestro (Alias, The Strain) will play Rosa, a true-believer member of The Movement for Coherent Philosophy who is starting to doubt her involvement in the organization.\n\nMeanwhile, Ronny Cox (St. Elsewhere, Stargate SG-1) has been cast as Deacon's father, Gideon Claybourne. Per the official character description, Gideo is a \"recently reformed lifelong alcoholic\" and \"crusty, frustrated, would-be musician\" who'll enter the action as he tries to repair his relationship with his son.\n\n\"It was just such a happy turn of events for us that we could get\" Cox, Nashville co-showrunner Marshall Herskovitz tells TVLine. \"It just gives us a real chance to do real drama, a story about a really badly sundered relationship where these two men have not seen each other in many years.\"\n\nHerskovitz adds that Cox will sing during his time on the show.\n\nPress PLAY on the video above to see a preview of the second half of the season, then hit the comments with your thoughts!", "images": ["https://www.tvline.com/img/TVLine-Icon-RGB-Default-Color.svg", "https://www.tvline.com/img/TVLine-Logo-RGB-Default-Color.svg", "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/news/nashville-series-finale-date-cmt-video-917955/nashville.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/news/nashville-series-finale-date-cmt-video-917955/nashville.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kimberly Roots"], "canonical_link": "https://www.tvline.com/news/nashville-series-finale-date-cmt-video-917955/", "title": "'Nashville' Sets Series Finale Date", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "thumbnail": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/news/nashville-series-finale-date-cmt-video-917955/nashville.jpg", "description": "'Nashville' sets series finale date.
