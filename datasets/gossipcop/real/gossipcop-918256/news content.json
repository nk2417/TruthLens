The comedian tricked the audience into thinking they were going to see a special preview of Ava DuVernay\u2019s \u201cA Wrinkle in Time.\u201d\n\nKimmel and the group of celebrities then crashed the screening, walking into the theater with popcorn, candy, and hot dog cannons carried by Ansel Elgort and Armie Hammer. \u201cWe brought you some goodies,\u201d Gadot told the crowd as Kimmel announced to the theater that they were on live television at the Oscars.\n\n\u201cThis is so much better than the Oscars!\u201d Gadot exclaimed.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe skit was similar to the memorable Oscar moment last year when Kimmel ushered a group of tourists into the Dolby Theatre to take selfies with nominees such as Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, and Viola Davis. Denzel Washington even officiated a wedding during the skit.\n\n\u201cWe were talking about our appreciation for people who go to the movies, and those are you people, so thank you,\u201d Kimmel said. He also joked that the theater smelled like marijuana.\n\nThe \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d host also asked one of the shocked guests to announce the next two presenters: Tiffany Haddish and Maya Rudolph. He chuckled as the man flubbed Haddish\u2019s name.\n\nPOPULAR VIDEO:", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gal-gadot-margot-robbie-oscars-suprise.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://source.unsplash.com/random/595x333", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gal-gadot-margot-robbie-oscars-suprise.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ariana Brockington", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/oscars-kimmel-gal-gadot-crash-wrinkle-in-time-screening-1202717550/", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel, Gal Gadot, Lupita Nyong\u2019o Crash \u2018A Wrinkle in Time\u2019 Screening During Oscars", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel brought Gal Gadot, Margot Robbie, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, and more to a packed movie theater for another meet-the-stars Oscar moment.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Ariana Brockington", "tags": "Gal Gadot, Jimmy Kimmel, Lupita Nyong'o, Margot Robbie, Oscars", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel, Gal Gadot, Lupita Nyong\u2019o Crash \u2018A Wrinkle in Time\u2019 Screening During Oscars", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/oscars-kimmel-gal-gadot-crash-wrinkle-in-time-screening-1202717550/", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel brought Gal Gadot, Margot Robbie, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, and more to a packed movie theater for another meet-the-stars Oscar moment.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gal-gadot-margot-robbie-oscars-suprise.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Gal Gadot Margot Robbie Oscars Suprise"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-05T03:55:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-05T05:22:04+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jimmy Kimmel brought Gal Gadot, Margot Robbie, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, and more to a packed movie theater for another meet-the-stars Oscar moment.", "site": "@variety", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel, Gal Gadot, Lupita Nyong\u2019o Crash \u2018A Wrinkle in Time\u2019 Screening During Oscars", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gal-gadot-margot-robbie-oscars-suprise.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/TfMfQun6tlA?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1520222141.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
