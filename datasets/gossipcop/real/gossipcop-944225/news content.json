(That's one donation each for her, husband John Legend and their two children, Luna and Miles.)\n\n\u201cJohn and I are outraged to see and hear the horror stories of immigrant families seeking asylum and refuge in America being ripped apart due to the inhumane policies of the Trump administration,\" Teigen wrote. \"These actions are cruel, anti-family and go against everything we believe this country should represent.\"\n\nShe continued, \"On this auspicious occasion, in order to Make Trump\u2019s Birthday Great Again, each member of our family has donated $72,000 to the ACLU.\u201d\n\nShe encouraged her followers, \"Wish Donald a happy birthday with a donation to the ACLU,\" preferably in installments of \"$7.20, $72 or whatever you like.\"\n\nNeed a news break?
