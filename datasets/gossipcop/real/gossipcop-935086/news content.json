Chesnot/WireImage On the morning of June 29, 2020, beauty conglomerate Coty announced it had reached a deal with Kardashian West to acquire a 20 percent stake in KKW Beauty for $200 million, valuing the star's cosmetics and fragrance business at $1 billion. Forbes reports that the sale makes Kardashian West's net worth an estimated $900 million. According to the official release, Coty will help Kardashian West expand the brand into more categories including skincare, haircare, personal care and nail products while also bringing the items into more global markets. Kardashian West and her team will continue to lead all creative efforts of product and communications initiatives, especially through her massive reach on social media (the star has 242.5 million followers and counting on Twitter and Instagram combined). Husband Kanye praised his wife for her milestone achievement on Twitter the night of the announcement. \"I am so proud of my beautiful wife Kim Kardashian West for officially becoming a billionaire,\" Kanye wrote on Twitter. \"You've weathered the craziest storms and now God is shining on you and our family.\"\n\n02 of 06 Kris Jenner: $37.5 Million Kevin Winter/Getty Images The matriarch of the family has an estimated $37.5 million net worth as of July 15, 2018, according to Forbes, and was also ranked the 84th highest paid celebrity of that year. The outlet credits Kris' momager percentages and her own seven figure salary for being the mastermind behind Keeping Up With the Kardashians, which is currently in its 18th season, for her financial status.\n\n03 of 06 Kourtney Kardashian: $35 Million Vivien Killilea/Getty Images The eldest Kardashian's net worth is estimated at $35 million, according to Money in 2018. A majority of her fortune comes from her KUWTK salary as a star and executive producer. The mom of three also makes her money from her many social media endorsement deals, such as Lyfe Tea. Since 2018, Kourtney has launched her own lifestyle brand called Poosh, which has added to her growing empire.\n\n04 of 06 Kylie Jenner: $900 million Kylie Jenner. Kevin Mazur/Getty Images After Forbes named Kylie the youngest self-made billionaire on March 5, 2019, the outlet published an explosive report a year later, on May 29, 2020, saying that the youngest Jenner was no longer a billionaire in a report titled \"Inside Kylie Jenner's Web of Lies \u2014 And Why She's No Longer a Billionaire.\" \"What am i even waking up to,\" Jenner tweeted in response to the article. \"i thought this was a reputable site.. all i see are a number of inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol. i've never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there EVER. period,\" the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star added. Forbes' most recent June 2020 report says that after selling 51 percent of Kylie Cosmetics to Coty in January 2019 for $600 million, Jenner took home $590 million, pretax. She also has a net worth of $900 million as of June 30, 2020.\n\n05 of 06 Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian: $40 Million Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian. Dia Dipasupil/Getty As of 2018, Khlo\u00e9 is worth an estimated $40 million, Money reports. The culmination of her wealth can be attributed to starring on KUWTK, her latest show Revenge Body with Khloe Kardashian, her clothing line Good American and several endorsement deals.", "images":
