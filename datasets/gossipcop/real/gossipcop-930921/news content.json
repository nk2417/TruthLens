If anyone is going to end my career, okay, it\u2019s going to be me,\u201d he added. He then launched into a 10-minute segment in which he and his friends pick up his $150,000-plus custom Mercedes SUV.\n\nThe move comes after widespread criticism of Paul for his insensitivity and poor behavior in multiple incidents, including a vlog from late December where he filmed the body of an apparent suicide victim in a Japanese forest. During the same trip to Japan, Paul had earlier released vlogs where he \u201cwav[ed] raw fish in Japanese people\u2019s faces, dress[ed] up like Pikachu and [threw] a plush Pokeball at random people in the street, including a police officer.\u201d\n\nAlthough he later apologized, YouTube temporarily suspended ad revenue on his channels and put his YouTube Red projects on hold, citing a \u201crecent pattern of behavior.\u201d After taking several weeks away from vlogging to \u201creflect,\u201d Paul returned in late January with a video titled \u201cSuicide: Be Here Tomorrow,\u201d where he spoke with the director of the National Suicide Prevention Hotline and said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to start a new chapter in my life.\u201d\n\nThis new chapter soon included jokes about swallowing Tide Pods and a vlog in which he pulled a koi fish out of a pond and pretended to give it CPR and tased a dead rat, indicating that he had learned very little. Once again, YouTube temporarily suspended ads on his channel.\n\nIn his latest video, a characteristically manic Paul explains that he is stepping back from regular vlogging because he has \u201cdiversified, bro,\u201d and he plugs an upcoming talk show called Impulsive, though it\u2019s unclear whether he\u2019s referring to his brother Jake\u2019s forthcoming YouTube Red talk show or something else entirely. He further promises \u201cthe vlog will never be finished as long as my heart stays thumping\u201d and that \u201cyour boy [Logan Paul] will get more and more and more lit.\u201d His daily content will be missed, by some.", "images": ["https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/openai-group-chats.webp?quality=90&strip=all&crop=21.875%2C0%2C56.25%2C100&w=2400",
