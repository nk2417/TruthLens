However, Angelina surprised her by candidly apologizing for remarks she'd made in the past, including mocking Snooki's lip injections.\n\nAngelina promised that she'd come back to \"redeem\" herself, and to \"show people I'm not this crazy girl.\" Her persistence paid off, and with Ronnie Ortiz-Magro championing her to Snooki, and convincing her to let Angelina party with them.\n\nThe two former enemies managed to quickly move past their drama and began enjoying each other's company, i.e. getting totally wasted and coming home drunk, hanging off one another like life-long pals.\n\nJWoww was understandably furious when she came home to find them acting like besties, but eventually, she came around herself and accepted Angelina into her good graces.\n\nAddressing the house, Angelina admitted that she had said 'f**ked up s**t\" in the past.\n\n\"I was spiteful, I was immature and I shouldn\u2019t have went that way,\" she said. \"I want a clean slate where from this point forward, no problems.\n\nWhile the cast all accepted her back and were on board with the decision to put the feud behind them, they also all agreed that Jersey Shore Family Vacation should really be about the core group who all came to Miami together, and that Angelina should head out.\n\nEventually, the task of breaking the news to Angelina fell to JWoww, who told her former nemesis, \"You are a good person, I would like to get to know you more, but I don\u2019t want to get to know you more here.\"\n\nFans will get to see how Angelina reacts to getting ousted when Jersey Shore Family Vacation returns next Thursday at 8 p.m. ET/PT on MTV.\n\nRecently, ET caught up with Vinny Guadagnino who opened up about what it was like having Angelina return to the house.
