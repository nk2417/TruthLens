Paramount reportedly would not allow Cavill to shave his facial hair while production was taking place, so his mustache will have to be digitally removed from \u201cJustice League\u201d in post-production.\n\nHe facetiously clarified the actual reasoning in his post. \u201cThere has been no discussion over whether to shave or not to shave for the [\u2018Justice League\u2019] reshoots, simply a relentless campaign to put an end to the seemingly inexorable conquest of this despotic \u2018stache. It is not a question of if I should shave \u2014 it is a question of how we can possibly be victorious against such a beast without bringing our own doom raining down upon us.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cJustice League,\u201d also staring Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, and Ezra Miller, hits theaters Nov. 17.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/henry-cavill.png?w=1000&h=564&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/henry-cavill.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/henry-cavill.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Rubin", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/film/news/henry-cavill-justice-league-mustache-controversy-1202507649/", "title": "Henry Cavill Addresses \u2018Justice League\u2019 Mustache Controversy", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Henry Cavill addresses the controversy surrounding his mustache in \"Justice League\" in a silly Instagram post.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Rebecca Rubin", "tags": "Henry Cavill, Justice League", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Henry Cavill Addresses \u2018Justice League\u2019 Mustache Controversy", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/film/news/henry-cavill-justice-league-mustache-controversy-1202507649/", "description": "Henry Cavill addresses the controversy surrounding his mustache in \"Justice League\" in a silly Instagram post.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/henry-cavill.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Henry Cavill"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-26T22:27:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-26T22:53:45+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Henry Cavill addresses the controversy surrounding his mustache in \"Justice League\" in a silly Instagram post.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@rebeccaarubin", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Henry Cavill Addresses \u2018Justice League\u2019 Mustache Controversy", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/henry-cavill.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501108078.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
