Super, super excited,\u201d Bila told Us. \u201cI always wanted to get married, but I never thought I would do the big wedding dress and the beautiful venue. I always thought I was gonna be on a beach somewhere, just a couple of friends, doing it really casual. So it\u2019s crazy.\u201d\n\nThe star, who donned a Rivini lace ballgown and earrings from Susan Hanover, selected a white gold eternity style wedding band with wraparound diamonds.

But my wedding has so many traditional components, it\u2019s so funny.\u201d\n\nOf the ceremony, which was attended by 60 people including View host Sunny Hostin, the New York native gushed: \u201cWhat I\u2019m looking forward to the most [about my wedding day] is that moment of walking down the aisle and seeing him and having him see me and having that moment where we\u2019re in front together. And we\u2019re just looking at each other. I\u2019ll be in my dress and he\u2019ll be in his tux. It\u2019s just one of those once in a lifetime moments that I kind of want to hold onto.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Engagements of 2018 Bring on the bling!

And you\u2019re like, \u2018My life is gonna be different from here on and I\u2019m gonna be married.\u2019 It\u2019s really exciting and warm and wonderful.
