{"url": "https://www.avclub.com/riverdale-s-the-tell-tale-heart-explores-the-code-of-1822832349", "text": "As Riverdale\u2019s take on the mob movie genre, \u201cChapter Twenty-Five: The Wicked And The\n\nDivine\u201d was a visually striking\n\nepisode. Naturally, \u201cChapter Twenty-Six: The Tell-Tale Heart\u201d is a comedown\n\nfrom that. It\u2019s not as big, it\u2019s not as opulent; the event-of-the-week is dead\n\nbody disposal. That\u2019s not to say the show no longer looks special,\n\nbecause it always does. But this week, it looks notably different for another\n\nreason: The\n\nVampire Diaries creator Julie Plec directed the episode. In the world\n\nof The CW, that\u2019s quite the get. It\u2019s also morbidly appropriate, considering\n\nall the blood.\n\nPrior to the\n\ntitle card, the Cooper scenes even look like they could fit perfectly into an\n\nepisode of Vampire Diaries, with or without the blood. Going from typical Riverdale dark blue tint (which we were originally left with at the\n\nend of \u201cChapter Twenty-Five\u201d) to the bright gold is like a sudden crash back to\n\nreality. At least, Riverdale\u2019s version\n\nof \u201creality.\u201d Riverdale loves to keep\n\nthings like this in the dark, except for here, where the bloody scene is as\n\nbright as it possibly can be. But it\u2019s the shot where Betty lays her head down\n\nto sleep and it goes from night to day that most owes itself to Plec\u2019s past\n\nwork, as there is nothing less Riverdale\u2014yet\n\nso very Vampire Diaries\u2014than Betty\n\nwaking up, greeted by rays of sunshine through her window. It\u2019s the most sun\n\nthere\u2019s ever been on this show, and it\u2019s a devilishly cheeky choice, due to what happened the night before.\n\nThis episode\n\nfeatures the best version of Betty we\u2019ve seen in a long time. It also serves as\n\na reminder of Betty\u2019s strength that made her the clear hero of this series: her\n\nneed to get things done, even in the worst circumstances. While it seems like a\n\nbad idea at first, taking the shady man\u2019s phone leads to her finding out Chic called\n\nhim in the first place. She\u2019s finally starting to see him for the\n\nmanipulator he is, and the only thing preventing her from getting to the bottom\n\nof Chic is Alice. To quote \u201cThe Tell-Tale Heart\u201d: \u201cThe disease had sharpened my\n\nsenses\u2014not destroyed\u2014not dulled them.\u201d Only, in Betty\u2019s case, she hasn\u2019t actually gone mad.\n\nHowever,\n\nthis is getting dangerously close to me suggesting trauma makes Betty sharper,\n\nwhich is almost as bad of a take as Riverdale\u2019s\n\nentire approach to mental illness. Even though she gets stuff done here, Betty\u2019s far\n\nfrom 100%. Don\u2019t forget the bizarre moment of\n\nher wiping down every individual apple for possible fingerprints\u2026 right after\n\nAlice tells her the shady man didn\u2019t touch them at all. (Also, of the two lines\n\nChic has this episode, neither of mention what his dealer\u2019s name was. So\n\nwe\u2019re stuck with \u201cThe Shady Man.\u201d) She\u2019s also flashing back to the bloody\n\nmurder scene almost every waking moment. The good news is, she asks Jughead for\n\nhelp. So many things happening on this show right now could be solved if these\n\ncharacters just asked each other for help.\n\nThis is all\n\nfollow-up to Jughead and Betty having sex for the first time, and in all the\n\nstress, Betty basically forgets it happened until Jughead brings it up. But\n\nthat\u2019s only the first in a long line of actual communication between these two\n\nin this episode! That sounds normal, but this entire season has proven that\u2019s\n\napparently a novel concept. \u201cChapter Twenty-Six\u201d is a good episode for\n\nthis plot\u2019s core four\u2014Reinhart, Sprouse, Amick, and Ulrich\u2014who all give\n\ncompelling performances and have something substantial to work with. The code\n\nof silence between these four has a weight to it that is severely lacking in\n\nthe plot that actually mentions the very concept. Jughead is still in crusader mode here, but it\u2019s at a bearable level, especially since he has a leg to stand on for once and figures out the Lodge/McCoy land conspiracy.\n\nMadelaine Petsch is again\n\ngiven very little to do as Cheryl, but since her small parts intersect\n\nwith this plot, it\u2019s worth noting that she makes a lot out of the little she\n\nhas. Would that she could threaten a disappointing Riverdale parent every\n\nepisode. She even has the line of the episode:", "images": ["https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/avuploads/2025/11/12174022/tcc6-recap-squared.jpg",
