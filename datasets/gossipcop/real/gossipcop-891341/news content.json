She has a little rap for you recapping the entire first season, and it\u2019s epic.\n\nDuring her appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\u201d on Oct. 31, host Jimmy Fallon remembered he made the young actress rap to Nicki Minaj the last time she was on the show. This time, Brown said she\u2019d rap again, but only if she could do a recap of the first season.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go back to Indiana, circa Nineteen Eighty-Three/ Just four boys in the basement chillin\u2019 playin\u2019 D&D/ There was Lucas there was Willy Will and Dustin, there was Mike/ But one night Will goes missing while he\u2019s riding on his bike \u2013 yikes,\u201d Brown raps.\n\nAnd yes, the \u201cStranger Things\u201d star also raps about Eleven\u2019s love for Eggo waffles, and even mentions the blasted Demogorgon, Dr. Brenner and Joyce \u2014 and her obsession with Christmas lights.\n\n\u201cAll I need is my Eggo waffles, I\u2019m in love with those/ What I\u2019m left with when I use my powers is a bloody nose,\u201d she quips, before dropping the mic and walking off stage.\n\nThe second season of \u201cStranger Things\u201d premiered last week. It also stars David Harbour, Winona Ryder, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer and Joe Keery.\n\nWatch the video above.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5x4_082025_COVER.jpg?fit=240%2C300&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?resize=150%2C150&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MillieBobbyBrown.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?fit=53%2C58&quality=80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MillieBobbyBrown.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Film Editor", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/millie-bobby-brown-raps-stranger-things-recap-drops-mic-video/", "title": "Millie Bobby Brown Raps \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Recap, Drops Mic (Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Millie Bobby Brown Raps 'Stranger Things' Recap, Drops Mic (Video)", "description": "Yes, the actress mentions Eggo waffles and the Demogorgon", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/millie-bobby-brown-raps-stranger-things-recap-drops-mic-video/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MillieBobbyBrown.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2017-11-01T15:32:52+00:00"}, "author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "caleb-mclaughlin, david-harbour, finn-wolfhard, gaten-matarazzo, hopper-dance, jimmy-fallon, joe-keery, millie-bobby-brown, nicki_minaj, stranger-things, winona_ryder", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "tv, videos", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509550372.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
