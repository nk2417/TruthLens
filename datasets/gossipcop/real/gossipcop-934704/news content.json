Graduating and having a celebrity deliver your graduation speech. Well, there\u2019s maybe ONE thing that could top that: Having Oprah Winfrey deliver your graduation speech. On Friday, May 11th, she did exactly that at the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School for Communications and Journalism.\n\nSure, a celebrity commencement speech might feel a tad gimmicky. But many famous people are more than worthy of speaking to a giant crowd of graduates. Oprah is a perfect example of that. In 2017, Pharrell Williams used his NYU commencement speech to send an important message about women\u2019s rights. That same year, Janelle Mon\u00e1e spoke to Dillard University about the American Dream, and it still brings tears to our eyes. Lauren Graham\u2019s commencement speech at her own Langley High School in 2017 was so well-received, she recently published it as a book called In Conclusion, Don\u2019t Worry About It.\n\nShonda Rhimes, Michelle Obama, Dame Helen Mirren, Katie Couric, Nora Ephron \u2014 all of these people have delivered commencement speeches that have changed the minds and lives of so many graduates. (And non-graduates, and graduated-a-long-time-ago graduates.)\n\nOprah\u2019s USC commencement speech is full of wise wisdom for everybody.\n\nShe\u2019s easily one of the most inspirational, influential, and powerful humans on Earth. When she speaks, we all listen. And Oprah\u2019s USC commencement speech had it all: warnings, realism, hope, and a beautiful quote from Maya Angelou. She kicked off her speech with some \u201cbad news\u201d about communication, reminding us that we\u2019re in a tough place right now.\n\n\"Everything around us, including and in particular the internet and social media, is now being used to erode trust in our institutions, interfere in our elections, and wreak havoc on our infrastructure. It hands advertisers a map to our deepest desires, it enables misinformation to run rampant, attention spans to run short, and false stories from phony sites to run circles around major news outlets. We have literally walked into traffic while staring at our phones.\"\n\nOprah went on to note the \u201cfalse stories from phony sites\u201d that are \u201crun[ning] circles around major news outlets.\u201d She\u2019s obviously not wrong, and reminding a group of Communications and Journalism majors that they have a responsibility to fight fake news is a powerful approach to a commencement speech.\n\nNaturally, Oprah had some positive pieces of wisdom to share as well.\n\nShe didn\u2019t leave the grads with the disappointing realism about the state of the news right now. She instilled in them a sense of responsibility, hope, and courage.\n\n\"The good news is there really is a solution. And the solution is each and every one of you because you will become the new editorial gatekeepers, an ambitious army of truth-seekers who will arm yourselves with the intelligence and the insight and the facts necessary to strike down deceit. You're in a position to keep all of those who now disparage real news, you are the ones who are going to keep those people in check.\"\n\n\u201cAmbitious army of truth-seekers\u201d is a title almost as exciting as \u201cUSC Graduate.\u201d We hope that goes on each and every one of their resumes.\n\nWe already know that Oprah is an incredible person who embodies justice, strength, and pure badassness. Her full USC commencement speech is worth a watch regardless of who you are or what you majored in. People with Communications and Journalism degrees do have a responsibility to this nation, but so do all of us.\n\nWatch Oprah\u2019s full USC commencement speech below.\n\nLike Oprah said, we have to declare war on cynicism. We can all do that.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180513060548im_/https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/10072547/avatar-h-150x150.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513060548im_/https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/05/12112159/picture-of-oprah-usc-commencement-speech-photo.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513060548im_/https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2017/11/03023135/xoxo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513060548im_/https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/04/09164343/newsletter-illustration.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513060548im_/https://images.hellogiggles.com/uploads/2018/05/12112159/picture-of-oprah-usc-commencement-speech-photo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Tholmer"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180513060548/https://hellogiggles.com/news/oprah-winfrey-usc-commencement-speech/", "title": "Oprah Winfrey's USC commencement speech is an inspiring reminder that we have the power to fight fake news", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "college,hope,news,oprah,oprah winfrey,powerful quotes,speech,TRENDING,trending news,usc,video,Politics", "news_keywords": "college,hope,news,oprah,oprah winfrey,powerful quotes,speech,TRENDING,trending news,usc,video,Politics", "description": "Oprah Winfrey delivered a powerful commencement speech at USC reminding the world that fake news is a real problem, but we can all fight it with hope, positivity, and action.
