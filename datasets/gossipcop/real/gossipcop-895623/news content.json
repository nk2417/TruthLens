And now I\u2019ve realized in the last month, that I can\u2019t even keep up with her during the day so I\u2019ve had to introduce one bottle of formula a day. I\u2019m trying to pump and do all this stuff, but it\u2019s the stress. I hate pumping. To the point it makes me feel bad when I\u2019m doing it because I\u2019m so miserable.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not only the physical and emotional stress that affects the WWE star, who welcomed her now-17-month-old child with husband, fellow wrestler Daniel Bryan. \u201cThe guilt always plays in. Mom guilt\u2019s the worst feeling in the world,\u201d Bella admits.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

My body is feeding my child. But at the same time, I don\u2019t want to lose myself, I don\u2019t want to lose my career,\u201d Brie says. \u201cI want to balance both and that\u2019s what I thought pumping could balance Birdie and my job, but it\u2019s not working. It\u2019s weird how you just constantly feel like you\u2019re failing.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: WWE Superstars Brie & Nikki Bella on Bonding With Birdie: \u2018[It\u2019s] the Most Incredible Thing in the World\u2019\n\nThough she did not make a decision to continue or stop breastfeeding, the star concludes: \u201cThese women make me feel like it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t want to breastfeed anymore or it\u2019s okay to still balance it. To have other women just be like, \u2018You do you. That\u2019s all you have to do.\u2019 I haven\u2019t felt that in a while, so it means a lot to me right now.\u201d\n\nBrie previously donated to families in need as seen in an episode of Total Divas. \u201cI have extra milk and I don\u2019t want it to stay in my freezer forever till I have to throw it away. If babies can benefit from it, then I want to do this,\u201d she said at the time.\n\nAnd in August 2017, the proud parent shared a hilarious breastfeeding story on her YouTube channel.\n\n\u201cIn the middle of the night, as you all know, I do a little pumping. Well, guess who forgot their pumping heads? So guess what I did?\u201d Bella told fans. \u201cI sat there, and I was in a lot of pain\u2026I was in a lot of pain and I was like, \u2018Well, pumps had to just like come into existence not long ago, what did people do back in the day, right Bird?\u2019 I was really thinking about this. I was thinking, \u2018How do they pump cows?\u2019 So last night in the bathroom, I went in there and I opened up the baggy part and I milked myself like a cow. And guess what? I got six ounces! I\u2019m very proud of this.\u201d\n\nTotal Divas airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on E!", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/oMUZz2cyLcOjzIX2M8G-6I4RVm8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/justin-bieber-twitch-111425-1886133efffd4a5f953d3c4698854457.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/LztNjwaQ-ix4eK4edUooLhNiWi4=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anna-kepner-3-111025-c6a90b2f57474459a89ae04e296ec343.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lTaKiwwH0Gs45XPo9tfeL5hfpgY=/343x228/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/teddi-mellencamp-BravoCon-2025-111425-6332311b176c4e73809cd461363553b0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8H4Jdi2RG_ZC_AlmBHb599_HeZA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/teddi-mellencamp-BravoCon-2025-111425-6332311b176c4e73809cd461363553b0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Zr7DxHXJEqWAcKyk6dLEyUV9RAM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chris-hemsworth-father-3-111825-97dd2206b4fa4f81bb547fc64d9117d5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/d4e6Nt1LZzo2S-5EdxRSkg6d3UM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bernie-Kosar-Liver-Transplant-update-111725-cb0e7b8b8ac848f4ae9071e50a76057a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/XAJIom2EE2SdW-6zEhtyF9TYTtI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/susan-powter-then-now-111825-2bd6b8c0be63451793d960aabe937330.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/uOCRdsQMM9adQMapmGKYVQy5Vc4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/robert-irwin-and-witney-carson-dwts-111425-e180eb569023497e91cd07ec6de3b5d3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/LFzyr2JV0n15weMhaE9Dd1LPmj8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ozzy-osbourne-111325-9b3c3080070d4d3c84e6c2c5b2e9c8db.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/vcTYOccEJBinPpl8eC9jQB1vIm0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Mark-Consuelos-111725-d57106729a99499a8b4b35cb0664bc3b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/BB7vYW82d0oBPiFINmr76DIy2dY=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ben-dreyfuss-richard-dreyfuss-111925-b670f8ab6f994d1d9dfce1fa0726d205.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/lY3n3jOr0Hiez6WfeBG9KpdGuwE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/brie-bella-2000-9e1191f255a1415da2317338b5c2be91.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/754Q3FbNC5MgQ3aT55k3q4_Czks=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kim-Petras-111325-1-79579b0ecb844a09af68065b84d74086.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/NaZC7t3dF6Nq4e1Zvo2V9jxw8Eg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/audra-macdonald-1-111325-bbac1ef9c5da44cc8a265276be91181f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/otNladwLq0yOzwYgfyn8EaNQ7Mo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/DOLLY-PARTON_PEOPLE_4-bc170f747b6c45ceb0991964adcc47e6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ApX5jaJb0mVjNYAky8sStFiUnpg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lady-gaga-rolling-stone-1-111325-a287ea97073847d7b1afe7bf689fe6a4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/B1Tx5yIBR4v4G5z0e_Wg_IaFKSg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Brian-May-premiere-The-Wizard-of-Oz-at-Sphere-111725-e925887a13ee4a0db9b876a3204fe532.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/6quZv8N3hHJm0MNpeoCoi6orgYA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bella-Hadid-111425-f2e2ab39a20c402a93aed098ced14563.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/pLkorFq-V3frLTD9_DAH5rhzwwM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/yungblud-111725-1-dbd9fbef341c4667a9539236fee0476a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/cgmMqBSYNL6keNeUAuvLNj3DUNs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nicole-eggert-111425-a81b775edc084cf18fdafcdd3fc4f92e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/WhaBPebnB6W8QP4bsdCyYMMKSqs=/343x228/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/chris-hemsworth-father-3-111825-97dd2206b4fa4f81bb547fc64d9117d5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0jKnK8bSyr7Fb41sXsNwd1jtAFM=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jenna-bush-hager-minka-kelly-today-with-jenna-and-friends-111925-7e3c2b8605fe4a96a1b712c168083adb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/MyGy7nuY2mm_jwENIjUnPbJ8b0g=/343x228/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bella-Hadid-111425-f2e2ab39a20c402a93aed098ced14563.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/zdFS1n2y9dNM-ndOtRjWY9G0kI4=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Daniella-Karagach-111925-ls-1ffa54ba0f1749e380cfe98771660e16.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/lY3n3jOr0Hiez6WfeBG9KpdGuwE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/brie-bella-2000-9e1191f255a1415da2317338b5c2be91.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Mizoguchi", "Karen Mizoguchi Is A Former Associate Digital News Editor At People.
