Spielberg later denied that claim.\n\nEncountering controversy at such a young age, Fox admits that she lacked the wisdom to deal with it appropriately and instead thought of herself as a martyr.\n\n\u201cThat was absolutely the low point of my career,\u201d Fox told Cosmo. \u201cBut without \u2018that thing\u2019, I wouldn\u2019t have learned as quickly as I did. All I had to was apologize, and I refused. I was so self-righteous at 23, I couldn\u2019t see [that] it was for the greater good. I really thought I was Joan of Arc.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt hurt me and a lot of other people,\u201d she explained. \u201cHowever, that darkness that descended caused enormous and brisk spiritual growth. Once I realized I [had] brought it on myself, it was an invaluable learning experience, looking back on it.\u201d\n\nCosmopolitan\n\nNow enjoying a quieter life, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles star is focusing on her relationship with husband Beverly Hills 90210 actor Brian Austin Green and being a mom to their three kids Noah, Bodhi, and Journey. She also recently became the new face of luxury lingerie brand Fredrick\u2019s of Hollywood.\n\n", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2016-11/1280_megan_fox_brian_austin_green_GettyImages456702632_111716.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/megan_fox_gettyimages-844056968.jpg?h=76d99c26&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/megan_fox_gettyimages-844056968.jpg?h=76d99c26", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1280_brianaustingreen_082217.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/megan_fox_gettyimages-844056968.jpg?h=76d99c26", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/megan-fox-opens-up-about-being-fired-from-transformers-i-really-thought-i-was-joan-of-arc-89985", "title": "Megan Fox Opens Up About Being Fired From \u2018Transformers:' 'I Really Thought I was Joan of Arc'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/megan_fox_gettyimages-844056968.jpg?h=76d99c26", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' actress talks about the low point of her career.", "title": "Megan Fox Opens Up About Being Fired From \u2018Transformers:' 'I Really Thought I was Joan of Arc'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/megan-fox-opens-up-about-being-fired-from-transformers-i-really-thought-i-was-joan-of-arc-89985", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' actress talks about the low point of her career.", "twitter": {"description": "The 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' actress talks about the low point of her career.", "title": "Megan Fox Opens Up About Being Fired From \u2018Transformers:' 'I Really Thought I was Joan of Arc'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/megan-fox-opens-up-about-being-fired-from-transformers-i-really-thought-i-was-joan-of-arc-89985", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/megan_fox_gettyimages-844056968.jpg?h=76d99c26", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Megan Fox Opens Up About Being Fired From \u2018Transformers:' 'I Really Thought I was Joan of Arc' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Megan Fox", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
