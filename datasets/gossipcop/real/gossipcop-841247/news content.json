She\u2019s the love of my life, but I just try to do everything to be there for her, but there\u2019s literally no appreciation for anything ever.\u2019\n\nHowever, Scott owned up to the breakdown of the long term relationship and was adamant that the 37-year-old was not aware about how much she means to him.\n\n\u2018I just hope that one day she understands that I would never want to be with anybody but her.\u2019\n\nScott and Kourtney are parents to 7-year-old Mason, Penelope, 4 and 2-year-old Reign.\n\nArrow MORE: Watch Kylie Jenner \u2018rap\u2019 along to Tyga\u2019s new track despite
