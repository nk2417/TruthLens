The horrific act of terror, which ISIS has claimed responsibility for, left 22 people dead, including Freya\u2019s friend Nell Jones.\n\nFreya was hit with shrapnel during the attack, leaving her with several fractures, burns and lacerations.\n\nFreya\u2019s sister, Georgia, shared a Facebook video last week in an effort to garner enough support to get Styles\u2019 attention and potentially put him in touch with Freya.\n\nThe girl\u2019s family has provided regular updates on her condition through blog posts since she checked into the hospital.\n\n\u201cAnother good day today for Freya after a comfortable night,\u201d read the most recent post, which was shared Monday. \u201cNext round of surgery now tomorrow p.m. \u2026 Plenty of time awake today, read her a lot of cards and letters from people, some smiles, some tears.\u201d\n\nStyles was one of many celebrities to share their heartbreak in the aftermath of the bombing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m heartbroken over what happened in Manchester tonight,\u201d he tweeted last Monday. \u201cSending love to everyone involved.\u201d\n\nGrande, meanwhile, vowed to return to the English city for a benefit concert in support of those affected by the act of terror.", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/05/29/HUBAC6N76P4S62VB5Y3VGLFW4A.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/05/29/HUBAC6N76P4S62VB5Y3VGLFW4A.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Sblendorio"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/05/29/harry-styles-calls-14-year-old-victim-of-manchester-bombing-tells-her-he-loves-her/", "title": "Harry Styles calls 14-year-old victim of Manchester bombing, tells her he loves her", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Peter Sblendorio", "canonical": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/05/29/harry-styles-calls-14-year-old-victim-of-manchester-bombing-tells-her-he-loves-her/"}, "description": "Harry Styles lifted the spirits of a teenage victim of last week's Manchester bombing by surprising her with a phone call.", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Harry Styles calls 14-year-old victim of Manchester bombing, tells her he loves her", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/05/29/harry-styles-calls-14-year-old-victim-of-manchester-bombing-tells-her-he-loves-her/", "description": "Pop star Harry Styles lifted the spirits of a teenage victim of last week\u2019s Manchester bombing by surprising her with a phone call as she recovers in the hospital.
