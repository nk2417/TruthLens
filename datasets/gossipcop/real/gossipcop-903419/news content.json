It was a moment to rival Patricia Arquette\u2019s equal pay speech at the 2015 Oscars, complete with a new set of Meryl Streep reaction GIFs to covet. But while McDormand\u2019s message of sisterhood and diversity may be capturing the attention of the internet more than anything else of late, it\u2019s really the culmination of an awards season that has seen the women of Hollywood rise up and band together like never before. Let\u2019s reflect on the most important moments.\n\nThe birth of Time\u2019s Up\n\nIt all started with Time\u2019s Up, of course, the story of which has now been written into the history books. When faced with the looming awards season \u2014 and most pressingly the Golden Globes \u2014 many of Hollywood\u2019s most powerful actresses acted with lightning speed to launch the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund (and the larger #TimesUp movement). They spread the word far and wide that this year\u2019s Golden Globes would be different, organizing the entire industry into one giant force against Harvey Weinstein and the rest of the worst of Hollywood.\n\nThe activists at the Golden Globes\n\nThe founding members of Time\u2019s Up walked the walk and talked the talk when they refused to surrender the narrative on the Golden Globes red carpet. Despite Ryan Seacrest\u2019s attempts to change the subject, these women and the fierce advocates they brought with them \u2014 Rosa Clemente, Ai-jen Poo, Billie Jean King, Tarana Burke, M\u00f3nica Ramirez, Marai Larasi, Calina Lawrence, and Sayu Jayaraman \u2014 constantly brought the conversation back to the plight of women in the face of sexual harassment.\n\nKristen Bell: SAG Awards host\n\nThe showing at the Golden Globes made for a powerful statement but also raised a question: Where does the rest of awards season go from here? The Screen Actors Guild Awards answered by installing an all-female presenters lineup and giving the first-ever hosting gig to Kristen Bell, putting the show in, quite possibly, the most capable hands ever. Seth Meyers did a fantastic job hosting the Globes, but the message felt all the more powerful when delivered by a woman.\n\nThe actress didn\u2019t shy away from addressing the big issues, but she managed to to it in an approachable and, when appropriate, funny way. She gave inspiring calls to action: \u201cWe are living in a watershed moment in time and as we march forward with active momentum and open ears, let\u2019s make sure we are leading the charge with empathy and diligence, because fear and anger never win the race.\u201d She poked fun at herself: \u201cI\u2019m Kristen Bell and I am a narcissist. Just kidding! I am an actor and tonight I am also your host.\u201d And she also raised a glass to her fellow females.\n\nThe Oscar party-turned-resistance retreat\n\nOscars week is historically marked by fancy fetes thrown to honor the nominated films \u2014 and, if we\u2019re being honest, the executives behind them \u2014 as well as sponsored dinners and cocktail parties and anything else that could be filed under fabulous. This week was just as fabulous but, thanks to some intrepid and determined (and female) industry insiders, the mood was decidedly more empowering.\n\nThat mood kicked off with a huge first: The (hopefully) inaugural EMILY\u2019s List \u201cResist, Run, Win\u201d Pre-Oscars Panel. The group, which is the nation\u2019s largest resource for women in politics and aims to help women get elected to office, teamed up with Hollywood heavyweights to discuss the current climate for women and, more importantly, help industry insiders learn how they could start making a change for good. Chelsea Handler, the co-chair of the group\u2019s Creative Council, moderated the event, which included panelists (and #MeToo activists) like Constance Wu and Padma Lakshmi (she also brought friends like Kathryn Hahn and Emmy Rossum to observe the panel).\n\nThe comedian spoke to a packed ballroom at the Four Seasons about her refusal to accept the hand that women have been dealt in the industry (and in general) and shared insights, like her belief that if Hillary Clinton had won the election, there wouldn\u2019t have been a rush to launch the #MeToo movement, as well as what she sees as a lack of women supporting other women in all aspects of life (something she experienced while trying to break into comedy).\n\nThe ode to black excellence, by black excellence\n\nA day later, more industry heavyweights gathered to mark the beginning of Women\u2019s History Month, plot world domination, most importantly, celebrate this year\u2019s most gifted entertainers at the Essence Black Women in Hollywood Awards. Yvonne Orji, of Insecure fame, hosted the luncheon that brought together the likes of Tiffany Haddish, Lena Waithe, and Time\u2019s Up founding member Tessa Thompson.\n\nRandy Shropshire/Getty Images\n\nHaddish shared with the audience her insights on staying positive through all of life\u2019s highs and lows, Waithe delivered a speech about how to speak your truth in an industry that has been less than forgiving of differences, and Thompson waxed poetic on equality and where the women\u2019s movement in Hollywood can go from here.\n\nViola Davis\u2026being Viola Davis\n\nOver Oscars weekend, Women in Film hosted its 11th annual Pre-Oscars Party, which this year took on an air of even more heightened awareness. The official raison d\u2019etre for the soir\u00e9e is honoring all of the female nominees on the Academy Awards ballots, which, while that number grows annually, continues to be upsettingly small. Viola Davis did as Viola Davis always does and gave a rallying cry to the troops, assuring the actresses in the audience that they\u2019re worthy.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re feeling less than,\u201d she said somberly. \u201cWe\u2019re at the caboose. But we\u2019re still worthy. Our complexities are worthy. This is the story of our year, and the privilege of a lifetime is being exactly who we are.\u201d\n\nEmma Stone, the evening\u2019s host, had her good friend and constant award season companion Billie Jean King in tow, and the tennis player (and inspiration for Stone\u2019s Battle of the Sexes) stepped up to the podium to give some inspiring words of her own.\n\n\u201cWomen are taught to be perfect and men are taught to be brave,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen: Stop apologizing. We don\u2019t have to be perfect.\u201d\n\nThe main event\n\nThe culmination of a season\u2019s worth of activism came quickly on Sunday, an evening that saw only the fifth female directing nominee and the first-ever female cinematography nominee. Even though neither Greta Gerwig nor Rachel Morrison took home Oscars, after several months of exhausting work there was plenty to be proud of \u2014 besides McDormand\u2019s speech, of course. Like Yance Ford, the first openly transgender director to be nominated. Or the win for A Fantastic Woman, about a young transgender waitress in Chile. Or the win for Jordan Peele \u2014 Get Out fans may have been disappointed to see it lose Best Picture to The Shape of Water, but his win for Best Screenplay was record-breaking, monumental, and inspiring.\n\nSo what\u2019s next, now that this most historical of awards seasons is complete? We all heard Frances \u2014 it\u2019s on to the inclusion riders.", "images":
