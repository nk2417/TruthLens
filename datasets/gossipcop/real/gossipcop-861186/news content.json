She was later paid A$180,000 in interest.\n\nHowever the size of the payout, Australia's largest for a defamation case, was reduced significantly on appeal.\n\nAhead of the appeal case - which Wilson did not attend in person - the actress was keen to point out that the court was not reconsidering whether she had won her case, but merely the amount paid out.\n\nAllow X content?
