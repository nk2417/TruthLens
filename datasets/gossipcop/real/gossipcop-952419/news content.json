We\u2019re really into each other. So there are going to be posts with each other because we enjoy each other\u2019s company a lot. We\u2019re really attracted to each other.\"\n\nPatrick, 36, and Rodgers first met at the 2012 ESPYs. The former IndyCar and NASCAR driver later confirmed she was dating the athlete in January of this year. Patrick has always been more open about dating Rodgers. During the interview, however, Rodgers didn't hold back about what the pair enjoy doing for fun.\n\n\"We really enjoy traveling. She went on the trip to India and Africa, and we had a blast. And we\u2019ve taken some trips domestically that have been fun,\" he shares. \"I\u2019m a little further out there in my love for history; I want to go to historical sites around the world. She\u2019s getting into it as well, but she\u2019s spontaneous. She\u2019s up for anything travel-wise, which is fun.\"\n\n\"She\u2019s a good travel partner because she\u2019s so laid-back and low-maintenance,\" he adds. \"And she\u2019s a hell of a cook, so we love just staying in, too. She eats really healthy. She\u2019s inspired me in that way.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Patrick made ESPY history when she became the awards show's first female host. Rodgers did not hold back when praising his girlfriend for that grand feat.\n\n\"I\u2019m really proud of her for that. I always enjoy going to the ESPYs, but to finally have a woman up there was awesome,\" Rodgers expresses. \"Doubly awesome that I\u2019m dating her and that I got to be in the I, Tonya spoof. I remember talking through it with her, and she was really drawn to being the first woman host. She\u2019s a strong woman who\u2019s had to fight through some gender issues in her sports for years.\"\n\nSee more on the couple in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-07/danica_patrick_aaron_rodgers_gettyimages-1001452154.jpg?h=5124c7d9&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-07/gettyimages-1001447316.jpg?h=44447c4a&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-10/danica_patrick_aaron_rodgers_gettyimages-1002163308.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-10/danica_patrick_aaron_rodgers_gettyimages-1002163308.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-01/danica_aaron_getty.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2023-12/GettyImages-1834147022.jpg?h=585579a2&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-10/danica_patrick_aaron_rodgers_gettyimages-1002163308.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/aaron-rodgers-gets-candid-about-dating-danica-patrick-were-really-attracted-to-each-other-111884", "title": "Aaron Rodgers Gets Candid About Dating Danica Patrick: 'We're Really Attracted to Each Other'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-10/danica_patrick_aaron_rodgers_gettyimages-1002163308.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The NFL star opens up like never before about his relationship with the iconic race car driver.", "title": "Aaron Rodgers Gets Candid About Dating Danica Patrick", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/aaron-rodgers-gets-candid-about-dating-danica-patrick-were-really-attracted-to-each-other-111884", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The NFL star opens up like never before about his relationship with the iconic race car driver.", "twitter": {"description": "The NFL star opens up like never before about his relationship with the iconic race car driver.", "title": "Aaron Rodgers Gets Candid About Dating Danica Patrick", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/aaron-rodgers-gets-candid-about-dating-danica-patrick-were-really-attracted-to-each-other-111884", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-10/danica_patrick_aaron_rodgers_gettyimages-1002163308.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Aaron Rodgers Gets Candid About Dating Danica Patrick: 'We're Really Attracted to Each Other' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Aaron Rodgers, Danica Patrick, Couples", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
