And he\u2019s already relayed as much to a relieved Lewinsky, whom he ran into at a Hollywood party.\n\n\u201cI told her, \u2018Nobody should tell your story but you, and it\u2019s kind of gross if they do,'\u201d Murphy recalls saying. \u201d \u2018If you want to produce it with me, I would love that; but you should be the producer and you should make all the goddamn money.'\u201d\n\nMeantime, the Crime Story team, which includes Nina Jacobson and Brad Simpson, have been toying with other timely topics in addition to an already in-process installment about Hurricane Katrina. The latter was initially slated to run before the recently concluded season centered on Versace, but it was not ready in time.\n\nWhen it comes to Murphy\u2019s other FX anthologies, he\u2019s currently casting an eighth season of American Horror Story (and, in classic Murphy fashion, reveals he\u2019s \u201cthrowing in Joan Collins\u201d and is \u201cinterested\u201d in Anjelica Huston) and figuring out what the next installment of Feud will be, if not the previously announced Charles and Diana season.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still working on it,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want to do anything unless I\u2019m 100 percent sure.\u201d\n\nA version of this story first appeared in the April 4 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
