USA to be crowned the winner of Miss USA, backtracked on her controversial remarks about health care Tuesday. She now says \"it should be a right\" after previously calling it a privilege.\n\nMiss District of Columbia USA Kara McCullough competes during the Miss USA contest Sunday, May 14, 2017, in Las Vegas.\n\n\"I am privileged to have health care and I do believe that it should be a right,\" the 25-year-old beauty queen said on \"Good Morning America.\" \"I hope and pray moving forward that health care is a right for all worldwide.\"\n\n\"I just want people to see where I was coming from. Having a job, I have to look at health care like it is a privilege.\"\n\nMcCullough, a chemist who works for the government at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, previously said affordable health care was a \"privilege\" during Sunday's question-and-answer rounds.\n\n\"I'm definitely going to say it's a privilege,\" she told host Julianne Hough during the competition. \"As a government employee, I am granted health care and I see firsthand that for one to have health care, you need to have jobs,\" she said at the time. \"So therefore, we need to continue to cultivate this environment that we're given the opportunity to have health care as well as jobs to all the American citizens worldwide.\"\n\n\"I'm definitely going to say it's a privilege.\" Listen to your new #MissUSA talk about healthcare in the USA. pic.twitter.com/CzPBeaTYHO \u2014 Miss USA & Miss Teen USA (@MissUSA) May 15, 2017\n\nThe remark ignited political divides over President Donald Trump and the Republican Party's efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Trump previously co-owned the Miss Universe Organization, which operates the Miss USA pageant.\n\nMcCullough told \"GMA\" Tuesday that she wasn't surprised by online criticisms of her health care comments, or for suggesting she's not a \"feminist\" because she believes women \"are just as equal as men, especially in the workplace.\" She said she prefers the term \"equalism\" to \"feminism.\"\n\n\"I believe that is what America is based on, like having opinions and views,\" she said Tuesday.\n\n\"For me, where I work at with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, 'equalism' is more of a term of understanding that no matter your gender, you are still just kind of given the same accolades on your work,\" McCullough said today. \"I believe that if a person does a good job, they should be, you know, credited for that in a sense.\"\n\nMcCullough, who was born in Italy and raised in Virginia Beach, succeeded 2016 winner DeShauna Barber, also of the District of Columbia. Barber was the first-ever military member to be crowned Miss USA.\n\nMcCullough said she wants to inspire children to pursue careers in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. She graduated with a chemistry degree from South Carolina State University, where she was a member of the Honors College, the American Association of Blacks in Engineering and the Alpha Nu Sigma Honor Society; she also funds program encouraging Science Exploration for Kids.", "images": ["https://www.syracuse.com/pf/resources/images/common/logos/ad-choices-arrow.svg?d=1689",
