Baz Luhrmann had chosen three actors. It was Ewan [McGregor], it was Heath, and me,\u201d he recalled. \u201cWe auditioned with many different actresses, it was a long process. But I never met Heath, I only heard about him. We would be shuffled in and out of rooms. They would literally put me in a room and lock the door and Heath would come in and then Heath would be shuffled through the door. I never saw him.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Deaths: Stars We\u2019ve Lost See all the celebrities that died in 2007, including Chris Cornell, Erin Moran and Greg Allman \u2014 read more\n\nMcGregor was cast for the role, but the failure brought the Oscar-nominated pair together and helped them form a lasting friendship.
