{"url": "https://www.byrdie.com/celebrity-dark-circle-cures", "text": "I'm generally game to try just about anything\u2014from Jennifer Lawrence's favorite facial to waking up earlier each morning in an attempt to be more productive. But when the opportunity to get a facial cupping treatment came up, I got a little timid.\n\n\u200b\u200bCelebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Michael Phelps put cupping, a practice that dates back many centuries throughout Asia and Europe, on the map in the U.S. I'm sure you've seen the pictures of the black-and-blue or red circular marks where each cup was suctioned on their bodies.\n\nSo the idea that I'd be volunteering to pinch, bruise, and suck up the skin on my face was, well, terrifying. Still, in the name of journalism, I showed up for my appointment with Ildi Pekar. And while this facial is nothing like traditional body cupping in practice, it does promise many of the same results. Read on for my facial cupping experience.\n\nMeet the Experts Ildi Pekar is a Hungarian facialist with more than 20 years of experience in organic beauty, lifting facials, and body improvement.\n\nWhat Is Facial Cupping?\n\nPekar's facial cupping treatment utilizes magnetic cups to apply pressure and massage the face, with the goal of improving blood circulation and detoxing the skin via lymphatic circulation. The aim is to deliver a refreshed glow.\n\nCupping is an alternative therapy in which suction cups are placed on different parts of the body, creating little \"vacuums\" that stimulate the skin, muscles, and blood flow. In traditional Chinese medicine, cupping is believed to move stagnant energy and dispel toxins as well as aid in pain management.\n\nThese are the core principles of Pekar's treatment, though she adds a few high-tech touches. \"It's a healing facial that uses a magnetic-cupping technique to increase local chi and blood circulation, and it draws age-defying nutrients to the surface of your face,\" she says. \"Created through stimulating vibrations, this treatment supports microcirculation and has a powerful detox and drainage effect.\" As someone who suffers from prominent (and annoying) under-eye bags and dark circles, the notion of proper drainage and circulation was thrilling.\n\n\"The rhythmic vibrations during this treatment promote movement in your face, allowing toxins to be transported away from the skin,\" Pekar further explains. \"Cell structure is stimulated, which ultimately results in a smoother and slimmer complexion.\" After an intriguing explanation and the reassurance that this would, in fact, be a calming and relaxing experience, I undressed and laid down in the treatment room bed.\n\n\n\nByrdie / Ildi Pekar\n\nWhat to Expect from Facial Cupping\n\nThe 75-minute facial begins with a thorough skin cleansing to create a clean canvas. Pekar then moves on to a gentle enzyme peel meant to exfoliate and even your skin's texture. Then, once the skin is prepped, she focuses on going deeper by utilizing magnetic therapy. According to Pekar, the vibration and massage improve lymphatic circulation and enhance the absorption of topical ingredients. To say this part was relaxing would be an understatement\u2014I was practically sedated.\n\nPekar then moves on to the cupping technique to control movement in your face. This is when she begins to move and drain toxins (and stagnant energy) that accumulates beneath the skin. I immediately felt stimulated and reenergized as, according to Pekar, this technique works to detox quickly and quite deeply. Rather than the intense suction and prickly sensation of the body cupping, this felt like a tiny turkey baster on my skin. A little ticklish, a little suction, but mostly completely soothing.\n\nThe facial finishes with a rhythmic face mask that emits pleasing vibrations all over your face (as well as a hand massage to boot). Truth be told, by the end, I was in paradise. But did it work?\n\n\n\nThe Results\n\nHallie Gould\n\nI got up from the treatment bed and ran to the nearest mirror to inspect my face. I kid you not, I couldn't believe the results. While I expected my skin to look taut, glowy, and more even, I had no idea the treatment would so positively affect my under-eye bags, too.\n\nAs I said earlier, my under-eye bags are a constant struggle for me. I even spoke to a plastic surgeon about my options for treating them. As I looked at my treated skin in the mirror, I noticed those pesky, droopy bags were missing, and in their place was a set of sculpted cheekbones and plump under-eye skin. I could not believe it. No facial had ever given me results so drastic (and I've gotten a lot of facials). I went without concealer for weeks on end, and I've already scheduled my next session with Pekar to keep the results going.\n\nSide Effects\n\nA little redness is to be expected, but otherwise, \"there are no side effects unless the provider isn't trained properly,\" notes Pekar. \"If someone isn't trained, the cups can leave you bruised. That's why we recommend clients seek a pro esthetician's help instead of trying it at home.\" If you do happen to bruise, a little arnica might help.\n\nAftercare\n\nPekar recommends that clients who undergo facial cupping combine it with other therapies to really ramp up the benefits. \"As far as aftercare goes, we love to combine [cupping] with gua sha,\" she says. Gua sha tools are easy to use at home and are meant to help stimulate the detoxification process. \"Cupping detoxes your skin cells, and with gua sha, you can maintain a healthy lymph and blood flow after your service,\" says Pekar. \"That means that you can prevent/treat puffy eyes, work on fine lines, and achieve a youthful, awake, and glowing complexion.\"\n\nThe Final Takeaway\n\nAs Pekar explains, the road to glowy skin is paved with a lot of detoxing\u2014we have to get rid of all the bad stuff to highlight the good. \"Most times, gray and dull skin comes from a lack of circulation and stimulation,\" Pekar says. \"That causes toxin accumulation and stagnation under your skin.\" This facial promises to create a better flow, so Pekar can guide nutrients to the skin's surface, reenergizing and refreshing it while draining the toxins away. And if my results are any indication, it delivers.\n\n", "images": ["https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/aZGyAMz3i_GhPYhmeQSyMKQ76y8=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/byrdie-dieux-auracle-eye-serum-recirc-2d968fa9a8354f04b0405df62646baa8.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/JVK8r3W0x6favwuU1LTWz6B6_GQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/undereye_social-b38ef46c35f44280851064e31701df7b.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/ZDbqpukLRnHiM86FGG-p8ITjWUs=/200x200/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hallie-2-c10888b0350644d7b625adcf133aeb9a.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/VXGiW2ynUhB9qHnkLgVM0Gm9ZZY=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eyecreamstory-b9783998fa4b416195920eb822131e96.png", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/PZnPZfS9vgXtah4_x2gLAyibFT0=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/byr-primary-facial-cleansing-brushes-tstaples-303-be2ed7a551f04e6ca5f54c6a07bdf7bc.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/qzUzpF77ehfOApnCvodx4AKidRE=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/byr-best-under-eye-serum-tout-recirc-d6d175375c7a4beebc400895335d3cfd.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/uc9_wAAVhKGYzQcrZS7qgjwdzyE=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-best-drugstore-setting-powders-tout-b749ade74bb14dd399eac2216bf473a7.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/SZ46p4uFHcQOd74hACUKqu_HNc8=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/byr-best-blackhead-removers-tout-1-recirc-4ce07e99f6e245d898e1a4552d169286.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/xQJU9RAOa-_zRKsxL3qNWmG7YQ0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/facial-cupping-e7a66b07ef0b434483c9217692c55025-01b0c92ac5bf4cd5a461e738e210788c.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/yE4rqgnLslk96swRjrdRh4pmcmU=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/byrdie-best-natural-face-washes-tout-4b870675258740b88ef15a5ce0ef715f.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/dlaLDkfvxQ_MW4j0dEuudfQLFqM=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/DTS_First_Date_Marlen_Stahlhuth_Photos_ID4793copy-51517e60dbb94079a9a077ebd8c43ca8.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/7hlCuwu0E26DBryJd_ED5RdxxEA=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/byr-retinol-eye-creams-tout-48cdd032fe944c469077a051a615009e.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/nHsL7vXMl11TXYA44SW_DslKGuQ=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/byr-best-lip-masks-tout-recirc-9f1c474dd4634210a8841e1079e88dba.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/zFq2b9_MSy2l7MkYdiuhI9ppikI=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/byr-drugstore-night-creams-tested-tout-recirc-c17bfdb442924b5d910e1ca7f95fda48.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/_3Mjirf4KLnEeicEVxI6AoZnzGA=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Stocksy_txp912ceaecCrf300_Medium_4289130-d0f0b0bf53434cac920d7fbefc493962.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/q1ACpSRnvhoWepze7qc92L_aJA4=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/byrdie-best-vitamin-c-serums-recirc-c511d04c1eab469bb191277cdb85560a.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/bd9Q_nmCMSZPhHi0O5iEH7TNdbE=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-best-micellar-water-tout-86a9c713e4e443c386f54fa77e6e1e6d.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/pg96W8sIeWA2K51Pz_Ob7ND2-5U=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-best-eye-creams-tout-Recirc-bf2aeac9de7c4bbe87836832746b23e4.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/6utpNrXg2RsU1S99rXJWKX5hasc=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/prp4-fe2e75dca0a94993a45bd93c652b010c.jpg", "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/w_lBJ8UiSIyT2MPz-BebEgRF3e0=/300x240/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/FE7C107C-8EAF-48AD-9DC1-1BDE8B3327EA-d4c8acd63231490285cf4c7c397182dd.JPG"], "top_img": "https://www.byrdie.com/thmb/JVK8r3W0x6favwuU1LTWz6B6_GQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/undereye_social-b38ef46c35f44280851064e31701df7b.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hallie Gould", "Hallie Gould Is Byrdie'S Editor In Chief.
