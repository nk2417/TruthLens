Some of that hurt is in the shape of an antagonist that I think people will love to see get dealt with.\u201d\n\nTrigger Warnings Will Precede New Episodes\n\nAfter Netflix conducted multiple studies which found the show had a significant cultural impact, igniting tough conversations and causing viewers to take action in regard to its address of serious issues, the streaming giant announced a formatting change for Season 2 which will feature a warning video to air prior to each episode.

I think this season everyone\u2019s looking [for] who to blame, especially the adults.\u201d\n\nSheri Grapples With Guilt\n\nSeason 1 left Sheri in a fragile emotional state as Hannah\u2019s tapes forced her to confront the reality that she took out a stop sign resulting in the death of a classmate, adding to Hannah\u2019s stress as a passenger.
