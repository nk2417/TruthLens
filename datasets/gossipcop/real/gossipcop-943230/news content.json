According to Jimmy Fallon, it\u2019s a lot of hilarious nonsense.\n\nThe \u201cTonight Show\u201d host did his version of \u201cBad Lip Reading\u201d by filling in whispers between Chris Pratt and wife Anna Farris, \u201cAmerican Sniper\u201d star Bradley Cooper and director Clint Eastwood, Benedict Cumberbatch and his wife Sophie Hunter, as well as Eddie Redmayne and Jared Leto.\n\n\u201cYou know what I could really go for? A hot pocket,\u201d Leto says in Fallon\u2019s \u201cCelebrity Whispers\u201d segment that aired on Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cHey, what is this called again?\u201d Eastwood asks Cooper.\n\n\u201cOh, this is a tuxedo. Just a regular tuxedo,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cI don\u2019t like them, though. I feel so proper.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Cumberbatch\u2019s lips matched up perfectly with lyrics to Mark Ronson\u2019s catchy single featuring Bruno Mars, \u201cUptown Funk.\u201d\n\nWatch the video.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/greg.gif?resize=100%2C100&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325_COVER-_IR_5x4.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/greg.gif?fit=58%2C58&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Benedict-Cumberbatch-Celebrity-Whispers-Tonight-Show.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Benedict-Cumberbatch-Celebrity-Whispers-Tonight-Show.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Greg Gilman", "Greg Gilman Is The Singer-Songwriter-Guitarist Of L.A.
