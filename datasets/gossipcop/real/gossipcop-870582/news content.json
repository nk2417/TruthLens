Yay, thank you, mom. I love you.\"\n\nDerringer popped the question to Carrie Ann last December with a stunning Jean Dousset ring on a beach in California.\n\n\n\nWATCH: Carrie Ann Inaba Is Engaged to Robb Derringer After Whirlwind Romance!\n\n\"Saturdays are special to us, because our first date was on a Saturday and we have celebrated with a toast, a visit to a beach, special date, a motorcycle adventure, or a road trip on every Saturday since,\" Carrie Ann told People at the time. \"So on Saturday, we returned to the place of our first date and got engaged at the same place we shared our spontaneous and magical first date.\"\n\nHear more on the proposal in the video below!", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2015-06/640_engagement_rings_split.jpg?width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/1280_et_carrieann_070117.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/1280_et_carrieann_070117.png?width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/1280_et_carrieann_070117.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/222809_carrie_ann_inaba_asks_her_mom_to_be_matron_of_honor_on_live_tv", "title": "Carrie Ann Inaba Asks Her Mom to Be Her Matron of Honor on Live TV -- See the Cute Moment!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/1280_et_carrieann_070117.png", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 'Dancing With the Stars' judge popped the question while co-hosting 'LIVE With Kelly & Ryan' on Tuesday.", "title": "Carrie Ann Inaba Asks Her Mom to Be Her Matron of Honor on Live TV -- See the Cute Moment!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/222809_carrie_ann_inaba_asks_her_mom_to_be_matron_of_honor_on_live_tv", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 'Dancing With the Stars' judge popped the question while co-hosting 'LIVE With Kelly & Ryan' on Tuesday.", "twitter": {"description": "The 'Dancing With the Stars' judge popped the question while co-hosting 'LIVE With Kelly & Ryan' on Tuesday.", "title": "Carrie Ann Inaba Asks Her Mom to Be Her Matron of Honor on Live TV -- See the Cute Moment!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/222809_carrie_ann_inaba_asks_her_mom_to_be_matron_of_honor_on_live_tv", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/1280_et_carrieann_070117.png", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Carrie Ann Inaba Asks Her Mom to Be Her Matron of Honor on Live TV -- See the Cute Moment! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, ,", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
