Jones said he was owed $30 million.\n\nLast week, Jones took the witness stand and claimed he was \u201ccheated out of a lot of money\u201d by the Jackson estate.\n\nDuring the two-week trial, lawyers debated over interpreting the contract language that determined how Jones\u2019 royalties should be computed, particularly the contracts from Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad. Attorneys for Jones argued that those contracts entitled Jones to royalties from the posthumous This is It along with proceeds from the two Cirque du Soleil shows. Meanwhile, Howard Weitzman, who represented the Jackson estate, argued that Jackson made the major contributions to the sound of each song.\n\n\u201cWhile the jury denied Quincy Jones $21 million \u2013 or more than two-thirds of what he demanded \u2014 from The Estate of Michael Jackson, we still believe that giving him millions of dollars that he has no right to receive under his contracts is wrong,\u201d Weitzman and Zia Modabber, attorneys for The Estate of Michael Jackson, said in a statement. \u201cThis would reinterpret the legal language in, and effectively rewrite, contracts that Mr. Jones lived under for more than three decades, admitted he never read, referred to as \u2018contract, montract,\u2019 and told the jurors he didn\u2019t \u2018give a damn\u2019 about. Any amount above and beyond what is called for in his contracts is too much and unfair to Michael\u2019s heirs. Although Mr. Jones is portraying this is a victory for artists\u2019 rights, the real artist is Michael Jackson and it is his money Mr. Jones is seeking.\u201d\n\nFollowing the verdict, Jones said in a statement via Variety, \u201cAs an artist, maintaining the vision and integrity of one\u2019s creation is of paramount importance. I, along with the team I assembled with Michael, took great care and purpose in creating these albums, and it has always given me a great sense of pride and comfort that three decades after they were originally recorded, these songs are still being played in every corner of the world.\n\n\u201cThis lawsuit was never about Michael, it was about protecting the integrity of the work we all did in the recording studio and the legacy of what we created,\u201d he continued. \u201d Although this judgement is not the full amount that I was seeking, I am very grateful that the jury decided in our favor in this matter. I view it not only as a victory for myself personally, but for artists\u2019 rights overall.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-666023238-3072253b-702e-446b-a14c-3919a60ba84e.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-666023238-3072253b-702e-446b-a14c-3919a60ba84e.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Althea Legaspi", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/quincy-jones-awarded-9-42-million-in-royalties-suit-with-michael-jacksons-estate-113207/", "title": "Quincy Jones Awarded $9.42 Million in Royalties Suit", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Quincy Jones has been awarded $9.42 million in his lawsuit over royalties with Michael Jackson's estate.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Althea Legaspi", "tags": "Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Quincy Jones Awarded $9.42 Million in Royalties Suit", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/quincy-jones-awarded-9-42-million-in-royalties-suit-with-michael-jacksons-estate-113207/", "description": "Quincy Jones has been awarded $9.42 million in his lawsuit over royalties with Michael Jackson's estate.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-666023238-3072253b-702e-446b-a14c-3919a60ba84e.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "width": 1600, "height": 900, "alt": "Quincy Jones"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-27T02:10:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T13:59:09+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Quincy Jones has been awarded $9.42 million in his lawsuit over royalties with Michael Jackson's estate.", "site": "@RollingStone", "creator": "@AltheaLegaspi", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Quincy Jones Awarded $9.42 Million in Royalties Suit With Michael Jackson\u2019s Estate", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-666023238-3072253b-702e-446b-a14c-3919a60ba84e.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501121400.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
