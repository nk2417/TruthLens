Stream on\n\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills pal recently sat down with E! News, and was quick to admit that she has her off days when it comes to diet and fitness. \"I've grown up disciplined all my life as a dancer, so I know how to eat and work out. Do I do it? No!\" she said. (Oh, we can relate to that!)\n\nBut, that doesn't mean that every day is cheat day for Erika. The singer shared that she sticks to a \"sensible diet,\" and tries to eat particularly clean when she's in prep mode for a show.\n\nRelated\n\nHere's a typical meal plan for the \"How Many F--ks\" singer:\n\nErika kicks off her day with egg whites, avocado, and grilled tomatoes. When lunchtime rolls around, she'll ususally help herself to \"some kind of chicken.\" But when the dinner bell rings, all bets are off. \"I like to eat,\" the Beverly Hills beauty said. \"I'll eat pasta even though I'm not supposed to.\"\n\nErika also hits the gym regularly, putting in a sweat session three to four days a week. And of course, Erika Jayne's propensity for dance helps keep both ladies' figures in check.\n\nAny health-related information is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
