While Evans, 26, admitted to fans that she and her husband don\u2019t always see eye-to-eye on things, she clarified that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean\u201d they are separating.\n\n\u201cLmfao Married couples have disagreements but that doesn\u2019t mean they are \u2018splitting up.\u2019 #RUMORS,\u201d she wrote alongside an eyeroll emoji.\n\nShe then posted, \u201cMy mom isn\u2019t even friends with me on social media .. why does social media determine someone\u2019s life?\u201d which comes days after Radar reported that Evans unfollowed Eason on Instagram and that the couple aren\u2019t Facebook friends.\n\nJenelle Evans/Instagram\n\nJenelle Evans/Instagram\n\nHours after dispelling the breakup rumors, Evans posted a video of two of her children and Eason, whom she wed in September 2017, at a Christmas tree lot.\n\n\u201cIn the pines, trying to find a #ChristmasTree,\u201d she captioned an Instagram photo of herself and Eason embracing while looking for trees.\n\nEvans\u2019 posts come nearly two months after she placed a 911 call about Eason, alleging that he assaulted her.\n\nPEOPLE confirmed that Evans was hospitalized. The chief of 911 operations for Columbus County, North Carolina, said that two police officers responded to a 911 call placed from the home of Evans and Eason on Oct. 13.\n\nThe call was placed by a female just before 10 p.m. and was \u201ccalled in as an assault,\u201d the chief said. An ambulance was also requested but later canceled, the chief said: \u201cThe female was transported to the hospital via private vehicle instead.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Columbus County Sheriff\u2019s Office told PEOPLE that no incident report was taken.\n\nTMZ later posted audio of Evans\u2019 911 call, when she claimed that Eason injured her collarbone.\n\n\u201cMy husband, he just assaulted me,\u201d Evans told police, sounding distraught. \u201cHe pinned me down on the ground, I\u2019m sorry, in the yard. And I think I heard my f\u2014\u2014 collarbone crack. I can\u2019t move my arm.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jenelle Evans Says She Has PTSD from Road Rage Incident: \u2018He Almost Knocked My Son Out\u2019\n\nA rep for Evans previously told PEOPLE that the MTV star \u201chad friends over Saturday night and they had a bonfire on her property\u201d and \u201cJenelle ended up tripping and falling by the fire.\u201d\n\nIn a statement to E! News, Evans said her 911 call was \u201ca drunk and dramatic misunderstanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything is great. \u2026 We are totally fine,\u201d she said.\n\nThe couple shares daughter Ensley Jolie, almost 2. Evans is also mom to 8-year-old son Jace and 4-year-old son Kaiser, from previous relationships.", "images":
