Trump: \u201cI had more access than most and people had problems with that, people had problems with my 14 year relationship with this president. I\u2019ve always been loyal to him.\" pic.twitter.com/lZF7TTuXzd \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) December 14, 2017\n\nSpeaking with GMA host Michael Strahan, Omarosa disputed the notion she was fired (of course), and insisted that all stories about her dramatic exit come from \u201cone person who... has a personal vendetta against me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had more access than most and people had problems with that,\u201d she said of why her ex-colleagues might have disliked her. \u201cPeople had problems with my 14-year relationship with this president, but I\u2019ve always been loyal to him, straightforward, and I\u2019ve provided him with the support that he\u2019s needed throughout this year.\u201d\n\nDespite that professed loyalty, Manigault-Newman\u2014ever the savvy ex-Apprentice contestant\u2014hinted she plans to write a tell-all on her time with Team Trump.\n\n\u201cAs the only African-American woman in this White House, as a senior staff and assistant to the president, I have seen things that have made me uncomfortable,\u201d she explained, \u201cthat have upset me, that have affected me deeply and emotionally, that has affected my community and people and when I can tell my story, it is a profound story that I know the world will want to hear.\u201d\n\nNot everyone bought Omarosa\u2019s sincerity in seeking to capitalize upon her short-lived White House career.\n\nMoments after the interview ended, a skeptical Robin Roberts said on-air: \u201cShe said she has a story to tell, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be selling that story. Yeah, she will.\u201d And then, referencing an oft-quoted barb from Ice Cube\u2019s Friday movie:", "images": ["https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/fb.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/email-icon.svg?d=342", "https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/1741381130319.png", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/images/obsessed-header-logo-h-2.png?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/7L6PYMCE7RHEBIJZKR23DVTIJI.jpg?smart=true&auth=2558e4fc878237f3ad5bb1aa41ed598bebc770410fe3c21b06f961d190dd7689&width=1440&height=1080", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/thedailybeast/0b112db2-e777-4d41-baed-ef8e8ebff7e9.png", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/XGUQMMBZWBPERAN5L45WL3WKOY.jpg?smart=true&auth=25dd89b7c211cd31955a25c791ae593360e5e45a883efa663ddbad9fa9ddb556&width=1600&height=900", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/google_play.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/twitter-icon.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/reddit.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/Q6VCSZVA2RAGNOY6RHL3JBDX7U.jpg?smart=true&auth=696d13f7ff11f29130823ec818b6cf4c2a2514821a3fc754adf0dd8b4025ae04&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BFH2PPZ3N5AWTJGR4I7VGCQSD4.jpg?smart=true&auth=306b5742d88bb08e4375bb425722a6636b1c6e2e68736060ebab624f8c524c27&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/S6IOCL6AWNEALMWV7LXOFK554I.jpg?smart=true&auth=2ec85d2ed830addf129e6a5e35ab932bce77193647a165fff651d99bea87784b&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/XGUQMMBZWBPERAN5L45WL3WKOY.jpg?smart=true&auth=25dd89b7c211cd31955a25c791ae593360e5e45a883efa663ddbad9fa9ddb556&width=1200&height=630", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/app_store.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/SDEZH4IJYVANHG7SB7OHOLN25Y.png?smart=true&auth=f6c5d3a487876ce737293fc82e0d933b093632d4a0460243076f5ddaaedf4e9a&width=1440&height=1080"], "top_img": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/XGUQMMBZWBPERAN5L45WL3WKOY.jpg?smart=true&auth=25dd89b7c211cd31955a25c791ae593360e5e45a883efa663ddbad9fa9ddb556&width=1200&height=630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Kirell", "Got A Tip", "Send It To The Daily Beast", "Farrah Tomazin", "Julia Ornedo", "Cameron Adams"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/good-morning-america-host-robin-roberts-disses-omarosa-bye-felicia/", "title": "\u2018Good Morning America\u2019 Host Robin Roberts Disses Omarosa: \u2018Bye, Felicia\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "After the ousted White House aide\u2014famed for her shameless loyalty to Trump\u2014claimed she has a \u201cprofound story to tell,\u201d not everyone on ABC\u2019s morning show bought her sincerity.", "twitter": {"description": "After the ousted White House aide\u2014famed for her shameless loyalty to Trump\u2014claimed she has a \u201cprofound story to tell,\u201d not everyone on ABC\u2019s morning show bought her sincerity.", "title": "\u2018Good Morning America\u2019 Disses Omarosa: \u2018Bye, Felicia\u2019", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/XGUQMMBZWBPERAN5L45WL3WKOY.jpg?smart=true&auth=25dd89b7c211cd31955a25c791ae593360e5e45a883efa663ddbad9fa9ddb556&width=1200&height=630", "alt": "171214-omarosa-strahan-tease_yiysih"}, "site": "@https://twitter.com/thedailybeast", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"description": "After the ousted White House aide\u2014famed for her shameless loyalty to Trump\u2014claimed she has a \u201cprofound story to tell,\u201d not everyone on ABC\u2019s morning show bought her sincerity.", "title": "\u2018Good Morning America\u2019 Disses Omarosa: \u2018Bye, Felicia\u2019", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/XGUQMMBZWBPERAN5L45WL3WKOY.jpg?smart=true&auth=25dd89b7c211cd31955a25c791ae593360e5e45a883efa663ddbad9fa9ddb556&width=1200&height=630", "alt": "171214-omarosa-strahan-tease_yiysih"}, "type": "article", "site_name": "The Daily Beast", "url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/good-morning-america-host-robin-roberts-disses-omarosa-bye-felicia/"}, "keywords": "donald-j-trump,good-morning-america", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "loadforge-site-verification": "3ac1d76b00b152231dc1bef253b8d571e663ffa9b4826b38646ee6d4a23225d2a762aac1254120868ebecd9c4666ad563ef03b99a25d3966cba08ee2380aa43b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.thedailybeast.com", "summary": ""}
