Although the singer has not confirmed whether she's singing about herself, many have speculated that the song is about a personal relapse.\n\nIn a new song released Thursday called \u201cSober,\u201d Lovato poignantly sings about reaching a breaking point.\n\n\u201cI got no excuses for all of these goodbyes/ Call me when it\u2019s over \u2018cus I\u2019m dying inside,\u201d Lovato sings. \u201cWake me when the shakes are gone and the cold sweats disappear/ Call me when it\u2019s over and myself has reappeared/ I don\u2019t know why, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know why/ I do it every, every, every time/ It\u2019s only when I\u2019m lonely/ Sometimes I just wanna cave and I don\u2019t wanna fight.\u201d\n\nShe also addresses fans in the song: \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the fans I lost/ Who watched me fall again/ I wanna be a role model/ But I\u2019m only human.\u201d\n\nIn the lyrics at the end of the song, Lovato promises to get help and apologizes.", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/5b2bc8a59ffbab247bcc1ee3/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-960656228.jpg", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self-us/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5b2d29a5ed82452713843645/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/demi-lovato-sober-song.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/5b2d29a5ed82452713843645/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/demi-lovato-sober-song.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Devon Elizabeth"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/demi-lovato-new-song-sober-relapse", "title": "Demi Lovato Sings About Breaking Sobriety in Her Emotional New Song \u2018Sober\u2019", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Devon Elizabeth", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "In her new song \u201cSober,\u201d Demi Lovato sings about relapsing.
