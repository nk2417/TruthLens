Shiloh, 11, wore a black suit with no tie, while Zahara, 13, wore a black top with lace detail and black pants.\n\nThe trio also held hands multiple times on the carpet, and it was clear from their smiles that it was a fun night out for all.\n\nDavid Livingston/Getty images\n\nThe Annie Awards celebrate the best in animation, and the 42-year-old was nominated as a co-proudcer for her film The Breadwinner, which won for Best Animated Feature-Independent.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Jolie has taken her eldest two daughters to an event with her.\n\nLast month, the girls attended the National Board of Review Annual Awards Gala in New York City, where they were also accompanied by Jolie's friend, human rights activist Loung Ung.\n\n\"I'm with a woman I admire very much, and two
