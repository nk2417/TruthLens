But when we saw Kidman\u2019s October 2018 Marie Claire cover, we were a bit shocked. Through no fault of her own, Kidman looks nothing like herself. Is it just us or\u2026?\n\nHer dyed red hair against the cherry red background paired with bright red lips is a lot to take in all at once. But after cutting through the color, it\u2019s still so hard to figure out whose face is gracing the October 2018 issue of Marie Claire. Thankfully, \u201cNicole Kidman\u201d is written in bold white lettering right next to her portrait so we can put two and two together.\n\nAlthough the photo is beautiful and is giving us grunge \u201990s vibes, having so much of Kidman\u2019s face concealed by her new, unrecognizable hair may be to blame for us not registering who the heck it is. Or maybe Photoshop is to blame\u2026\n\nThis cover comes several months after Marie Claire underwent a total rebrand, remarking its territory as a prominent fashion and lifestyle magazine. Prior post-rebrand issues have featured cover models Zendaya, Halsey, and Amy Adams, and each cover shoot has been clean and simple with a vintage flair.\n\nKidman\u2019s cover follows suit, yet it feels confusing compared to those that came before it. Seriously, what is up with this pic?\n\nAnd the rest of the photos from the cover shoot are no better. The red on red on red look could have worked if Kidman\u2019s face wasn\u2019t photoshopped within an inch of its life AND if her hair wasn\u2019t covering her face.\n\nAt least we have this video of Kidman doing the Marie Claire \u201cPop Quiz\u201d to verify that the cover model was actually her and not a stand-in.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn\u2019t the first time that a woman has been heavily photoshopped on the cover of a magazine (remember Kerry Washington on the cover of Adweek?) In fact, at this point in time, such alterations are pretty standard. But why is it that we have to hide perfectly normal body types and features with the likes of photo-editing? I mean, if Marie Claire is trying to rebrand, shouldn\u2019t they pave the way by ignoring what society has deemed \u201cimperfections\u201d?\n\nAs you can imagine, the internet has a lot to say:\n\nShe\u2019s talented actress what do you gain by airbrushing her beyond recognition? An insult to real women. She\u2019s 50.
