The singer left Twitter shortly after the hate and addressed his appearance on Instagram.\n\n\"I came off Twitter Coz [sic] I was always intending to come off Twitter, had nothing to do with what people said about my 'Game of Thrones' cameo, because I am in 'Game of Thrones,' why the here would I worry what people thought about that,\" he wrote. \"It's clearly f---in' awesome.\"\n\nIn an interview with MTV News in 2017, the singer said he thought his character probably wouldn't live long, but he changed his view in his interview with BuzzFeed.\n\n\"I know what 'Game of Thrones' fans hoped happened to my character,\" he said. \"I'm sure they think my character got brutally, brutally murdered, but I think my character is still out there. I think he's chilling.\"\n\n\"Game of Thrones\" will return for its eighth and final season in 2019.\n\nVisit INSIDER's homepage for more.", "images": ["https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5b9a736c2badb95c3851c561?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "https://i.insider.com/5b9a736d2badb95c3851c562?width=700", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5b9a736c2badb95c3851c561?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anjelica Oswald"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-ed-sheeran-cameo-dead-2018-9", "title": "Ed Sheeran thinks that people would've liked his 'Game of Thrones' cameo more if he was killed on the episode", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Ed Sheeran thinks that people would've liked his 'Game of Thrones' cameo more if he was killed on the episode", "datePublished": "2018-09-13T14:57:00.000Z", "dateModified": "2018-09-13T14:57:52.000Z", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Game of Thrones, HBO, TV", "description": "Ed Sheeran made a cameo on the seventh season of \"Game of Thrones.\"\u00a0He recently told BuzzFeed that he thinks his character should have died, but he thinks his character is still alive.", "author": "Anjelica Oswald", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "tbi-vertical": "Entertainment", "og": {"title": "Ed Sheeran thinks that people would've liked his 'Game of Thrones' cameo more if he was killed on the episode", "description": "Ed Sheeran made a cameo on the seventh season of \"Game of Thrones.\"\u00a0He recently told BuzzFeed that he thinks his character should have died, but he thinks his character is still alive.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-ed-sheeran-cameo-dead-2018-9", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/5b9a736c2badb95c3851c561?width=1200&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"psvp": "c"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "5b9a73702badb95c3851c563", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"sections": "Entertainment", "tags": "Page Type:story"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2025-05", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
