{"url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/amas/8473647/tracee-ellis-ross-american-music-awards-host-2018", "text": "Trending on Billboard\n\nIf you thought last year\u2019s American Music Awards were hilarious, you\u2019re in luck: Tracee Ellis Ross is coming back for a second year as the awards show\u2019s host. The black-ish star will return as the night\u2019s emcee as well as an executive producer for the 2018 American Music Awards, which will broadcast live from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Oct. 9.\n\n\u201cSO NICE, I\u2019M DOING IT TWICE,\u201d Ross captioned an Instagram post revealing the news, which reminds fans just how sassy and silly \u2014 and fashionable \u2014 she was on last year\u2019s show.\n\nRoss\u2019 role as host at the 2017 AMAs made the show a family affair, as her mother, Diana Ross, received the lifetime achievement award. Though the same kind of family ties aren\u2019t happening this year, Ross\u2019 hosting gig is still timely: The fifth season of black-ish premieres a week after this year\u2019s American Music Awards on Oct. 16.?\n\nNominations for the 2018 American Music Awards are set to be announced on Sept. 12, with Kane Brown, Ella Mai, Normani and Bebe Rexha unveiling the list live from YouTube Space LA in Los Angeles. The 2018 AMAs air Oct. 9 at 8:00 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\nCheck out Ross\u2019 hosting announcement below.\n\nThey\u2019ve created chart-topping hits with Nelly, The Chainsmokers and the Backstreet Boys, but when it came to Florida Georgia Line\u2018s latest collaboration, it took Tyler Hubbard\u2019s wife to get the track rolling. The country duo feature on Bebe Rexha\u2018s latest single, \u201cMeant to Be,\u201d from her EP All Your Fault: Pt. 2, and the trio shared how the unexpected writing session was fueled from encouraging words of wisdom from Hubbard\u2019s pregnant wife, Hayley.\n\n\u201cIt was my second session of the day and their second session of the day, and they were kind of over it and so was I,\u201d Rexha tells Billboard during an exclusive interview after performing the track at an AMAs encore performance for Xfinity TV subscribers. \u201cTyler and I sat down, and he was like, \u2018You know what my just wife told me? She said, \u2018If it\u2019s meant to be, it\u2019ll be that we write a hit or not.\u2019 And, I said, \u2018Well that\u2019s the song \u2014 let\u2019s go!\u2019 Then the song just poured out.\u201d\n\nHaving worked with everyone from Lil Wayne and 2 Chainz to Martin Garrix and One Direction\u2018s Louis Tomlinson, Rexha prides herself in being a \u201crenegade\u201d with no genre boundaries, so needed little convincing when her manager suggested she explore the country world and \u201cvibe out\u201d with Florida Georgia Line. And, after the duo\u2019s scheduled writing partner pulled out one night, the collaboration was simply \u201cmeant to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were supposed to write with somebody else, and it fell through, and she happened to be available, so it was an unexpected write and a pretty special night,\u201d Hubbard says. \u201cWhen songs like this get written, it\u2019s pretty magical \u2014 everybody feels like we\u2019re onto something big. We all fell in love with it, then Bebe decided she wanted to release it and have us feature, which was a huge honor. One thing lead to another and that\u2019s what\u2019s special thing about this song \u2014 it\u2019s been super organic and nothing\u2019s been forced.\u201d\n\nRexha admits she was incredibly nervous about her first foray into the genre, and held misconceived perceptions about the lyrics and writing style of country artists. Sitting down with Hubbard, she was surprised at how well the pair \u201cbled\u201d into each other\u2019s songwriting styles, and put their twist on each other\u2019s verses.\n\nWhat she didn\u2019t expect was that the feel-good ballad would help her through her own trouble.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve recently been going through heartbreak, and I listen to the song, and it makes me feel better and like there\u2019s some type of destiny and if something doesn\u2019t work out then, there\u2019s something better waiting for you,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s something we need more than ever with all the events going on in the world. People want to feel safe and like everything\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d\n\nThe AMAs encore performance can now be seen exclusively on Xfinity on Demand for Xfinity TV subscribers, along with behind-the-scenes footage of the acts preparing to hit the stage and archival clips of past AMAs.\n\nHaving grown up watching the AMAs with family while calling friends throughout the show to discuss outfits and performances, Rexha was thrilled to perform on the awards show stage.\n\nIt\u2019s a long way from the 28-year-old Brooklyn native\u2019s early days being discovered by Fall Out Boy\u2018s Pete Wentz and joining the bassist\u2019s experimental project, Black Cards, in 2010. She has since penned/co-produced Eminem and Rihanna\u2018s smash \u201cMonster,\u201d and the Selena Gomez hit \u201cLike a Champion,\u201d plus featured on David Guetta\u2018s catchy \u201cMama,\u201d alongside Nicki Minaj, and Tomlinson\u2019s first solo single, \u201cBack to You.\u201d\n\nEach of her collaborators has left their mark on her success and drive.\n\n\u201cNicki taught me to be stronger as a woman and not feel so sorry about wanting things a certain way,\u201d she reflects. \u201cI told her how I watched one of her videos where she was saying how if you accept pickles at video shoots or on your rider, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll get and that\u2019s how people will see you, but if you ask for something nice you\u2019ll get something nicer! That really resonated with me \u2014 not just in that sense \u2014 but in terms of knowing how I want things done and being very clear in my vision.\n\n\u201cSometimes when I walk into a room, especially with males, it\u2019s very startling because I know exactly how to work the pro-tools, cut my vocals, design my outfits, do fonts. I\u2019m very hands-on, and she taught me to stick to that intuition and embrace it, instead of being scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen working with Louis Tomlinson was just so humbling,\u201d she adds of the teen heartthrob. \u201cIt\u2019s so different for guys! As girls, we get stressed over our image and insecure about our weight, whereas a guy wakes up in the morning, showers and throws his clothes on. What I loved about him was he was so humble, and it was actually startling because I\u2019ve met people who haven\u2019t been near the level of fame that Louis has experienced, yet he was one of the most humble people I\u2019ve met, and it was so nice to be around that.\u201d\n\nWhile Rexha has loved and learned from all of her collaborations, her next project, titled Expectations and dropping in 2018, will be focused more on her own voice.\n\nHowever, one thing fans can expect from Expectations is the unexpected.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely changing up the sound,\u201d she shares. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going into more of a rhythmic vibe and urban sound, especially female artists, but I\u2019m going the complete opposite way. It\u2019s very guitar-based and inspired by my favorite bands I grew up listening to, like No Doubt, and I\u2019m not holding anything back.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cool that \u2018Meant to Be\u2019 is this stripped-back song because I think it\u2019ll help me pivot into that sound. And, the overall meaning of Expectations is just growing up in a world where I expected my parents to be superheros or my career and money to bring me happiness, but realizing as you get older that you have to be the creator of your own happiness. The things you thought might be are not.\u201d\n\nBebe Rexha and Florida Geogia Line\u2019s encore performance of \u201cMeant to Be\u201d will be available exclusively on Xfinity on Demand for Xfinity TV subscribers immediately following the show\u2019s live television broadcast. Behind-the-scenes footage of the acts preparing to hit the stage and archival clips from past AMAs will also be available to Xfinity TV customers.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Tracee-Ellis-Ross-2017-AMAs-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=628&crop=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Tracee-Ellis-Ross-2017-AMAs-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/amas-recirc-2018-billboard.jpg", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Tracee-Ellis-Ross-2017-AMAs-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Taylor Weatherby", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/tracee-ellis-ross-american-music-awards-host-2018-8473647/", "title": "Tracee Ellis Ross to Return as American Music Awards Host", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The black-ish star will return as the night's emcee as well as an executive producer for the 2018 American Music Awards, which will broadcast live from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Oct.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Taylor Weatherby", "tags": "ama, bbnews, Tracee Ellis Ross", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Tracee Ellis Ross to Return as American Music Awards Host", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/tracee-ellis-ross-american-music-awards-host-2018-8473647/", "description": "The black-ish star will return as the night's emcee as well as an executive producer for the 2018 American Music Awards, which will broadcast live from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Oct. 9.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Tracee-Ellis-Ross-2017-AMAs-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Tracee Ellis Ross"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-09-05T14:13:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-02-07T22:55:44+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The black-ish star will return as the night's emcee as well as an executive producer for the 2018 American Music Awards, which will broadcast live from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Oct. 9.", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Tracee Ellis Ross to Return as American Music Awards Host", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Tracee-Ellis-Ross-2017-AMAs-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1536156829.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
