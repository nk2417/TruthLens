The girl gang movie will be based on the \u201cBirds of Prey\u201d comic, with Margot Robbie attached to star.\n\nRobbie\u2019s LuckyChap is producing with Sue Kroll and her Kroll & Co Entertainment, along with Bryan Unkeless of Clubhouse Pictures.\n\nYan, a former Wall St. Journal reporter who made her feature debut with Sundance entry \u201cDead Pigs,\u201d will be the second female filmmaker to direct a DC film, following Patty Jenkins with \u201cWonder Woman.\u201d She will also be the first Asian woman to helm a movie from the DC Comics universe. DC previously tapped Ava DuVernay to direct \u201cNew Gods,\u201d which is still in development.\n\nChristina Hodson, who was recently tapped to pen the \u201cBatgirl\u201d pic, wrote the script. The studio had been weighing several Quinn options, including a \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d sequel with Gavin O\u2019Connor, before picking \u201cBirds of Prey.\u201d Sources add that script is still being worked on, but Yan is likely to take over directing reins once the script is done.\n\nProduction is expected to start at the end of the year after Robbie finishes shooting Quentin Tarantino\u2019s \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood,\u201d for which she is currently in negotiations to play Sharon Tate.\n\nThe sequel to the Harley Quinn-starring \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d is also expected to begin production in 2018. Gavin O\u2019Connor is on board to write the sequel and is also in talks to direct the film that co-stars Will Smith and Jared Leto.\n\nYan is repped by CAA. Deadline Hollywood first reported the news.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/suicide-squad-harley-quinn.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/suicide-squad-harley-quinn.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Justin Kroll", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/cathy-yan-harley-quinn-movie-margot-robbie-1202755503/", "title": "Cathy Yan to Direct Harley Quinn Spinoff Starring Margot Robbie", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Cathy Yan has been tapped to direct the next Harley Quinn movie based on the \"Birds of Prey\" comic with Margot Robbie attached to star.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Justin Kroll", "tags": "Cathy Yan, Harley Quinn, Margot Robbie", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Cathy Yan to Direct Harley Quinn Spinoff Starring Margot Robbie", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/cathy-yan-harley-quinn-movie-margot-robbie-1202755503/", "description": "Cathy Yan has been tapped to direct the next Harley Quinn movie based on the \"Birds of Prey\" comic with Margot Robbie attached to star.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/suicide-squad-harley-quinn.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Suicide Squad Harley Quinn"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-17T15:22:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-17T19:32:15+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cathy Yan has been tapped to direct the next Harley Quinn movie based on the \"Birds of Prey\" comic with Margot Robbie attached to star.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@krolljvar", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cathy Yan to Direct Harley Quinn Spinoff Starring Margot Robbie", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/suicide-squad-harley-quinn.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523978577.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
