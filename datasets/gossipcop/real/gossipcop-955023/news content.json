Upon moving to New York City, she attended the Professional Performing Arts School.[10][11][12]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nActing [ edit ]\n\nMomsen at the Metropolitan Opera in 2008\n\nShe began acting professionally at three years of age in a 1997 national commercial for Shake 'n Bake.[13] She was then cast in The Prophet's Game.\n\nIn 2000, Momsen played the role of Cindy Lou Who in Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas, her breakout role. In 2002, she played Gretel in Hansel and Gretel and Alexandra, the President's daughter, in Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams.\n\nMomsen's career came to a halt for over three years until she received a lead role in the WB series Misconceptions, which never aired. After that, she appeared in the 2006 film Saving Shiloh. She also auditioned for the title role in Hannah Montana, and was in the top three, but the role was instead awarded to Miley Cyrus\u2014a decision that Momsen was happy with in retrospect.[14] In 2007, she starred in the Walt Disney Pictures film Underdog as Molly and as Jennifer in the movie Paranoid Park, directed by Gus Van Sant.\n\nBeginning in 2007, she played the character of Jenny Humphrey in The CW television series Gossip Girl, based on the book series by Cecily von Ziegesar. Momsen's appearances on the series became increasingly sporadic, and, by the end of the first half of the fourth season, she had only appeared in four episodes. It was then announced that the actress would be scheduled for an indefinite hiatus from the show,[15] which ended with her leaving the series as a regular cast member after the completion of the fourth season in 2011. On August 16, 2011, Momsen told Elle magazine that she had quit acting to focus on her music career.[16] On October 16, 2012, it was reported that Momsen would be returning to Gossip Girl for its final episode, in which she appeared briefly in the wedding sequence.[17][18]\n\nReflecting on her child acting career, she described it as an \"alienating\" experience, detailing bullying she received after her performance in How the Grinch Stole Christmas.[19]\n\nModeling [ edit ]\n\nMomsen was signed with Ford Models at a very young age: \"My parents signed me up with Ford [Modeling] at the age of two. No two-year-old wants to be working, but I had no choice. My whole life, I was in and out of school. I didn't have friends. I was working constantly and I didn't have a real life.\"[7]\n\nIn June 2008, at the age of 14, Momsen signed to IMG Models.[20][21] She was the face of British fashion chain New Look for its spring/summer 2010 collection.[22] After weeks of speculation about who would be the face of Madonna's 2010 fashion line \"Material Girl\", Momsen was announced on July 15, 2010.[23] A week later, Momsen was announced as the model for John Galliano's new women's fragrance, scheduled to launch in autumn 2010.[24] In 2010, she appeared in a video for Galliano's \"Parlez-Moi d'Amour\" fragrance ad campaign.\n\nMomsen is the face of Samantha Thavasa's handbag line.

She appeared on the cover of FHM's March 2012 edition[27] and FHM ranked Momsen #29 in its 2012 Hot 100 issue.[28] She also made her cover debut for Maxim in the November 2013 issue.[29]\n\nIn an interview with music journalist Jason Tanamor, when asked about posing for Playboy, she said, \"I was at the mansion last week and took some pictures. Does that count?\"[30]\n\nMusic [ edit ]\n\nMomsen performing in April 2010\n\nMomsen has said that \"music is where I can be me\",[31] stating that \"acting is easy. I've been doing it for so long and I totally love it. But you're playing a character instead of yourself. Music is more personal because you're writing it and you're involved in every step of it.\"[31] At seven years old, Momsen recorded the song \"Where Are You Christmas?\" for the soundtrack to How the Grinch Stole Christmas. In 2002, she recorded the songs \"One Small Voice\" and \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" for the compilation album School's Out! Christmas.\n\nIn March 2009, Momsen stated in an interview with OK! magazine that her band the Pretty Reckless had signed a deal with Interscope Records.[32] She played her first tour with her band opening for The Veronicas on their Revenge Is Sweeter Tour in spring 2009.[33] After the tour, Momsen began working with guitarist Ben Phillips, who would soon join the band. Momsen subsequently swapped out her former bandmates. She co-writes songs with Phillips; in addition to lead vocals, Momsen also plays rhythm guitar.\n\nThe band's debut album Light Me Up was released on August 30, 2010, in the UK,[34] where it debuted at number 6, as well as at number 18 in Ireland.

Songs from this album have featured in the movie Kick-Ass as well as the television series The Vampire Diaries and Gossip Girl.[35]\n\nTelevision personality Heidi Montag recorded \"Blackout\", a song written by Momsen. According to Momsen, she wrote the song when she was 8 years old and recorded it as a demo with a producer.[36] Montag released the song as a digital only single, with the music video being directed by her husband Spencer Pratt. Momsen commented about the recording: \"I'm like, okay, dude, you're singing an 8-year-old's words, but that's cool. It's so funny because I didn't shop it or anything and I get this call going, 'Did you write a song for Heidi Montag'? And I'm like, 'What?'\"[36] The track was later included on Montag's debut studio album, Superficial (2010).\n\nOn July 27, 2011, Momsen announced that the band would be the supporting act for Evanescence during the fall of 2011.[37] Throughout 2012, Momsen and her band toured North America; the second headlining tour, titled the Medicine Tour, began in March 2012[38] and culminated with supporting dates for Marilyn Manson's 2012 world tour Hey Cruel World...

In 2014, her band also supported Fall Out Boy in their European leg of the Save Rock n Roll Tour along with New Politics.\n\nThroughout 2015, Momsen continued to record new material for the third Pretty Reckless album. On September 29, 2016, the band released the single \"Take Me Down\", which reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart.[46][47] The third album, Who You Selling For, was released in October 2016.[46]\n\nIn 2020, Momsen lent her vocals to the American rock band Evanescence for \"Use My Voice\", a single from the band's album The Bitter Truth, alongside other artists such as American rock vocalist Lzzy Hale from Halestorm, Dutch symphonic metal vocalist Sharon den Adel from Within Temptation, and electronic violinist Lindsey Stirling.[48]\n\nThe Pretty Reckless released their fourth album, Death by Rock and Roll, on February 12, 2021.
