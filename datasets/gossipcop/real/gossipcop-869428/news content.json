His excuse? It would just be too easy to have sex with them.\n\nHe said:\n\nYou know, I never did it because I always thought, like, I would end up fucking a female rapper and fucking the business up\u2026 I\u2019m so focused on my business. I just, I gotta be honest with you. You know, she looking good. I\u2019m spending so much money on her photo shoots. I gotta fuck a couple times.\n\nIt is unfortunately not surprising that a label exec like Ross would expect sex from the artists he signs (or, in this case, doesn\u2019t sign), especially now when the longstanding misogyny of powerful men in music is becoming more transparent in cases like Dr. Luke, R. Kelly or LA Reid. But Ross\u2019s comments about spending so much money on photo shoots for female artists are particularly interesting.\n\nThe number of female rappers signed to major labels has been steadily dropping since the 1980s. When NPR interviewed MC Lyte\u2014the first woman with a solo rap record on a major label\u2014about this topic in 2014, one of the reasons she offered for the decline was the fact that signing women is risky because of the costs that add up concerning their looks: hair, makeup, photo-shoots.\n\nAnd this has long been the excuse. \u201cThat\u2019s why labels only release a new female MC every few years,\u201d former Vibe editor-in-chief Mimi Valdes said in 2007. \u201cThey\u2019re just too damn expensive!\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen are viewed differently because we cost more money, number one,\u201d Nicki Minaj\u2019s former manager Debra Antney told Vice in 2014. \u201cA guy could look like Cyclopes\u2019 twin and get up there and make it. He just throws on a T-shirt and some jeans and he\u2019s fly. For us, it\u2019s the whole glam squad\u2014the hair, the makeup\u2014all these things that you have to have.\u201d\n\nThe whole thing just seems like a snake eating its own tail: you have to be professionally gorgeous to be a successful rapper, but then your gorgeousness apparently makes your male bosses want to have sex with you, and then that\u2019s bad for your career. Seems like a good way around this would be to see women rappers as actual artists with agency?", "images": ["https://img.pastemagazine.com/wp-content/juploads/2025/10/bari151.jpg",
