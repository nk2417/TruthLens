After he is surprised to see her on campus, she serves the best response to him refusing to believe she got accepted.\n\n\u201cWhat, like it\u2019s hard?\u201d\n\nStarting a movement\n\nWe will never forget when Elle taught Paulette about the \u201cBend and Snap,\u201d which people are still quoting, and practicing in their regular lives so many years later\u2026 thankfully with not too many broken noses.\n\nFashion statements\n\n\u201cWhoever said orange is the new pink was seriously disturbed.\u201d\n\nA quote still relevant nowadays.\n\nA Flawless Defense\n\nIt took her some time to get her groove in the courtroom, but Elle knew immediately Brooke Taylor-Windham was innocent because of her work as a fitness guru.\n\n\u201cExercise gives you endorphins. Endorphins make you happy. Happy people just don\u2019t shoot their husbands, they just don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe Perfect Comeback\n\nWe all hated Vivian Kensington after she tried to bully Elle by finally inviting her to a college party, only to lie to her and saying it was a costume party.\n\nRather than feeling humiliated after being the only one dressed up, Elle kept her head held high and served up one of the greatest comebacks in history.\n\n\u201cOh, I like your outfit too, except when I dress up as a frigid b\u2014, I try not to look so constipated.\u201d\n\nIt took Vivian a few weeks to recover, off camera of course.\n\nWho doesn\u2019t quote this?\n\nAfter she is shocked by Warner introducing her to his new fiancee Vivian, and showing off her giant engagement ring, Elle served up another great one-liner that has become a staple phrase in the English language.\n\n\u201cUh. I\u2019m sorry. I just hallucinated.\u201d\n\nIconic Ice Breaker\n\nYou wish your intro during your college orientation ice-breaker was this legendary.\n\n\u201cHi. I\u2019m Elle Woods and this is Bruise Woods. We\u2019re both Gemini vegetarians.\u201d\n\nBye Bye Warner\n\nAfter Elle shocks everyone by winning the court case, Warner comes crawling back to her side, but knowing she deserves better (Hi, Luke Wilson) than someone who left her behind, she rejects him by using his own words agains\u2019t him, but better.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019m going to be a partner in a law firm by the time I\u2019m 30, I\u2019m going to need a boyfriend who\u2019s not such a bonehead.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s Not Forget the Sequel\n\nLegally Blonde 2: Red, White & Blonde was not as iconic as its predecessor, but it certainly had legendary one-liners we will never forget.\n\nIn a landmark moment, Elle and Stan find out their dogs are the first on-screen same-sex dog couple with an iconic line by the doggy day care attendant.\n\n\u201cYour dogs are gay.\u201d\n\nWill Legally Blonde 3 see Elle Woods on her way to the White House? No plot details have been revealed so far but if the final moments from the sequel are any indication we might be visiting the West Wing with Reese Witherspoon in 2020.", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/70afec6a-3143-4947-b047-428e525611d4.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jose Bastidas", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/movies/news/unforgettable-legally-blonde-quotes-honor-third-film/", "title": "9 Unforgettable \u2018Legally Blonde\u2019 Quotes in Honor of Third Film", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "9 Unforgettable 'Legally Blonde' Quotes in Honor of Third Film", "description": "The countdown is on for Legally Blonde 3, set to premiere in theaters on Valentine\u2019s Day 2020 and bring Elle Woods back into our lives for another adventure.
