It\u2019s too far away from his kids.\u201d With regard to Lopez, the source added, \u201cThe house is way too big for her.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no denying it\u2019s big. The 12-bed, 24-bathroom home sits on a 5.2-acre lot, and it includes such amenities as basketball and pickleball courts, a fully equipped gym, a boxing ring, a 12-car garage, a zero-edge pool, a guest penthouse, and more.\n\nThis news arrives amid murmurs about the couple\u2019s separation, which started spreading in the spring, when it was reported that Affleck had not been living in his and Lopez\u2019s shared home. The reports were exacerbated when the Air director and star was spotted out and about without his wedding ring on.\n\nSince then, the couple has been spotted on a number of outings, including a family movie viewing with Jennifer Garner, as well as a graduation for Affleck\u2019s son, Samuel. Insiders have claimed the two are \u201ctaking space\u201d from each other after \u201cmonths\u201d of working through issues, and they\u2019ve been struggling due to their very different \u201capproaches to fame.\u201d\n\nDespite all this, the two clearly still care for one another. Last month, J.Lo shared a Father\u2019s Day post that featured a throwback shot of Affleck, and underneath it, she wrote, \u201cOur hero \ud83e\udd0d Happy Father\u2019s Day.\u201d Meanwhile, Affleck has been spotted making various visits to their Beverly Hills home.\n\n\n\nThe couple known as Bennifer first bought the house in 2023 for $60.8 million, after almost two years of searching for the perfect home. According to the Zillow listing, the home has undergone some significant renovations, which is why the price tag has gone up.
