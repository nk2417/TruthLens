Stephanie Tanner (Jodie Sweetin) surprised fans \u2013 and her sister D.J. Tanner (Candace Cameron Bure) \u2013 during the eighth episode of Fuller House season 4. While attending an awards ceremony, Stephanie comments that the winner of Best Veterinarian\u2019s Clinic \u201cwas only open for three weeks,\u201d before adding, \u201cI had a girlfriend longer than that.\u201d\n\nHer sister is completely shocked. \u201cWait, what?\u201d she says while Gia (Marla Sokoloff) cannot stop laughing. Soon after, Sweetin, 36, also starts giggling. The laughing was actually real, too \u2013 neither Sokoloff nor Bure were told about the line ahead of time.\n\nRelated: LGBTQ Characters on TV LGBTQ representation on television has evolved every year since 1997 when Ellen DeGeneres became the first mainstream character to proclaim the words \u201cI\u2019m gay\u201d on her sitcom, Ellen. Since then, more LGBTQ characters have graced the small screen \u2014 even receiving Emmy recognition for their storylines. Will & Grace introduced neurotic lawyer Will Truman to [\u2026]\n\n\u201cJodie switched up the line in that take and we weren\u2019t expecting it, so it was everyone\u2019s true reaction and we broke,\u201d Bure, 42, wrote on Twitter on December 15. \u201cSo they kept it in.\u201d\n\nThe moment received a ton of attention on social media. \u201cSTEPHANIE TANNER IS BISEXUAL I LOVE THAT,\u201d one user wrote. Another added, \u201cStephanie Tanner came out as bisexual on Fuller House and I am LIVING for it.\u201d\n\nHowever, not everyone was thrilled with the \u201cbisexual\u201d title, with one fan writing, \u201cI don\u2019t think having one girlfriend makes you 100% bisexual.\u201d\n\nRelated: Full House Cast: Then and Now You got it, dude! America fell in love with the Tanner family in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and fans celebrated when news broke that the cast would be reuniting for Netflix's Fuller House -- see then-and-now photos!\n\nAt the end of season 4, Stephanie became a mother. After revealing she couldn\u2019t have children in a previous story line, Kimmy (Andrea Barber) offered to be a surrogate for her longtime neighbor.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be really fun for fans to see what Stephanie\u2019s like as a parent,\u201d Sweetin, who has two children of her own, told the Today show on December 14. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s going to be great to have that interaction of D.J. and her parenting style, Steph and her parenting style and Kimmy and hers. I think it\u2019s gonna be a really fun dynamic for the three women in the house with all the kids.\u201d\n\nAs for what kind of mother she\u2019ll be, Sweetin noted that it won\u2019t be what anyone is expecting.\n\nRelated: Fictional TV Hometowns If only it really existed! Sometimes a TV show's setting becomes just another character. Check out some of our favorite small screen fictional hometowns, including Dawson's Creek's Capeside, Gilmore Girls' Stars Hollow, and more!\n\n\u201cI think she might be a little more uptight and nervous than anybody thinks she\u2019s going to be. But I think that she\u2019s definitely going to be different than D.J. and Kimmy,\u201d the Entertaining Christmas star said. \u201cI think she\u2019s not going to be kind of as crazy and wild, and wanting the approval like Kimmy does. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s going to be quite as uptight as D.J. is, and rigid. I think she\u2019s going to have a lot of fun being a mom. But if I had to pick one person that she\u2019s gonna be like, it\u2019ll probably be Uncle Jesse (John Stamos). I think she and Jesse have a lot of similarities.\u201d\n\nFuller House is now streaming on Netflix.", "images":
