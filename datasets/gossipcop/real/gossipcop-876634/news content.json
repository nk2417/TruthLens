Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nElizabeth Penniman, vice president of communications at the Red Cross' national headquarters, called it \"an incredible gift.\"\n\n\"Especially during times of disaster, people see what\u2019s happening in Texas and our hearts all go out to them,\u201d Penniman told People. \u201cHaving someone like Sandra Bullock make this kind of commitment, it helps bring people together and open their hearts and be even more generous.\u201d\n\nThe gift is a step up even from generous celebrity donations. Jumanji co-stars Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson have led a star-stuffed challenge to give to the Red Cross. (Hart is at $50K.) Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez each donated $25,000.", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gciaf/prod/p?a=pageview&p=USAT-TEALIUM-TANGENT&m=web&k=f14ebdd6-0569-4c64-af73-99937bc06379&s=noscript", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/d5b99f3ad23e56fc75759fd4ae2cd796bd93e213/c=0-178-3500-2155/local/-/media/2017/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/636396358863124149-AP-PEOPLE-SANDRA-BULLOCK-88789300.JPG?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/d5b99f3ad23e56fc75759fd4ae2cd796bd93e213/c=0-178-3500-2155/local/-/media/2017/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/636396358863124149-AP-PEOPLE-SANDRA-BULLOCK-88789300.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/660ea1e0bd7e6049e3ea4dba28cac038717f1f2b/c=67-18-565-516/local/-/media/2019/03/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636880824691829556-bryan-alexander.jpg?width=48&height=48&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/d5b99f3ad23e56fc75759fd4ae2cd796bd93e213/c=0-178-3500-2155/local/-/media/2017/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/636396358863124149-AP-PEOPLE-SANDRA-BULLOCK-88789300.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/08/29/sandra-bullock-donates-1-million-harvey-red-cross-relief/614894001/", "title": "Sandra Bullock donates $1 million to Harvey Red Cross relief", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Sandra Bullock donates $1 million to Harvey Red Cross relief", "description": "The actress, who has a home in Texas, gives the Red Cross a needed $1 million check saying, \u201cWe all have to do our part.\u201d", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/08/29/sandra-bullock-donates-1-million-harvey-red-cross-relief/614894001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/d5b99f3ad23e56fc75759fd4ae2cd796bd93e213/c=0-178-3500-2155/local/-/media/2017/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/636396358863124149-AP-PEOPLE-SANDRA-BULLOCK-88789300.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1808}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Bryan Alexander", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The actress, who has a home in Texas, gives the Red Cross a needed $1 million check saying, \u201cWe all have to do our part.\u201d", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 1279862243338849}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/d5b99f3ad23e56fc75759fd4ae2cd796bd93e213/c=0-178-3500-2155/local/-/media/2017/08/29/USATODAY/USATODAY/636396358863124149-AP-PEOPLE-SANDRA-BULLOCK-88789300.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Sandra Bullock donates $1 million to Harvey Red Cross relief", "description": "The actress, who has a home in Texas, gives the Red Cross a needed $1 million check saying, \u201cWe all have to do our part.\u201d"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503979200.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
