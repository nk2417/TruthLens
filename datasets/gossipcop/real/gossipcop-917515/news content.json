The moment of truth,\u201d Geno says. \u201cThis has been a long week, and she actually stayed in the chair longer than I thought she would. I mean, just get the patch off and see what the doctor\u2019s got to say. If she can\u2019t see and it\u2019s bad news, I don\u2019t know what the f\u2014 she\u2019s gonna say or do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to even think about me going completely blind,\u201d Mama June then says. \u201cWho\u2019s going to take care of my girls, my house? I\u2019m not gonna be able to see Pumpkin\u2019s baby [or] Alana. It\u2019s gonna be awful.\u201d\n\nWe eventually see June sitting in the optometrist\u2019s chair as the doctor carefully and compassionately provides her with realistic expectations for the future.\n\n\u201cYou know, we actually don\u2019t expect you to see a lot today because the eye has been through a lot,\u201d the doctor says. \u201cWe expect things to be very blurry and we\u2019re not sure how good your vision\u2019s gonna get.\u201d\n\nAfter the eye-patch she has been wearing is removed, one of the shows producers asks June, \u201cWhat can you see, June? What is it like?\u201d\n\nJune breaks down in tears and Geno says to her, \u201cCan you see me? If you can\u2019t see, there\u2019s still things they can do.\u201d\n\nThe clip ends there, leaving fans needing to see the full episode in order to find out how it ends.\n\nMama June recently lost 300 pounds, and picked up a new man, Geno, who she says is her \u201crock\u201d and \u201cbest friend.\u201d\n\nIn an interview from January, Mama June (real name June Shannon), said, \u201cHe\u2019s my rock and my best friend. We\u2019re together 24 hours a day. I mean it\u2019s kind of weird that we don\u2019t really have to do anything.\u201c\n\n\u201cWe can just chill at the house, or chill with the kids, or just go to the store. I\u2019ve never been able to enjoy somebody as much as I have him,\u201d she continued, as reported by Page Six.\n\nShannon also added that Geno \u201chad no idea who I was\u201d when they first met, but, coincidentally, his kids did. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I like about it. We grew up in the same town but didn\u2019t know one another. He doesn\u2019t care about me being famous, or anything about it. He\u2019s having fun with it,\u201d Shannon said.", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/04/45511bc5-8791-4d0b-a2e9-34e9c9011b24.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/70afec6a-3143-4947-b047-428e525611d4.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephen G.", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/news/mama-june-break-down-learning-if-blind/", "title": "Watch Mama June Break Down After Learning If She\u2019s Blind", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Watch Mama June Break Down After Learning If She's Blind", "description": "In a clip from an upcoming episode of Mama June: From Not to Hot, Mama June breaks down after learning if she\u2019s blind.
