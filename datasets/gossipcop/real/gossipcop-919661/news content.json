The Vanderpump Rules pal's marriage to Mike Shay ended in divorce; shortly thereafter, her romantic relationship with longtime friend Rob Valletta was also put on ice. If breaking up is hard to do, then breaking up twice is even harder \u2014 and Scheana recently opened up about that in a major way.\n\nHow to Watch Vanderpump Rules Season 12 premieres on Tuesday, December 2 at 9/8c on Bravo and streams next day on Peacock. Watch \u00e2Raise Your Glass to 11 Seasons\u00e2 special on Tuesday, November 25 at 9/8c on Bravo. Stream on\n\nSpeaking to Us Weekly, the SURver admitted that she cringes at certain scenes from Vanderpump Rules Season 6. (Hint: She talked about Rob. A lot. Peep the clip above if you need proof.) \"Just seeing where I was last year and how I obsessed I was with my relationship and all of that and coming into this year, I feel like I\u2019m much more self-aware, self-deprecating, and I feel like I\u2019m me again for the first time in a while\u2026 I kind of lost myself for a couple years and got caught up in the things that weren\u2019t important,\" she shared.\n\nScheana also reflected on prior seasons, which showcased the tough spots in her marriage. \"I think season 4, it got really hard just dealing with Shay\u2019s addiction and martial problems and season 5, pretending like everything was fine. I felt like I wasn\u2019t really being my true self, I was putting on this facade of \u2018everything\u2019s sunshine and rainbows and no, no, no, I\u2019m really happy,\" she shared.\n\nSheana added, \"Even with Rob, there was so many times that things didn\u2019t really [seem] right, but I ignored it. I ignored signs, I ignored other opinions. I was just like \u2018No, no, no, this is perfect,\u2019 because I couldn\u2019t admit that me jumping into a relationship a month after a divorce was a bad idea. I couldn\u2019t admit that things weren\u2019t perfect. I just wanted everyone to think, \u2018Oh wow, this is her fairy-tale ending, she got divorced and met the love of her life. And everyone lived happily ever after.\u2019 And that was not the case.\"\n\nBut the SURver has different plans for Season 7 (premieres Dec. 3 9/8 c.) \"I think this year, I\u2019ve done a really good job at being as honest as I possibly can be and vulnerable. If I\u2019m sad, you\u2019re going to see me cry. If I\u2019m angry, you\u2019re going to hear what I have to say,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I held back for a long time and kind of tiptoed around certain people. I didn\u2019t want to upset people. I wanted everyone to think that my life was perfect when it certainly wasn\u2019t.\"\n\nShe's also focusing more on her friendships. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing I think Stassi, Kristen, and Katie love about me is they\u2019re like, \u2018We can make fun of you and you\u2019re not going to get your feelings hurt now?'\u2026 I think that will be fun to see me not getting so butthurt about things that don\u2019t matter.\" Get a sneak peek at the new season, below.", "images":
