Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.\n\nAt such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.\n\nThe Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.", "images": ["https://www.independent.co.uk/img/logo-white-out.svg", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/27/11/gettyimages-498509206.jpg", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/27/11/gettyimages-498509206.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/27/11/gettyimages-498509206.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/rita-ora-beyonce-lemonade-rumours-jay-z-affair-who-is-becky-a7003171.html", "title": "Rita Ora responds to 'false' Jay Z affair rumours after Beyonc\u00e9 Lemonade lyric", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "People", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/news/people", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "Some Beyonc\u00e9\u00a0\u00a0fans chose to target Ora after initially targeting Rachel Roy", "og": {"updated_time": "2016-04-27T16:11:09.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Rita Ora responds to rumours she's 'Becky with the good hair'", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/rita-ora-beyonce-lemonade-rumours-jay-z-affair-who-is-becky-a7003171.html", "type": "article", "description": "Some Beyonc\u00e9\u00a0\u00a0fans chose to target Ora after initially targeting Rachel Roy", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/27/11/gettyimages-498509206.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/27/11/gettyimages-498509206.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-27T16:11:09.000Z", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T16:11:09.000Z", "section": "News", "subsection": "People", "author_name": "Olivia Blair", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 341, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 3, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 3}, "date": "2016-04-27T16:11:09.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Rita Ora responds to rumours she's 'Becky with the good hair'", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Some Beyonc\u00e9\u00a0\u00a0fans chose to target Ora after initially targeting Rachel Roy", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/27/11/gettyimages-498509206.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Beyonce\",\"Rita Ora\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1461773469.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
