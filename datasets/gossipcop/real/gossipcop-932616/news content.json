Uma Thurman says she is open to working with Quentin Tarantino again if he wrote \u201ca good part\u201d for her.\n\nUma Thurman has said she always shared a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with filmmaker Quentin Tarantino and is open to working with him once again if he wrote \u201ca good part\u201d for her. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, the 48-year-old actor was asked whether she is open to working with the director despite the recent revelation about the car crash that happened on the sets of Kill Bill.\n\n\u201cIf he wrote a great part! I understand him and if he wrote a great part and we were both in the right place about it, that would be something else,\u201d Thurman said. Earlier this year, Thurman had said in an article that she suffered severe injuries after she was pressured into driving a stunt car she did not feel comfortable operating on the sets of Tarantino\u2019s film.", "images": ["https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/newsguard-check.svg", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/screen-header-photos/IE-logo.svg", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/Jaiswal-20.jpg?resize=150,83", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/05/uma-thurman-759.jpg", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/black-icon-reddit.svg", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/MixCollage-20-Nov-2025-12-01-PM-641.jpg?resize=150,83", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/icons/icon-android.svg", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/icons/clock.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=444470064056909&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/print.svg", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/screen-header-photos/screen.svg", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/05/NASA-posts-mesmerising-new-pictures.jpg?resize=450,253", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/kashmir-times.jpg?w=300", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/Crude-oil-3col_20251120173132.jpg?w=300", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/newsguard-logo-w.svg", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/opinion/images/icon-wapp-share.svg", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/cover-uopdated.png?w=300", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/Kotak-Gambhir.jpg?resize=150,83", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/srk-vivek.jpg?w=300", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/icons/icon-apple.svg", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/Sundar-13.jpg?w=300", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/icons/x-footer.svg", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/01/Sony-Afeela-Image-Source-Sony-Honda-Mobility-1.jpg?resize=450,253", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/01/Untitled-design-2025-01-23T134754.684.jpg?resize=450,253", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/icons/icon-instagram.svg", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/Qualcomm-555.jpg?resize=150,83", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/srk-vivek.jpg?resize=150,83", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/01/Untitled-design-2025-01-22T192057.941.jpg?resize=450,253", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/vivek.jpg?w=300", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/09/Untitled-design-2024-09-07T034235.126.jpg?w=300", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/08/Google-button-2.gif", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/opinion/images/twitter-preferred.svg", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/Sundar-13.jpg?resize=150,83", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2024/09/Untitled-design-2024-09-07T034235.126.jpg?resize=150,83", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/Tartara-Sutaria-Veer-Pahariya-birthday.jpg?resize=450,253", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/icons/icon-linkedin.svg", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/Amitabh-Bachchan-and-R-Balki.jpg?resize=150,83", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/Bengaluru-techie-1.jpg?w=300", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/icons/icon-facebook.svg", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/Kamini-Kaushal-photos.jpg?resize=450,253", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/vivek.jpg?resize=150,83", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/Globetrotter-event-1600.jpg?resize=450,253", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/vande-bharat.jpg?w=300", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/cover-uopdated.png?resize=150,83", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/vip-powered-logo.png", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/Jaiswal-20.jpg?w=300", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/opinion/images/icon-fb-share.svg", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/default-ie.jpg", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/SC-1600.jpeg?w=300", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/oped-illustration-10.jpg?w=300", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/11/Lunar-eclipse-live-20221108-10.jpg?resize=450,250", "https://images.indianexpress.com/2025/11/Nvidias-Jensen-Huang_20251120005414.jpg?resize=150,83", "https://indianexpress.com/wp-content/themes/indianexpress/images/indian-express-logo-n.svg"], "top_img": "https://images.indianexpress.com/2018/05/uma-thurman-759.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kshitij Rawat", "Cdata", "Var Template_Content", "Sso_Login_Box", "Xwelcome Backorenter The Email Address Or Mobile Number Associated With Your Account To Sign In.
