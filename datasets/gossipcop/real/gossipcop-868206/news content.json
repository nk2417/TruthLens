He was 41.\n\nThe coroner\u2019s office said it had been on the scene at the singer\u2019s home in Palos Verdes Estates investigating a suicide. On Friday, Ed Winter, spokesman for the coroner\u2019s office, said Bennington hanged himself. An autopsy is pending. No timeframe was given for report results.\n\nNeither the coroner nor Los Angeles County Fire Department could confirm reports the death was due to hanging.\n\nLaw enforcement received a call around 9 a.m. reporting the death, Elias said. Palos Verdes police said it was unclear if the department was going to release a statement on the matter.\n\nLinkin Park bandmember Mike Shinoda wrote on Twitter: \u201cShocked and heartbroken, but it\u2019s true. An official statement will come out as soon as we have one.\u201d\n\nBennington, a Phoenix native, was open about his struggles with drug and alcohol addiction, which occurred at various times during his life.\n\nThe band had just released its seventh studio album, One More Light, and was set to embark on an extensive North American tour this summer and in the fall.\n\nThe group was one of the most popular rock bands to emerge in the early 2000s. Their debut album Hybrid Theory has sold more than 10 million copies in the U.S. since its release in 2000, per Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nThe band won Grammy awards in 2001 for best hard rock performance for \u201cCrawling\u201d and again in 2005 for best rap/sung collaboration for \u201cNumb/Encore.\u201d\n\nOn May 26, Bennington sang Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah\u201d at the Los Angeles memorial service of Soundgarden rocker Chris Cornell, who had died by suicide. Days earlier, in a note posted online, Bennington wrote a tribute to his friend Cornell saying: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a world without you in it. I pray you find peace in the next life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Cornell family is overwhelmed by the heartbreaking news about Chester Bennington which tragically comes so soon after their family\u2019s own loss,\u201d a Cornell family spokesperson told the Associated Press. \u201cThey open up their loving arms to Chester\u2019s family and share in the sorrow with all those who loved him.\n\nBennington is survived by his wife, Talinda Ann Bentley, and six children.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-695317690_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-695317690_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Parker", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/chester-bennington-dead-suicide-linkin-park-singer-was-41-1022947/", "title": "Linkin Park Singer Chester Bennington Dies in Suicide", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Law enforcement received a call around 9 a.m. on Thursday reporting the death.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Ryan Parker", "tags": "Obituaries", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Linkin Park Singer Chester Bennington Dies in Suicide", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/chester-bennington-dead-suicide-linkin-park-singer-was-41-1022947/", "description": "Law enforcement received a call around 9 a.m. on Thursday reporting the death.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-695317690_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Chester Bennington Dead in Suicide: Linkin Park Singer Was 41"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-20T11:24:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-17T20:22:21+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Law enforcement received a call around 9 a.m. on Thursday reporting the death.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Linkin Park Singer Chester Bennington Dies in Suicide", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-695317690_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500549875.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
