Not too shabby.\n\nBut despite the amazing reception, it wasn't enough to keep her out of the bottom two alongside Nancy Kerrigan, and Heather \u2013 best known for playing Brittany Pierce on the high school musical drama \u2013 was eliminated.\n\nAmid boos of outrage from the audience, host Erin Andrews said to the couple: \"Well, you hear the reaction. I'm shocked, audience not happy, how are you?\"\n\nHeather replied: \"I'm okay. You know, it's a hard competition, and I'm really happy that I got to do exactly what I wanted to do.\"\n\nCo-host Tom Bergeron added: \"I have to say, in 24 seasons, that was probably the most vocally unhappy reaction we've gotten about a result.\"\n\nHe asked Chmerkovskiy how he was feeling, receiving the reply: \"I'm good, I'm good. I put in a lot of work to try and come back and give her the chance.\n\n\"I'm not saying anything. I think [Helen's other pro partner] Alan [Bersten] did an amazing job. I think Heather is my inspiration moving forward.\"\n\nHeather added: \"I really, really want to say thank you to both of them because they were magical. It was fantastic.\"\n\nDancing with the Stars airs Mondays at 8pm ET on ABC.\n\nWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?
