Right now she is in the best shape of her life.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has lost a bunch of weight,\u201d the source continues, adding that the Real Housewives of New Jersey star, 46, is \u201ceven more fit than when she got home [from prison].\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Giudice showed off her muscles in the 40-plus bikini division at the NPC South Jersey Bodybuilding Championships on Saturday in Medford, New Jersey, edging out four women to score third place.\n\nDave Kotinsky/Getty Images\n\nDave Kotinsky/Getty Images\n\nIn order to prepare for the competition and hone her ripped abs, toned arms and muscular legs, the reality star worked out \u201cwith experienced trainers to help her do this in a responsible way,\u201d the source tells PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cAnd she had the time of her life competing,\u201d the insider adds. \u201cShe really enjoyed pushing herself\u2026the discipline, the focus.

So proud of @teresagiudice for stepping on stage today for her first time ever in the bikini division!\u201d she wrote alongside a picture of herself and the reality star backstage.\n\nIn addition to working her muscles at the gym (which she frequently documents on Instagram), Giudice told Women\u2019s Health in 2016 that yoga helped her \u201cget through it all\u201d during her 11-month prison stay, adding that she planned to become an instructor in the practice.\n\n\u201cI love it so much that I want to get certified in it,\u201d she said. \u201cI have a few more months to go. I\u2019m just taking my time, because I have four daughters. It\u2019s a lot, but I\u2019m definitely going to complete it.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Teresa Giudice Splurged on Daughter Gia\u2019s Lavish 17th Birthday Gift: a BMW!\n\nMeanwhile, her husband Joe Giudice, who is currently serving out his 41-month sentence for mail, wire and bankruptcy fraud, has also made some major changes to his body, losing 45 lbs. in prison.\n\nJoe \u2014 who transferred from the Federal Correctional Institution in Fort Dix, New Jersey, to a federal prison in Pennsylvania last November \u2014 has completed more than 27 months of his sentence thus far.
