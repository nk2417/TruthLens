I am talking to you guys specifically, I'm talking to everybody. I miss her,\" he shared as her family wiped away tears. \"It is unfair she is not here. We are going to sing a little song. I am going to be singing every word to her in her honor. Thank you for being here. Christina, we love you.\"\n\nWithin moments, the final members of Team Adam took to the stage with their coach to sing \"Hey Jude\" by The Beatles.", "images":
