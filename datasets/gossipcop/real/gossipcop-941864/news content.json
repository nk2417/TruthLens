Kim Kardashian has had her fair share of feisty feuds and vicious clapbacks over the years. From random social media trolls to A-listers such as Drake and Taylor Swift, the reality star does not hold back when it comes to taking on the haters. In fact, Kardashian [\u2026]\n\nThe Selfish author and husband Kanye West, an avid Trump enthusiast, are committed to continue advocating for prison reform. \u201cKanye has been super vocal about supporting Trump and it seems there is a motive \u2014 one being the release of Chicago inmates,\u201d a source previously told Us. \u201cKim and Kanye have been paying legal bills and fighting to get a handful of people out of jail.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, the KKW Beauty founder dished on her plans to meet with the commander in chief. \u201cI\u2019ve been in communication with The White House and trying to bring [Johnson\u2019s] case to the president\u2019s desk and figure out how we can get her out,\u201d she told Mic on May 9. \u201cThat\u2019s such a huge step from where we started with that not even being not heir radar.\u201d\n\nKardashian added that, if given the opportunity to speak with Trump, she would \u201cexplain to him that, just like everybody else, we can make choices in our lives that we\u2019re not proud of and we don\u2019t think all the way through.
