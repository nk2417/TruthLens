The \"We Found Love\" singer told PEOPLE of her maternity fashion, \"Right now, being pregnant, some days you just feel like, 'Ugh, I just want to lay here on this couch all day.' But when you put on a little face and a little lipstick, you transform.\" \"You put some clothes on, and it's like, when you look good, you feel good,\" Rihanna continued. \"I've heard that for a very long time, but it's true. It really can get you up off that couch and make you feel like a bad bitch.\"\n\n03 of 20 Lady in Red Diggzy/Shutterstock Ahead of Valentine's Day 2022, the Fenty founder and her rapper boyfriend surprised shoppers at the Savage X Fenty store at the Westfield Culver City mall in L.A.

A source told PEOPLE that the fashion mogul \"couldn't be happier.\" \"Having a baby is something she was never focused on, but being with Rocky opened her up to the idea. She couldn't be happier and is so excited to be a mom,\" the source said. \"She's loving all the changes to her body during pregnancy and has always celebrated pregnant women in her runway shows for Fenty.\"\n\n04 of 20 Shine Bright Rihanna.

It's a baby!\"\n\n05 of 20 All Smiles A$AP Rocky and Rihanna. Rich Fury/Getty The only thing more sparkling than Rihanna's outfit at the Fenty Beauty Universe Event were the matching smiles on the couple's faces. Speaking with PEOPLE at the event, Rihanna explained that the pair \u2014 who wore coordinating outfits \u2014 did not plan to match. \"I didn't know what he was wearing. I didn't even see him!\" she said. \"Like, he left the studio to come here.\"\n\n06 of 20 Just Super Ab/BACKGRID The singer made it clear which team she was rooting for in the Super Bowl on Feb. 13, wearing an L.A.
