You can\u2019t keep those suckers down.\u201d\n\nDisick didn\u2019t miss a beat after Thorne left; he was photographed with his former flame Chloe Bartoli, British model Ella Ross and Justin Bieber\u2019s ex Sofia Richie, 18, after Thorne\u2019s departure.\n\nDespite her early exit, Thorne told Entertainment Tonight that she\u2019s still hanging out with Disick.\n\nScott Disick and Bella Thorne were spotted at the airport in May, before their trip to Cannes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re chillin\u2019, we\u2019re friends, we\u2019re cool,\u201d she told ET after returning to Los Angeles. \u201cI literally just saw him.\u201d\n\nDisick, who has attended rehab for substance abuse in the past, stars alongside Kardashian and her famous family on \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/06/14/FQP4EOIHDEEHCRKSJJOGKWDKPE.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/06/14/FQP4EOIHDEEHCRKSJJOGKWDKPE.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter Sblendorio"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/06/14/bella-thorne-says-scott-disicks-partying-was-too-much-for-her-during-cannes-fling-he-really-drinks-a-lot/", "title": "Bella Thorne says Scott Disick\u2019s partying was too much for her during Cannes fling: \u2018He really drinks a lot\u2019", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Peter Sblendorio", "canonical": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/06/14/bella-thorne-says-scott-disicks-partying-was-too-much-for-her-during-cannes-fling-he-really-drinks-a-lot/"}, "description": "One of Scott Disick's short-lived squeezes had no interest keeping up with the Kardashian crew member.", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Bella Thorne says Scott Disick\u2019s partying was too much for her during Cannes fling: \u2018He really drinks a lot\u2019", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/06/14/bella-thorne-says-scott-disicks-partying-was-too-much-for-her-during-cannes-fling-he-really-drinks-a-lot/", "description": "One of Scott Disick\u2019s short-lived squeezes had no interest keeping up with the Kardashian crew member\u2019s intense, booze-heavy lifestyle.
