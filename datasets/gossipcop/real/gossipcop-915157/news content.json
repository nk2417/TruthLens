{"url": "https://people.com/tv/teen-mom-jenelle-evans-husband-david-eason-alleged-homophobic-tweets/", "text": "Many Teen Mom viewers are outraged over homophobic tweets allegedly posted by Jenelle Evans\u2018 husband David Eason this week.\n\nThe MTV star \u2014 who shares a 1-year-old daughter, Ensley, with Evans, and has two kids from previous relationships \u2014 allegedly referred to gay and transgender people as \u201cabominations.\u201d\n\nEason\u2019s Twitter account has since been taken down, but screenshots of the alleged tweets continue to circulate. MTV did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAfter sharing a news story about the possibility of allowing those with concealed carry permits to bring guns onto school property, Eason allegedly tweeted: \u201cIt only makes sense to protect our kids the proper way\u2026 the only way we know how.\u201d\n\nOne Twitter user then suggested that instead of protecting kids with guns, we arm them with \u201ceducation\u201d and \u201cintentional parenting.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you are wrong,\u201d Eason allegedly replied. \u201cPlease tell me sir, how do you propose we make all the people in America start being better parents? Or are you a monkeys uncle?\u201d\n\nJenelle Evans and David Eason. Bruce Glikas/FilmMagic\n\nThe same Twitter user then called on Eason to stop \u201cglorifying assault rifles\u201d and teach his children \u201chow to solve problems without calling people names or using force.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd just what makes you think you have the right to tell me how to be a parent? Because you think you know me?\u201d Eason allegedly responded. \u201cLmao why don\u2019t you go tell the homo and transgender parents to start teaching their kids better morals? Oh I forgot that\u2019s supposed to be normal.\u201d\n\nAnother Twitter user then waded in, asking if Eason was going to teach his children \u201cto hate gay and transgender people.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to teach them not to associate with them or be that way,\u201d he allegedly responded. \u201cIf you lay down with dogs you get up with fleas.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jenelle Evans\u2019 Ex Kieffer Delp Reportedly Arrested in Suspected Meth Lab Bust\n\nFans are now calling on MTV to fire Eason, 29.\n\n\u201cYou know, @MTV, for a network that claims to be tolerant and inclusive of the LGBT community, I have to say I\u2019m shocked you\u2019d still associate with ignorant, bigoted trash like David Eason,\u201d user @BuyMeASlushie tweeted. \u201cAre you seriously going to support someone who equates LGBT people to flea-ridden dogs?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the type of person that\u2019s allowed on tv, the type of person that\u2019 paid by @mtv & @Viacom, and the type of person our youth is influenced by!\u201d user @ImFcknRakin wrote. \u201cWe need to take a stand for gender equality and show our youth they\u2019re loved no matter who they grow up to be! FIRE DAVID EASON!\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Evans issued a statement to TMZ defending her husband.\n\n\u201cDavid didn\u2019t understand how offensive people would get or how Twitter even works. Now that he realizes his voice is very strong within media/tabloids he has deactivated his account. He agrees he will keep his comments to himself from now on,\u201d she said. \u201cDavid doesn\u2019t hate people from the LGBT community. My old manager was gay and used to be one of me and Davids close friends. We attended Farrah\u2019s birthday in Miami with a lot of LGBT people there and he didn\u2019t act in any type of way. We went had a good time and left. We are sorry for the comments that were made.\u201d\n\nEvans\u2019 relationship with Eason was a point of contention on the most recent season of Teen Mom 2: Evans, 26, threatened to quit the show after an episode exposing the couple\u2019s marital tensions aired. Evans later told PEOPLE that she couldn\u2019t stop crying after watching it and felt as though she is \u201calways portrayed as \u2018the bad one\u2019 to them no matter how much I change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the fact that I\u2019ve changed for the better and [I am] happily married, yet [people] perceive David as some angry dad that gets annoyed by his children,\u201d she said. \u201cOr, if MTV does not have the drama from the storyline they want, they try to create drama as hard as they can.\u201d", "images":
