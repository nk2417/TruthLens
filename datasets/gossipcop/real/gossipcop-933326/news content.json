The Love & Basketball star opened up in a new interview about the rumors that she was the actress who bit Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s face at a party in December 2017.\n\nRelated: Beyonce\u2019s Bite: Everything We Know So Far It was the bite heard \u2018round the world. After Tiffany Haddish revealed that an unnamed actress bit Beyonc\u00e9 on her face at a party in December 2017, celebrities and members of the Beyhive flocked to Twitter in an attempt to figure out who would have the audacity to do such a thing. Thank You! You [\u2026]\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the most absurd thing I\u2019ve ever been involved with,\u201d Lathan, 46, said in her June 2018 cover story for Health magazine. \u201cThank God I\u2019ve been in this business for 20 years and have had so many rumors about me. They used to devastate me in my 20s, but in order to survive in this business, you just have to let it roll.\u201d\n\nThe Affair star insisted that she would never have the audacity to do such a thing to Queen Bey, 36, because she is just one of the \u201cFormation\u201d singer\u2019s many fans.\n\nRelated: Celebs Fight Back on Twitter!

It\u2019s so bizarre. I thought it was the funniest thing ever that it was a news story. It\u2019s so crazy.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Tiffany Haddish first revealed in an interview with GQ in March that an unnamed actress bit Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cNear the end of the party, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s at the bar, so I said to Beyonc\u00e9, \u2018Did she really bite you?\u2019 She was like, \u2018Yeah,\u2019\u201d the Girls Trip actress, 38, recalled to the magazine. \u201cI was like, \u2018She gonna get her ass beat tonight.\u2019 She was like, \u2018Tiffany, no. Don\u2019t do that. That bitch is on drugs. She not even drunk. The bitch is on drugs. She not like that all the time. Just chill.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated: Beyonce\u2019s Best Instagram Style There's never a moment when Queen Bey doesn't look flawless\u2014and that's especially true on her Instagram account!

The Alien vs. Predator star quickly shut down the accusations on March 26, tweeting, \u201cY\u2019all are funny. Under no circumstances did I bite Beyonc\u00e9 and if I did it would\u2019ve been a love bite.\u201d", "images":
