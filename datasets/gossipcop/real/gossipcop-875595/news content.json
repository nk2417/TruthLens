Following Kimmel and Leno\u2019s initial back and forth bashing \u2014 Kimmel admitted at the time to \u201csucker-punching\u201d Leno \u2014 the two continued in their public squabble, with Kimmel telling Playboy in March 2013, \u201cI always feel bad if I hurt anybody\u2019s feelings, but I don\u2019t believe Jay Leno has actual feelings, and he doesn\u2019t seem to be that worried about other people\u2019s feelings.\u201d\n\nBut seven years after the feud first began, they have chosen to bury the hatchet.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t argue with [Leno\u2019s] success and his longevity,\u201d the Live! host complimented Leno on the podcast. \u201cI will say, when I was in high school and college, he was one of my all-time favorite comics.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Jimmy Kimmel Tearfully Reveals Newborn Son Billy Underwent Open Heart Surgery\n\nKimmel\u2019s wife Molly McNearney gave birth to William John \u201cBilly\u201d Kimmel on April 21. At 3 days old, Billy underwent surgery at Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles because of his condition \u2014 tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia \u2014 that was preventing his lungs from getting enough oxygen.\n\nBack in May, Kimmel revealed in a tearful monologue on his show that Billy was born with the congenital heart disease.\n\n\u201cBasically, the pulmonary valve was completely blocked and he has a hole in the wall between the left and right sides of his heart,\u201d Kimmel previously explained, adding that despite the successful open heart surgery, Billy will have another operation between 3 and 6 months old.\n\nLast month, Kimmel gave an update on Billy, revealing that his youngest child is doing well just three months after he underwent surgery.\n\nJimmy Kimmel/Instagram\n\n\u201cBilly is three months old today and doing great,\u201d he wrote on social media. \u201cThanks for all your love & support and please remind your Congresspeople that every kid deserves the care Billy got.\u201d\n\nKimmel and McNearney also share a 3-year-old daughter, Jane. The host has two older children \u2013 Kevin and Katie \u2013 from a previous relationship.", "images":
