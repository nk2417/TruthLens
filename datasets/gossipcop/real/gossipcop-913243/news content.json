(AP Photo/Chuck Burton)\n\nSerena Williams may make jaws drop when she plays tennis, but her adorable baby daughter Alexis Olympia is making hearts melt on the court.\n\nThe seven-time Wimbledon champion returned to competition for the first time since she went on maternity leave, at the Fed cup in North Carolina on Sunday.\n\nBut watching from the crowd, little Alexis Olympia seemed mesmerised as mum stepped back onto court.\n\nAlexis Ohanian, the husband of Serena Williams with their baby, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. in the crowd (AP Photo/Chuck Burton)\n\nUnfortunately, Serena and younger sister Venus lost their doubles match to Holland\u2019s Demi Schuurs and Lesley Kerkhove.\n\nBut, as reported by the Mirror, she was more concerned with her little girl being present at the match.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s great. It\u2019s her first match so I\u2019m glad she got to see it,\u2019 Serena gushed at the Cellular Arena.\n\nSerena was bedridden for six weeks after a series of complications \u2013 including a pulmonary embolism that led to multiple surgeries \u2013 following the birth of her daughter by emergency caesarean\n\nsection.\n\nVenus and Serena Williams competed at the Fed Cup, Serena\u2019s first competitive match since she gave birth in September last year (Picture: AP Photo/Chuck Burton)\n\nWith this in mind, the crowds applauded and cheered the superstar as she fought her way back into competitive tournaments.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
