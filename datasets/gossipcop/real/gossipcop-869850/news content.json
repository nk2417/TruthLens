Mindy Kaling has walked her first red carpet since it was revealed that she\u2019s expecting her first child. The Wrinkle in Time actress attended the Television Critics Association\u2019s summer press tour to promote her Hulu series The Mindy Project in L.A. on Thursday, July 27.\n\nKaling, who has kept the identity of the father private, opened up about the comedy\u2019s final season and how her character will face mom-shaming.\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: TV Pregnancies: How Stars Worked Around Their Baby Bumps At least they could indulge their cravings at craft services! Take a look back at Kerry Washington, Alyssa Milano, Rachel Bilson and more celebrities who had to strategically hide their baby bumps on television while they were pregnant\n\n\u201cMarriage was a big [goal] for Mindy and now finally has it and what\u2019s fun about this season is showing the reality of marriage and what lived up to expectations and what didn\u2019t \u2014 and then frankly getting disillusioned with it over the course of the season,\u201d Kaling, 38, told the crowd.\n\nExecutive producer Matt Warburton chimed in: \u201cI think she\u2019s going to learn a little bit more about how to be a good, involved parent. We have a really funny episode where [Modern Family\u2018s] Julie Bowen plays a rival mother who thinks that Mindy\u2019s not doing that great of a job.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated: Celebrity Babies of 2017 Babies on board!

I think that happily ever after can sometimes be romantic happiness and sometimes it can be a feeling of contentment with your life, as a professional and as a mother \u2026 We just have such a good finale that we\u2019ve known about for awhile.\u201d\n\nThe Mindy Project\u2019s final sixth season debuts on Hulu on September 12.", "images":
