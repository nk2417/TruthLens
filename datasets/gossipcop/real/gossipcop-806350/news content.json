Through the years, her style has evolved, but she's consistently proved herself to be quite the fashionista, especially on Country Music's Biggest Night, at the CMA Awards.\n\nUnderwood has donned everything from short and sparkly dresses to downright glamorous gowns, and the \"Southbound\" hitmaker can pull off every single color of the rainbow, from tangerine orange to kelly green. During her 11 years as co-host of the CMAs, Underwood's outfit changes throughout the show were expected -- looked forward to, even -- and she rarely disappointed.\n\nClick through the photo gallery below to see the singer's best looks from CMA Awards past, starting with her 2006 CMA Awards red carpet dress:\n\nFollowing the 2019 CMA Awards, Underwood stepped down as show co-host, leaving room for Reba McEntire and Darius Rucker to take her and Brad Paisley's place.\n\nThe 2020 CMA Awards are scheduled to take place on Nov. 11 and will air live from Nashville on ABC beginning at 8PM ET. Due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, the show will be hosted at Nashville's Music City Center, not Bridgestone Arena as is customary, and there will be no live audience.\n\nThe Boot will be staying up late covering the most buzzed-about winners, fashion and moments at the 2020 CMA Awards.
