After keeping it under wraps for a few months, Girls Trip star Tiffany Haddish told GQ the story of how she witnessed an anonymous actress take a bite at Beyonce\u2019s face at a party in December. As expected, Mrs. Carter played it cool, but Haddish \u2014 and an army of extremely loyal fans \u2014 are furious.\n\nExplore Beyonc\u00e9 See latest videos, charts and news\n\nThe Cut and Vulture both conducted investigations in attempts to expose the teethy culprit. Model-turned-90210-star Sara Foster was one of the names in question. Foster quickly denied the accusations via her Instagram, on which she captioned a screenshot of an email requesting comment on the matter: \u201cFlattering that anyone thinks I could get this close to Beyonce\u201d\n\nAnother suspect was Sanaa Lathan, best known for her role in Love & Basketball. She also shot down the rumors on her social media, tweeting that if she ever felt compelled to lay a tooth on Beyonce, \u201cit wouldv\u2019e been a love bite.\u201d\n\nY\u2019all are funny.
