The report was confirmed by producers Suzanne Mackie and Andy Harries.\n\nFoy told Entertainment Weekly following the uproar: \"I'm surprised because I'm at the centre of it, and anything that I'm at the centre of like that is very, very odd, and feels very, very out of ordinary.\n\n\"But I'm not [surprised about the interest in the story] in the sense that it was a female-led drama,\" she added. \"I'm not surprised that people saw the story and went, 'Oh that's a bit odd'.\n\n\"But I know that Matt feels the same that I do, that it's odd to find yourself at the centre [of a story] that you didn't particularly ask for.\"\n\nProducers at Left Bank Pictures apologised for the pay disparity in a statement which said: \"We want to apologise to both Claire Foy and Matt Smith, brilliant actors and friends, who have found themselves at the centre of a media storm this week through no fault of their own.\n\n\"Claire and Matt are incredibly gifted actors who, along with the wider cast on The Crown, have worked tirelessly to bring our characters to life with compassion and integrity.\n\n\"As the producers of The Crown, we at Left Bank Pictures are responsible for budgets and salaries. The actors are not aware of who gets what, and cannot be held personally responsible. We all have a responsibility to do what we can to ensure that these issues are tackled, and as a leading production company we want to make our contribution to the debate.\"\n\nSince the controversy, Left Bank Pictures have confirmed they will pay Olivia Colman, who will take over the role of The Queen in series three of The Crown, the same wage as the yet-to-be-announced actor who portrays the older Prince Philip.\n\nMackie pledged: \"Going foward, no one gets paid more than the Queen.\"", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/15/22/the-crown-skyline.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/15/22/the-crown-skyline.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-crown-pay-gap-claire-foy-responds-matt-smith-netflix-apology-a8273771.html", "title": "The Crown: Claire Foy responds to controversy over Matt Smith pay gap", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/tv/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "News that 'Doctor Who' actor was paid more than Foy, who starred as the Queen, caused uproar among fans and critics", "og": {"updated_time": "2018-03-26T12:01:16.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Claire Foy responds to The Crown pay controversy", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-crown-pay-gap-claire-foy-responds-matt-smith-netflix-apology-a8273771.html", "type": "article", "description": "News that 'Doctor Who' actor was paid more than Foy, who starred as the Queen, caused uproar among fans and critics", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/15/22/the-crown-skyline.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/15/22/the-crown-skyline.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-26T12:01:16.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-26T12:01:16.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "TV & Radio", "author_name": "Roisin O'Connor", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 588, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 2, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 6, "external_link_count": 3}, "date": "2018-03-26T12:01:16.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Claire Foy responds to The Crown pay controversy", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "News that 'Doctor Who' actor was paid more than Foy, who starred as the Queen, caused uproar among fans and critics", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/15/22/the-crown-skyline.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Claire Foy\",\"Matt Smith\",\"The Crown\",\"Netflix\",\"Prince Philip\",\"Queen Elizabeth II\",\"Gender pay gap\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522065676.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
