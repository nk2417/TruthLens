And she certainly kept fans up to date on every moment of her pregnancy as she and her family prepared to go from a family of three to a family of five.\n\n\n\nRelated\n\nShe was also quite candid about how she was preparing to give birth to her two little boys. \"I love knowing my body can handle childbirth; it\u2019s such a beautiful gift to experience a vaginal delivery drug-free. It\u2019s not scary, it\u2019s exhilarating! It\u2019s badass! It\u2019s spiritual! It hurts like hell but I can handle it! And I\u2019m looking forward to each mind-blowing contraction because out comes two babies at the end. I do hope it\u2019s quick and relatively easy but if not, I can handle that, because I have before. I\u2019ve prepped my body by treating it like a temple through nourishment, I\u2019ve prepped my mind by breathing and meditating, I\u2019ve prepped my spirit by praying: I\u2019ve got this. Let\u2019s do it.\"\n\nSee more Meghan, below.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/icons/youtube-social.min.svg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/188/507/RHOC-1920-First-Look.jpg?itok=FnnhNaKE", "http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/icons/twitter-x-social.min.svg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/06/dish-meghan-king-edmonds_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/scale_600/public/dish-mke-jim-edmonds-embed-01.jpg?itok=rl0Ffb71", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/341/431/171122_3624477_Meghan_King_Edmonds_Reveals_She_s_Pregnant_W.jpg?itok=aMspFjy1", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/806/155/170728_3560053_Peggy_Physically_Shuts_Meghan_s_Mouth.jpg?itok=JMduRhNd", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/scale_600/public/dish-mke-jim-edmonds-embed-02.jpg?itok=UfUBGqjf", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2024/04/shop-bravocon-merch.jpg?itok=oT3veOb0", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/794/63/170804_3563913_Is_Meghan_Jealous_of_Peggy_.jpg?itok=ggwR0vO7", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2025/06/nbcuniversal_peacock_logo.svg_1.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/icons/snapchat-social.min.svg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/1_1_medium/public/2025/10/01_wkd2_500x500_web_art_pl_f01_102725.jpg?itok=lWnW6oK6", "http://www.bravotv.com/modules/custom/ls_stripe/components/gated-slate/img/heartlock.svg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2024/05/million-dollar-listing-season-15-josh-altman-heather-altman-01.jpg?itok=sVWprKet", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/711/955/RH_of_OrangeCounty_1920_PreviewClip_2_thumb_2.jpg?itok=xiQCQ5LH", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_1310x530/public/2025/06/rhoc_s19-web-dynamiclead-desktop-1920x1080.png?itok=VTNgjg7h", "http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/icons/instagram-social.min.svg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/WickedxBravo_LOGO%20%281%29_new.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/icons/facebook-social.min.svg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/181/251/frame_124081.jpg?itok=0s0EYSwn", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/16_9_medium/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/341/431/171122_3624477_Meghan_King_Edmonds_Reveals_She_s_Pregnant_W.jpg?itok=aMspFjy1", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2024/11/amanda-batula-kyle-cooke.jpg?itok=VhaZtI4U"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/06/dish-meghan-king-edmonds_0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/the-real-housewives-of-orange-county-meghan-king-edmonds-gives-birth-to-twin-boys", "title": "The Real Housewives of Orange County's Meghan King Edmonds Gives Birth to Twin Boys", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1137711, "parsely-section": "The Daily Dish Blog Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"Meghan King Edmonds Welcomes Twin Boys\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"The Daily Dish\"},\"field_tv_shows\":\"The Real Housewives of Orange County\",\"field_microsite\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1075801\",\"site_section\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/06\\/dish-meghan-king-edmonds_0.jpg?itok=3W_hcZBV\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/06\\/dish-meghan-king-edmonds_0.jpg?itok=MWZ3mkbf\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/06\\/dish-meghan-king-edmonds_0.jpg?itok=n7XmpKF0\",\"70x70\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/fp_scale_crop_70x70\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/06\\/dish-meghan-king-edmonds_0.jpg?itok=Y6MgBvQm\"}}", "description": "Meghan King Edmonds' family just grew by two.
