It was later revealed that the fall forced her to get between 40 to 50 stitches on her face to help recover from injuries. When she finally revealed the extent of her injuries in an Instagram post on Dec. 27, she did so by covering most of her face with a scarf.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\nFor the next few weeks, Underwood\u2019s Instagram feed mostly didn\u2019t have photos of her with the exception of a few throwbacks to pictures from before the injury.\n\nThen on Feb. 10, she posted an image working out inside her home with her now 3-year-old son Isaiah. However, thanks to some camera positioning and Underwood turning her head to her left to look at her son, fans could only see the uninjured right side of her face.\n\nFast forward to Friday and Underwood actually took a selfie with her husband, NHL player Mike Fisher. However the bottom half of her face was covered up by the logo of the End It Movement, an organization that looks to end slavery in the modern world.\n\nAlong with the selfie, the two celebrated Isaiah\u2019s third birthday this past weekend with an impressive Mickey Mouse Clubhouse cake.\n\nRumors of a divorce between Underwood and Fisher have also been spreading as the \u201cJesus Take the Wheel\u201d singer continues to recover, though Fisher assured fans on Instagram that the two have \u201cnever been better.\u201d", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/04/70839b1d-3826-4242-9848-ca2fff9b687f.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/70afec6a-3143-4947-b047-428e525611d4.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Connor Casey", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/country-music/news/carrie-underwood-hidden-face-stitches-fall-instagram/", "title": "All the Creative Ways Carrie Underwood Has Hidden Her Face Since Fall", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "All the Creative Ways Carrie Underwood Has Hidden Her Face Since Fall", "description": "It\u2019s been months since Carrie Underwood took a hard fall at her Nashville home, and the Grammy winner has been extra creative when it comes to anyone seeing her face.
