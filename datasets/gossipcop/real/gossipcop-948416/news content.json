He had surgery to remove the tumor and further treatment through the early part of 2017. Then the cancer returned last autumn and he died in January,\u201d Delaney wrote in a statement shared on his Facebook page.\n\nRob Kim/Getty\n\n\u201cHenry was a joy. He was smart, funny, and mischievous and we had so many wonderful adventures together, particularly after he\u2019d moved home following 15 months living in hospitals,\u201d continued Delaney, saying that even though Henry\u2019s \u201ctumor and surgery left him with significant physical disabilities,\u201d his son had \u201cquickly learned sign language and developed his own method of getting from A to B shuffling on his beautiful little bum.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis drive to live and to love and to connect was profound,\u201d added Delaney.\n\nThe Deadpool 2 star went on to remark that while Leah and Henry\u2019s two older brothers were \u201cdevastated of course,\u201d they had also helped Delaney \u201cendeavor to not go mad with grief.\u201d\n\nIn April, Delaney also shared a touching tribute to his late son on what would have been the toddler\u2019s third birthday. \u201cHere\u2019s Henry not long before he died,\u201d the actor captioned a photo of his son on Twitter.\n\n\u201cYou can see his little tracheostomy tube on his neck and his left eye is turned in due to nerve damage from surgery,\u201d he added. \u201cHe has a bus & a turtle though so he\u2019s happy. He was such a sweet boy.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/gMciBUVCeW6B9VirT54yCbBIdk4=/343x228/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Delilah-050625-25ce20b40a8a41348206beedf65fedcc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/SVpmb408wsPUpV9kCrRFe8duWyk=/343x228/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Chris-Stein-daughters-110525-0971765569a5427b8c1401e853bf8d6a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/dgktq5IKLokjPLjaryZ2MiHLRlQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/oscar-isaac-111725-1-20c96e812e1048709a584417bb2b10cb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/LztNjwaQ-ix4eK4edUooLhNiWi4=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anna-kepner-3-111025-c6a90b2f57474459a89ae04e296ec343.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/eJkl_3SLsiJ5cCHJOlCPw9BZEJ4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/robe-lowe-3-f3491cb8e55f42eb91fd3b485cde7fa7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/L7_RUJTW2y38l1Sca4F1KAEY1FU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Catalina-Mancera--Marshawn-Kneeland-111225-1-18774eb0acff468eaa5827d2acc32158.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/q8O_LaZtNHmAcfYxcsa66TUGvzk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/john-5-rita-lowery-instagram--nicolle-111025-7ecdbffab3c04e43abb253c4b47f0dde.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ipRsS9ed5Sne1FabG0sXOHjYDlY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(756x0:758x2)/rob-delaney-d161dabe47364a4fae13987d40b38aed.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/EmJjbxgwBynerdTxfk1Oroe7FFw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jon-bon-jovi-jesse-bongiovi-baby-111025-9b9ed983be4745fea94b90ca1223afe0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/DkyCjF6wV3g0mj0C7qrncQ0CbyE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Chris-Stein-daughters-110525-0971765569a5427b8c1401e853bf8d6a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/kCtNhPovgCHZqh1nkm-Ac9Rm_ko=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/krissy-taylor-1-100625-3068c6441e0949098109b06db08894c8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ThISMFE-Pok7KvPumhExQZpXIf4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Pusha-T-Virginia-Williams-111425-e5afd20105be4904a2f1837b47be9c24.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2CFMtDotJghmm8HnOy-DwJJo6_Y=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/terry-crews-kids-6a93188241eb4b64912d090f8d3369d8.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/XwQyixXA_011ylkQPHQEydOxz4Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/kardashian-kids-111723-b9dc7981e88e493aad4ae1113e3f4f65.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/BB7vYW82d0oBPiFINmr76DIy2dY=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ben-dreyfuss-richard-dreyfuss-111925-b670f8ab6f994d1d9dfce1fa0726d205.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/OiX_ye6NXv8PukVFGEvyhmPabbs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cody-johnson-brandi-johnson-2024-CMAs-112124--4666897e03994747a6ea5196f08d0212.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/sSQCkaM5Qxck88LwUEUbTEc8c4Q=/343x228/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kenny-Chesney-talks-love-and-grief-with-Anderson-Cooper-111425-1cc89418da0b4d1b8375893e5efc3637.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4zqFmeIjzRqHeulkACO94Ht76aU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jennifer-hudson-david-1-111725-ca255ecc7efc4ce9aea2c90614e351cb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/KRMdYMFlg5SzIyKJd5ij_i1RzXU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cardi-b-111425-504046a36f1844129d1ddbe57e29786a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/9TiDG1mcy_pxYIGOm81_Yl6pRQg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kenny-Chesney-talks-love-and-grief-with-Anderson-Cooper-111425-1cc89418da0b4d1b8375893e5efc3637.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/KM-5XYmy50q-j4RL55Dp-_vTVXM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jana-Kramer-and-Roman-IG-111324-be31c57bc9d84e0788169fd4fe8b66df.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/KHcfm0_rGDCVvB_5vAqZLV47n_o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Delilah-050625-25ce20b40a8a41348206beedf65fedcc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0jKnK8bSyr7Fb41sXsNwd1jtAFM=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jenna-bush-hager-minka-kelly-today-with-jenna-and-friends-111925-7e3c2b8605fe4a96a1b712c168083adb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/zdFS1n2y9dNM-ndOtRjWY9G0kI4=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Daniella-Karagach-111925-ls-1ffa54ba0f1749e380cfe98771660e16.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/v_0aru5V_OcxlJRjK9y0ChlwBy4=/4000x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(756x0:758x2)/rob-delaney-d161dabe47364a4fae13987d40b38aed.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/ipRsS9ed5Sne1FabG0sXOHjYDlY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(756x0:758x2)/rob-delaney-d161dabe47364a4fae13987d40b38aed.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "Maria Pasquini Is The Senior News Editor For The Human Interest Vertical At People.
