But it seems that Sony accidentally uploaded a press file that, when loaded into Photoshop, showed that alterations were made to reduce DiCaprio\u2019s chin and remove wrinkles from Pitt\u2019s neck. The altered photo can be seen above, followed by the unaltered version.\n\nSony has since deleted the press file and said in a joint statement with the film\u2019s production team that Pitt and DiCaprio \u201cdid not request any retouching of photography. [\u2026] We take full responsibility for the error.\u201d\n\nIn the upcoming film, DiCaprio and Pitt\u2019s characters look for one last chance at a big film in a Hollywood that has long since left them behind. But their lives are flipped upside down when their next door neighbor, Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie), is infamously killed by Charles Manson and his cult.\n\n\u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d will be released July 26, 2019.\n\nPage Six first reported news of the photo flub.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/5x4_082025_COVER_B.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Once-Upon-A-Time-In-Hollywood-e1541122533404.jpg?fit=618%2C428&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bangalter.png?fit=300%2C169&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Pitt-DiCaprio-photoshop.jpg?resize=556%2C257&quality=89", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeremy-Fuster.png?resize=150%2C150&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeremy-Fuster.png?fit=53%2C58&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Once-Upon-A-Time-In-Hollywood.jpg?resize=640%2C443&quality=89"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Once-Upon-A-Time-In-Hollywood-e1541122533404.jpg?fit=618%2C428&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeremy Fuster", "Film Reporter", "Joined Thewrap In", "Covers Box Office", "Labor News.
