He wore a baseball cap and asked for the quietest, most out-of-the-way table possible. His hat was tilted down. It definitely seemed like he wanted to be incognito,\u201d an insider told us.\n\nThe athletic duo sat close to each other in a quiet booth and feasted on cheeseburgers and monkfish and drank malbec and pinot noir. We\u2019re told they ended the evening by sipping espresso and strolling together down the street.\n\nMargolius, 24, is nearly a decade younger than Rodgers, who is 33, and she\u2019s much more under-the-radar than his Hollywood actress ex, Munn.\n\nThe soccer star is a native of Acton, Mass., and graduated from Harvard University in 2015. She played soccer for Ope IF in Sweden after college.\n\nRodgers was with \u201cThe Newsroom\u201d star Munn for three years before they broke it off in April. At the time, Us Weekly reported that \u201cthe big issue is that Olivia doesn\u2019t get along with his family. They think she\u2019s controlling,\u201d a source told the magazine.\n\nRodgers\u2019 relationship with his family continues to be \u201ccomplicated,\u201d even with Munn out of the picture.\n\nIt was reported in June that Rodgers still wasn\u2019t talking to his family after a rift developed over Munn.\n\nThe football star has since been linked to Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model Kelly Rohrbach and Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn.\n\nPals of Rohrbach and Rodgers insisted that the two are \u201cjust friends.\u201d\n\nVonn also shut down dating buzz after fans spotted her comments on Rodgers\u2019 Instagram posts. \u201cEveryone is kind of blowing this Instagram comment thing with me and Aaron out of proportion. We\u2019re friends,\u201d Vonn said.\n\nA rep for Rodgers would not comment on the nature of his relationship with Margolius, and she could not be reached.", "images": ["https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fblomingdales.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115847739.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115919105.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2FFF-WP.png?w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115916411.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/aaron-rodgers.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115918976.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115875312.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115838388.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115879604.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/paige2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115901196.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115919105.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/aaron-rodgers.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Felemis-black-friday.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1763642967&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115883447.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115905155.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115918976.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115874796.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115918332.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115905155.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115901196.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/08/aaron-rodgers.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/08/14/aaron-rodgers-rebounds-from-olivia-munn-with-soccer-star/", "title": "Exclusive | Aaron Rodgers rebounds from Olivia Munn with soccer star", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
