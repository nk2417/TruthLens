She puts her money on Metta World Peace, despite the fact EW's own Dalton Ross postulated he might be the worst player \"ever\" in the history of the game. Pulliam thinks that cluelessness might just be a stealth tactic, though, saying \"Let me tell you, I think they are completely sleeping on him\u2026 he said, \u2018The longer you all keep me, I'm coming for you.'\"\n\nWatch the clip above for more. The Talk airs weekdays on CBS.", "images":
