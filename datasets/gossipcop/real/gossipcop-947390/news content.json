Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon opened The Late Show and The Tonight Show using the same cold open, which also guest starred Conan O\u2019Brien, whose own program on TBS is on hiatus this week.\n\nThe clip finds Colbert typing his monologue for the night when he receives a call from Fallon. \u201cHey, Lowlife,\u201d Fallon says as Colbert answers. The comedian\u2019s response? \u201cHey, Lost Soul.\u201d They\u2019ve borrowed those nicknames from Donald Trump\u2019s speech in South Carolina Monday night, where the president continued his anti-late-night tirade\u2014a feud he first ignited earlier this week, when he slammed Fallon for saying that he regrets mussing Trump\u2019s hair on air in 2016.\n\nIn the clip, Colbert and Fallon chat about the president\u2019s comments before calling O\u2019Brien to join the party. (Since he\u2019s on hiatus, the bit depicts the Conan host in the middle of shaving his beard and chest.) After the three hang up, the version of the video shown on CBS ends with Colbert running out on stage, as he always does. But this time, he\u2019s announced not as \u201cStephen Colbert,\u201d but as \u201cThat Guy from CBS\u201d\u2014another homage to the president\u2019s speech, in which he refused to name the comedian with whom he\u2019s battled most intensely.\n\nThis might be the first time in late-night history that two shows have used the same cold open. When reached for comment by Variety, O\u2019Brien briefly explained how the bit came together: \u201cColbert reached out to me this morning. I have since had my number changed.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690ceab84ab9d3e623decb16/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6914cea29fe6cb3e588f4d02/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/66e3496b1d2e398b5578d9d4/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690944318b75c927a793b8d6/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690cc76e6fd8f93f16471d8d/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68f7a7dcc43cdce515acbc3f/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690ce036e4de48864a6dff15/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b33893a8ff299585cab1a84/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/colbert-stephen-fallon.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6916186f683a0692afe31876/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69179ba6c81135ffa2639014/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b30f4456163e4725653cc64/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/trump-fallon.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68f7b0a81f7229cf43b80e3a/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b198f550341dd3d59e088a1/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/t-late-night-monologue.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b323033acd469252aac11b2/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/trump-fallon-response-late-night-south-carolina-rally.png"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b33893a8ff299585cab1a84/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/colbert-stephen-fallon.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Bradley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/trump-fallon-colbert-conan-joint-cold-open-tonight-show-late-show", "title": "Colbert, Fallon, Conan Stage a Historic Group Chat to Gossip About Trump", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Laura Bradley", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "This might be the first time in late-night history that two late-night shows have colluded like this.", "id": "5b3375e3acd469252aac11dc", "keywords": "stephen colbert,jimmy fallon,donald trump,conan o'brien,late show,tonight show,late night,television,conan", "news_keywords": "stephen colbert,jimmy fallon,donald trump,conan o'brien,late show,tonight show,late night,television,conan", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b3375e3acd469252aac11dc", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"This might be the first time in late-night history that two late-night shows have colluded like this.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b33893a8ff299585cab1a84/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/colbert-stephen-fallon.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b33893a8ff299585cab1a84/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/colbert-stephen-fallon.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "This might be the first time in late-night history that two late-night shows have colluded like this.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b33893a8ff299585cab1a84/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/colbert-stephen-fallon.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Colbert, Fallon, Conan Stage a Historic Group Chat to Gossip About Trump", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/trump-fallon-colbert-conan-joint-cold-open-tonight-show-late-show"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-06-27T12:36:13.746Z", "modified_time": "2018-06-27T12:36:13.746Z", "author": "Laura Bradley"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "This might be the first time in late-night history that two late-night shows have colluded like this.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b33893a8ff299585cab1a84/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/colbert-stephen-fallon.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Colbert, Fallon, Conan Stage a Historic Group Chat to Gossip About Trump"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b33893a8ff299585cab1a84/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/colbert-stephen-fallon.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google": "nopagereadaloud", "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530102973.746, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
