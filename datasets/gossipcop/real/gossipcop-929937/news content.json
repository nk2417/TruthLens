Maggie had no idea Jackson was funding the contest, and she confronts April (Sarah Drew) for not telling her, and April confronts Richard (James Pickens Jr.) for not telling her, and Richard confronts Catherine (Debbie Allen) for not telling him, but Catherine didn't know either.\n\nCatherine had brought in a crisis manager named Erin, and Catherine and Erin conclude Catherine should take the fall for her father-in-law's crimes, but Jackson shuts down that idea.\n\n'There's no way a powerful black woman is going down for an old white guy who couldn't keep his hands to himself,' he says.\n\nDecides: Jackson shuts down the idea of blaming Catherine for the Harper Avery scandal\n\nMeanwhile, Erin wants Jackson and Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) to take on a charity case to help salvage the hospital's reputation: A charity called Angels of Humanity is bringing in a Venezuelan boy named Diego (Luis Fernando Cordova) with a massive tumor on his face.\n\n'What, is there something on my face?' Diego jokes when he meets the surgeons.\n\nBut the charity's representatives find out about the Harper Avery scandal and say they want to take Diego elsewhere, citing their religious background, but Mer gets them to stay by offering to operate on Diego pro bono. Mer favors an aggressive approach to take out the whole tumor, but Jackson is planning to take a more conservative tack to ensure a good outcome for the sake of the PR.\n\nPR Stunt: A charity called Angels of Humanity is bringing in a Venezuelan boy named Diego (Luis Fernando Cordova) with a massive tumor on his face who needs to be operated on\n\nPlans: Mer favors an aggressive approach to take out the whole tumor, but Jackson is planning to take a more conservative tack to ensure a good outcome\n\nScandal: The charity's representatives find out about the Harper Avery scandal and say they want to take Diego elsewhere, citing their religious background\n\nAs they scrub in, Mer and Jackson talk about the Harper Avery fallout. (At the start of the episode, Meredith decides to return her Harper Avery Award, likening it to spoiled milk.)\n\nThinking aloud, Meredith wonders why her knee-jerk reaction has been to be angry with Cerone when she should be angry with Harper, Cerone's harasser.\n\n'Why is it so easy to blame the women?' Mer muses. Jackson replies: 'A couple thousand years of patriarchy.'\n\nJackson proposes reaching out to all of Harper's victims \u2014 now numbering 37 \u2014 but Mer says the solution has to be more sweeping. 'You wanna rebuild, you have to tear it all down first,' she says.\n\nJackson applies that logic to Diego's case, deciding mid-operation to go Meredith's route and take out the entire tumor. Then he applies the same logic to the PR crisis.\n\nHe and Meredith find Erin and Catherine getting ready to release a statement putting all the blame on Catherine, and he fires Erin on the spot.\n\nDamage control: Jackson proposes reaching out to all of Harper's victims \u2014 now numbering 37 \u2014 but Mer says the solution has to be more sweeping\n\nCover up: Jackson's being asked to perform a life-saving surgery on a child with Meredith Grey as a way to distract the press from the Harper Avery scandal\n\nRequest: The hospital brings in crisis management to help them sort out the allegations against Harper Avery, which includes a life-saving operation\n\n'I'll be damned if I let grandfather do to you what he did to all those women,' he tells his mom.\n\nInstead, Jackson and Meredith give Catherine a new statement to read to the press \u2014 one announcing the dissolution of the Harper Avery Foundation, vowing to 'repay, retrain, and rehire every victim of Harper Avery', and announcing the founding of the Catherine Fox Foundation (a nod to Catherine's maiden name). Catherine and Richard are delighted with the idea.\n\nLater, Jackson visits Maggie \u2014 who by this point has been assured by April that Jackson 'can be complicated but not morally' \u2014 and Maggie says she knows Jackson only kept his funding of the contest a secret so he could compete, too.\n\nIn non-Harper Avery developments, Owen (Kevin McKidd) is bringing new foster son Leo to the hospital for the little guy's six-month check-up. As he hunkers down in the waiting room, he happens to sit down next to Leo's birth mom, a teenager named Betty (Peyton Kennedy).\n\nAmelia (Caterina Scorsone) meets Betty and recognizes a kindred spirit, and when they have a moment alone, Amelia asks how long Betty has been using. Betty initially denies any addiction but soon admits she developed an opioid dependency after a soccer injury. Worse yet, she's homeless now.\n\nAmelia decides she wants to take Betty in after getting Richard's blessing for the idea. 'You see something is this girl, you go ahead and drag her,' Richard tells her. 'Now, it might not work, but if it does, you've saved a life.'\n\nElsewhere: Owen (Kevin McKidd) is bringing new foster son Leo to the hospital for the little guy's six-month check-up and meets his birth mom Betty\n\nIdea: Amelia decides she wants to take Betty in after getting Richard's blessing for the idea but Mer isn't too keen so Owen suggests Amelia and Betty move in with him\n\nHelping hand: Betty eventually accepts the offer, and Amelia makes Betty promise to call her parents, to not use drugs, and to attend meetings with her\n\nSince Mer might not be keen on the idea of an addict moving into Chez Grey, Owen suggests Amelia and Betty move in with him and Leo, which would also give Betty a chance to get to know her son. Betty eventually accepts the offer, and Amelia makes Betty promise to call her parents, to not use drugs, and to attend meetings with her. Easier said than done, we imagine.\n\nElsewhere in the hospital this episode, Alex (Justin Chambers) and Jo (Camilla Luddington) start planning their wedding, but April offers to take over, so Alex and Jo instead focus on setting a budget. Alex looks concerned when he checks his bank account, but he doesn't tell Jo why. (Such an Alex thing to do.)\n\nLater, Alex's ex Nurse Olivia (Sarah Utterback) returns to the hospital for the first time since she was fired in Season 6. Her son has a chew toy stuck in his throat, and when Jo and Alex take up the case, awkwardness ensues.\n\nBlast from the past: Alex's ex Nurse Olivia (Sarah Utterback) returns to the hospital for the first time since she was fired in Season 6\n\nChange of heart: Olivia warms up to Alex, however, once he and Jo get the toy out of the boy's throat, and tell him she's too good for him\n\n'Is he still giving the nurses syphilis, or has he moved on to gonorrhea?' Olivia asks Jo. Olivia warms up to Alex, however, once he and Jo get the toy out of the boy's throat.\n\n'She's too good for you,' she tells Alex, referring to his fianc\u00e9e. Alex replies: 'You think I don't know that?'\n\nAt the end of the episode, Jo asks Alex why he's been moody ever since he checked his bank account, and he tells her: 'I have money, way too much money.'\n\nHe has realized his mom \u2014 who, by the way, is living with schizophrenia \u2014 hasn't been cashing the checks he sends her monthly.\n\n'I'm out here living my life, and I'm just throwing money at a problem without paying much attention,' he says.\n\nIn other news, DeLuca has been calling out of work for days, opting to camp out on Meredith's couch, strum his guitar, and nurse his broken heart. Mer asks Arizona (Jessica Capshaw) for help, and Arizona calls upon girlfriend Carina (Stefania Spampinato), who goes to Chez Grey and yells at DeLuca in Italian.\n\nAlso, Arizona asks Carina if she doesn't like Arizona's daughter, Sofia, since Carina doesn't seem to be interested. Carina says she actually is interested but thinks Arizona coddles Sofia too much. (And for her part, Sofia has still been very, very sad, Arizona reports.)\n\nAnd finally, Bailey is confronted outside the hospital by a lawyer representing now-fired intern Roy (Rushi Kota), who is suing for restitution of employment, as well as unspecified damages for pain and suffering, since Bailey unwittingly gave him a marijuana cookie. Man, he's harshing her mellow\u2026 and just when the hospital solved one legal crisis!", "images":
