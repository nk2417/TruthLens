Kim Kardashian, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Kris Jenner team up against Scott Disick in a sneak peek from the Sunday, May 14, episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nRelated: 15 Times Scott Disick Was the Best Part of \u2018KUWTK\u2019 See 15 times Scott Disick was the best part of \u2018Keeping Up With the Kardashians'!\n\nIn the previous \u201cTo Be Continued\u201d episode, the Kardashians discovered that Disick, 33, had invited a girl named Chelsea along on the family trip to Costa Rica. During a group dinner, Kim, 36, and Khlo\u00e9, 32, started talking about Chelsea Handler and Chelsea Clinton in an attempt to get Disick to admit to his actions. When that didn\u2019t work, Jenner, 61, asked point blank: \u201cI think what we\u2019re all wondering is if you have a girl here and why?\u201d\n\nRelated: Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s Body Evolution From Keeping Up With the Kardashians to the red carpet, Kourtney Kardashian's look has changed over the years \u2014 see her body evolution!\n\nIn the preview, it appears the self-proclaimed Lord owns up to bringing Chelsea along on the tropical getaway. \u201cI did something wrong as always,\u201d he says. It seems Kim, Khlo\u00e9 and Jenner don\u2019t accept his apology**, because they all throw water on Disick and completely douse him.\n\nRelated: The Cutest Kardashian Kids Moments Ever!

She\u2019s upset he would disrupt the family vacation with the kids there and the whole family there and hide a girl in the hotel.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs on E! Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
