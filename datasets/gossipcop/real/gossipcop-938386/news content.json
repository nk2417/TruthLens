The camera then pulled back to reveal Mustard standing on a raised platform while pink, purple and blue laser lights exploded around him. The backdrop behind them flashed interstellar CGI imagery of alien desert landscapes and striking geometric figures while Jonas crooned the moody dance track and Mustard hyped the crowd.\n\nJonas was also nominated for a Golden Popcorn trophy at the Monday (June 18) night show as an actor; he was up for best on-screen team as part of the cast of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. The JoBro lost the award to the Losers Club from It, but at least his performance was a victory.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Nick-Jonas-and-Mustard-2018-mtv-movie-awards-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Nick-Jonas-and-Mustard-2018-mtv-movie-awards-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Lynch", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/nick-jonas-mustard-2018-mtv-movie-tv-awards-8461699/", "title": "Nick Jonas & Mustard Bring Otherworldly \u2018Anywhere\u2019 to 2018 MTV Movie & TV Awards", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Nick Jonas and Mustard transformed the MTV Movie and TV Awards into an otherworldly laser lights show when they brought their collab \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anywhere\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to the stage at the Tiffany Haddish-hosted show.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Joe Lynch", "tags": "bbnews", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Nick Jonas & Mustard Bring Otherworldly \u2018Anywhere\u2019 to 2018 MTV Movie & TV Awards", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/nick-jonas-mustard-2018-mtv-movie-tv-awards-8461699/", "description": "Nick Jonas and Mustard transformed the MTV Movie and TV Awards into an otherworldly laser lights show when they brought their collab \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anywhere\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to the stage at the Tiffany Haddish-hosted show.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Nick-Jonas-and-Mustard-2018-mtv-movie-awards-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Nick Jonas and Mustard"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-19T02:28:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-19T07:26:48+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Nick Jonas and Mustard transformed the MTV Movie and TV Awards into an otherworldly laser lights show when they brought their collab \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anywhere\u00e2\u20ac\u009d to the stage at the Tiffany Haddish-hosted show.", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Nick Jonas & Mustard Bring Otherworldly \u2018Anywhere\u2019 to 2018 MTV Movie & TV Awards", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Nick-Jonas-and-Mustard-2018-mtv-movie-awards-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529375317.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
