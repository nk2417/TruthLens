It was Em's decision. She is doing okay. She is strong and focused on her son. She loves being a mom,\" a source told People.\n\nAnd the pair are planning to divorce, amid infidelity claims, per a Page Six source. \"Yeah, he cheated,\" the insider said of Bear-McClard, calling him \"gross\" and adding that \"he's a serial cheater.\"\n\n\n\nNeither the stars nor their reps have confirmed the allegations.\n\nRumors of a potential breakup first spread when Ratajkowski was spotted on a walk with her son this Thursday without her wedding band. She also has not been seen out with Bear-McClard in some time, instead choosing to step out solo in her array of inspiring street looks to walk her dog or spend time with her child.\n\nThe model married actor and film producer Bear-McClard in 2018 in a low-key ceremony at a courthouse attended only by a handful of their closest friends. At the time, she dressed in a mustard yellow suit from Zara and black hat, because she said she didn't feel right wearing white, as she is \"not a pure woman.\" Three years later, in March of 2021, the pair welcomed son Sylvester Apollo.\n\nThough Ratajkowski and Bear-McClard have never revealed too much about their marriage, the My Body author said on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon after their surprise wedding that the two made their own rings the night before saying \"I do\" by melting an ounce of gold they bought in New York's Chinatown. \"We're both interesting little humans, is what I would say,\" she said at the time.\n\nRatajkowski has remained silent on Instagram this week. Her last post with Bear-McClard is from May 27, 2021\u2014two photos of her straddling him in the park in a red minidress and kissing him. \"Was fully preggo here and didn't know it,\" she captioned the post.", "images": ["https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523000000&id=social-button-icon",
