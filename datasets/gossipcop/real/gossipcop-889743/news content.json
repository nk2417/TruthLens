Sorry, spilling the tea now.\u201d\n\nPrior to marrying Meghan in 2014, Jim was married to Allison Raski for six years. The two divorced in 2014, but Jim insists that he and his current wife were not sleeping together while he was still married to Allison, according to E! News.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous first of all and second of all, we have a family and to sit there and say that (Meghan) was my mistress is beyond crazy,\u201d Jim explained. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever said anything to anyone but I just can\u2019t deal with the bulls\u2013t lies anymore.\u201d\n\nUp Next: Kelly Dodd Announces Plan to Divorce Her Husband\n\nThe sports broadcaster added, \u201cI\u2019m 100 percent sure she\u2019s fully aware that she\u2019s making up lies and the information she got was incorrect.\u201d\n\nJim said he was trying to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d and protect his family by speaking out so strongly against Kelly\u2019s accusation.\n\n\u201cI just think that there should be repercussions for people who make up flat-out lies just to put themselves on TV because they have nothing better to say. I am tired of listening to Kelly\u2019s lies,\u201d Jim said.\n\nThe former MLB player continued, \u201cI\u2019m not looking for publicity, I just can\u2019t let my wife sit there and be killed and have to worry about this bullsh-t when she has a baby and all this IVF stuff going on.\u201d\n\nJim threw in a jab at Kelly as well, bringing up her recent divorce filing in his response.\n\n\u201cHer relationship is completely a disaster. She\u2019s filed for divorce and moved out and was having her own situations. I think she should worry about her own damn self,\u201d Jim explained to us. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to spread rumors about somebody, they better be true or you should have to pay some consequences for spreading lies.\u201d\n\nReal Housewives of Orange County airs Monday nights at 9 p.m. EST on Bravo.", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/billy-ray-cyrus-elizabeth-hurley-2.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-lainey-wilson-devlin-hodges-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/08/32a08016-72b7-41f8-b593-df0f660db84e.png?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Rumer", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/news/rhoc-jim-edmonds-denies-kelly-dodd-mistress-accusation/", "title": "\u2018RHOC\u2019 Husband Jim Edmonds Slams Kelly Dodd\u2019s Mistress Accusation", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'RHOC' Husband Jim Edmonds Slams Kelly Dodd's Mistress Accusation", "description": "Jim Edmonds is setting the record straight after Real Housewives of Orange County cast member Kelly Dodd made a brutal allegation that his current wife Meghan King Edmonds was once his mistress.
