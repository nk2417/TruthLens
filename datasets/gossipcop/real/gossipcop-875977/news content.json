But, first let's get to that buzzy clip.\n\nCheck out the post on Youtube\n\nOn Sunday August 27, Taylor dropped the full-length version at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, and it's a glittering, self-aware visual that tears down everything fans think they know about Taylor Swift while poking fun at every, single thing you've ever poked fun of her about, from always being surprised at award shows, to public perception that she's always playing the victim. Taylor acknowledges \u2014 and makes fun of herself for \u2014 every one of those things during the eye-popping video by bringing back to life all of her personas. Of course, this includes Taylor from the 2009 VMAs AKA the night that Kanye West bum rushed the stage. (Oh, you remember it.)\n\nRelated\n\nSince Taylor dropped \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" which is probably about her beef with Kim and Kanye, there have been very mixed reactions from fans and haters alike.\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nAhead of the video's premiere, the Internet was already making noise, with many buzzing that the teaser shot (which features Taylor fiercely standing in front of spandex-clad dancers) resembled a similar shot from Beyonce's \"Formation\" music video and Lemonade era.\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nHowever, director Joseph Kahn (who has worked with Taylor in the past, as well as Beyonc\u00e9, Britney Spears, and, like, all your favorite pop stars during his career), shut down that chatter on Twitter ahead of the video's premiere.\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nCheck out the post on X", "images":
