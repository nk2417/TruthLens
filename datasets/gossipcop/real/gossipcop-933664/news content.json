There's nothing like a powerful woman walking into a room; her presence is like nothing else.\"\n\nThe seven-time-grand-slam winner went on to laud the powerful women she sees in sport today.\n\n\u201cThere are so many emerging forces,\u201d she said, \u201cthere's been so much growth for women in sports. It's very exciting.\n\n\u201cYou have to be able to stand up for what you believe in and I think I've done a good job. I guess I don't have too many regrets.\"\n\nYounger sister Serena also features in the magazine interview, hailing Venus for her \u201cstrong and powerful\u201d qualities, describing her as an \u201coverachiever\u201d.\n\nopen image in gallery The full interview appears in the June issue of ELLE UK, on sale 9 May ( ELLE UK )\n\nWilliams isn\u2019t the only high-profile female to distance herself from the feminist label.\n\nDespite espousing feminist values and being strong advocates for equal rights, stars like Katy Perry, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kelly Clarkson and Susan Sarandon have all distanced themselves from the terminology.\n\nSome abhor it as \"old-fashioned\" while others choose to identify with what they perceive to be less loaded terms, opting for the \"humanist\" moniker, which funnily enough has nothing to do with equality at all and is actually a Renaissance philosophy that advocates human agency over supernatural superstitions.\n\nEven Judd Apatow, whose TV series Girls was constantly at the vanguard of important conversations surrounding feminism throughout its five-year-run, doesn\u2019t call himself a \u201cfeminist\u201d.\n\nWhat\u2019s in a name?
