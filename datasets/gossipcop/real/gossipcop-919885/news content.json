We have all learned a lot from Buffy, and the best part is, that never ends.\"\n\nShe then shared a quote that her character, Buffy Summers, said in season seven's episode \"Bring on the Night\": \"From now on, we won\u2019t just face our fears, we will seek them out. We will find them, and cut their hearts out one by one. There is only one thing on earth more powerful than evil, and that\u2019s us.\"\n\n\"Scroll through for some behind the scenes pictures, then and now (hopefully there will even be some you have never seen) #buffyslayday,\" she added.\n\nCharisma Carpenter, who portrayed Cordelia Chase, also took to Twitter to thank all the Buffy fans for their devotion to the show.\n\n\"What a ride, We\u2019re 21 today! Thanks to all you die hards out there that make us a big part of your lives. STILL!\" she tweeted. \"Your love and devotion to our show does not go unnoticed. So grateful! Thank You! ?? #BTVS #BuffySlayDay21st #cordeliachase #cordy #queenc #theoriginalscoobies.\"\n\nMichelle Trachtenberg, known as Buffy's little sister Dawn, also congratulated the show on its 21st anniversary.\n\nLast year, all three actresses, along with David Boreanaz, Alyson Hannigan, James Marsters and more original Buffy cast members, reunited for an epic 20-year anniversary photo shoot.\n\nSee more of last year's reunion in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/buffy_sarah_michelle_gellar_gettyimages-1150569.jpg?h=c38a5341&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/buffy_sarah_michelle_gellar_gettyimages-1150569.jpg?h=c38a5341", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-03/buffy_ss_three_1280_huilu.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-04/gellar_vidpic_040517_1280Copy2.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-05/et_JamesMarsters_052417_1280.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2024-06/mk-WILLIAM-DANIELS%2C%20WILL-FRIEDLE-1920-x-800-GALLERY-HERO.jpg?h=2dd012a0&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/buffy_sarah_michelle_gellar_gettyimages-1150569.jpg?h=c38a5341", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/sarah-michelle-gellar-celebrates-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-anniversary-with-rare-pics-from-the-show", "title": "Sarah Michelle Gellar Celebrates 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' Anniversary With Rare Pics From the Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/buffy_sarah_michelle_gellar_gettyimages-1150569.jpg?h=c38a5341", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Charisma Carpenter and Michelle Trachtenberg also posted about the show on their social media accounts.", "title": "Sarah Michelle Gellar Celebrates 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' Anniversary With Rare Pics From the Show", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/sarah-michelle-gellar-celebrates-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-anniversary-with-rare-pics-from-the-show", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Charisma Carpenter and Michelle Trachtenberg also posted about the show on their social media accounts.", "twitter": {"description": "Charisma Carpenter and Michelle Trachtenberg also posted about the show on their social media accounts.", "title": "Sarah Michelle Gellar Celebrates 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' Anniversary With Rare Pics From the Show", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/sarah-michelle-gellar-celebrates-buffy-the-vampire-slayer-anniversary-with-rare-pics-from-the-show", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/buffy_sarah_michelle_gellar_gettyimages-1150569.jpg?h=c38a5341", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Sarah Michelle Gellar Celebrates 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' Anniversary With Rare Pics From the Show | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Sarah Michelle Gellar, Buffy the Vampire Slayer", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
