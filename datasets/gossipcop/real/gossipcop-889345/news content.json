At 6-foot, 3-inches, he wanted me to do fashion shows with these 6-foot-tall women.\u201d\n\nSorbo says he was invited to a dinner party where he met Sophia Loren, opera star Luciano Pavarotti, Richard Gere and others. He was invited for several more dinner parties, each one with fewer attendees, until one time it was him and Versace alone, where he told Sorbo he wanted him in commercials advertising his fashion brand.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, his hand goes up my leg,\u201d says Sorbo. \u201cDude, you know I\u2019m straight?\u201d he told Versace.\n\n\u201cThis is why I like you. You\u2019re not a girly man. You are a man\u2019s man,\u201d Versace told Sorbo, according to his recollection.\n\n\u201cIn life, you must fuck everything. You must do the dog, and the cat, and the boy, and the girl,\u201d the actor recalls Versace telling him.\n\nSorbo says he told Versace they were leading two different lifestyles, then Versace said to him he wanted to \u201cbuild a bridge\u201d between them. \u201cThe bridge was never built, and I never got the campaign,\u201d Sorbo says. \u201cI got four free dinners.\u201d\n\nSorbo was on Carolla\u2019s podcast to promote faith-based film Let There Be Light, which opens Friday. The film is notable as it is Fox News personality Sean Hannity\u2019s first foray into filmmaking as the movie\u2019s executive producer.\n\nVersace was one of the world\u2019s leading fashion designers before he was shot to death at his Miami Beach mansion in 1997. His murder will be explored next year in FX\u2019s American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace.\n\nSorbo later told The Hollywood Reporter that he remained friends with Versace.\n\n\u201cHe booked me for his fashion shows but I never got his campaign, but I knew the game, just like I know the game of Hollywood,\u201d Sorbo told THR. \u201cCasting couches have always been around. I don\u2019t play that game, nor do I care to.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kevin_sorbo.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kevin_sorbo.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paul Bond", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/kevin-sorbo-alleges-designer-gianni-versace-sexually-harassed-him-1051637/", "title": "Kevin Sorbo Alleges Designer Gianni Versace Sexually Harassed Him", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The actor, most famous for playing Hercules, claims the late Italian designer made an unwanted sexual advance while he was working as a model.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Paul Bond", "tags": "Adam Carolla, autoplay, Kevin Sorbo, Sean Hannity", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kevin Sorbo Alleges Designer Gianni Versace Sexually Harassed Him", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/kevin-sorbo-alleges-designer-gianni-versace-sexually-harassed-him-1051637/", "description": "The actor, most famous for playing Hercules, claims the late Italian designer made an unwanted sexual advance while he was working as a model.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kevin_sorbo.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Kevin Sorbo Alleges Designer Gianni Versace Sexually Harassed Him"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-24T19:09:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-17T20:52:16+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The actor, most famous for playing Hercules, claims the late Italian designer made an unwanted sexual advance while he was working as a model.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kevin Sorbo Alleges Designer Gianni Versace Sexually Harassed Him", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kevin_sorbo.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508872192.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
