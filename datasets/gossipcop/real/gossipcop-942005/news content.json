When done right, it\u2019s the perfect blend of high-stakes competition, seriously tough challenges, delicious-looking food and, of course, a dash of drama. And Food Network Star has it all \u2014 plus two hosts with some real chemistry. Don\u2019t believe us? Go watch a bloopers reel of Giada De Laurentiis and Bobby Flay; we\u2019ll wait.\n\nWhen all is said and done and a winner is crowned, if you\u2019re anything like us, you likely reach for your phone the second the finale ends, typing \u201cwhat\u2019s (season winner name) doing now\u201d or \u201c(season winner name) Instagram\u201d in the Google search bar to figure out what they\u2019ve been up to since filming wrapped. We\u2019re here to tell you there\u2019s no shame in looking up every single winner from past seasons, either.\n\nSo, to make things easier, we did the work for you. Before Season 14 premieres at 9/8c on June 10, catch up on what every Food Network Star winner has done since nabbing that coveted title.\n\nA version of this article was originally published in May 2016.", "images": ["https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/x6uckhejygj9heq9wyni.jpeg?w=300", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/t5iaqdcilqni6b4igwd3.png?w=1920", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/wnsodrnzcublwgymjcj2.jpeg?w=300", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-sheknows-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/g4d94s1hevqpbhsaxul9.jpeg?w=300", "https://trc.taboola.com/1394147/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/a5n58votlxgeuka6a1p2.jpeg?w=300", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/eopcpzezg1o8ms8ttrmc.jpeg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/z5c7prbveshiuynux6zl.jpeg?w=300", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/qnkmm08derpu0c3ltr0x.jpeg?w=300", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/t5iaqdcilqni6b4igwd3.png?w=1024", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/idwjlekh1hlzrnr0frcn.jpeg?w=300", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/fkpjspuifxpuy4e3mdjj.jpeg?w=300", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/zveo78vvwuon4czunlfm.jpeg?w=300", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ogylmrkfvitbmjmk6chf.jpeg?w=300", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/udfmjbdaqndu45eayoo5.jpeg?w=300", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/wkvfi5x9k0ndzdcuvco7.jpeg?w=300", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SK_Banner_How_to_Rasie_Adults.gif", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/nof8iyo3r98u4tyeohay.jpeg?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/t5iaqdcilqni6b4igwd3.png?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chanel Dubofsky", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/slideshow/6055/food-network-star-where-are-they-now/", "title": "Food Network Star Winners: Where Are They Now?", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Your complete guide all the 'Food Network Star' winners and what they're up to now.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Chanel Dubofsky", "tags": "Food Network, Reality TV", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "'Food Network Star' Winners: Where Are They Now?", "url": "https://www.sheknows.com/entertainment/slideshow/6055/food-network-star-where-are-they-now/", "description": "Your complete guide all the 'Food Network Star' winners and what they're up to now.", "site_name": "SheKnows", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/t5iaqdcilqni6b4igwd3.png?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "'Food Network Star' Winners: Where Are They Now?"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-30T21:30:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-08T17:22:49+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Your complete guide all the 'Food Network Star' winners and what they're up to now.", "site": "@sheknows", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/chaneldubofsky", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Food Network Star' Winners: Where Are They Now?", "image": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/t5iaqdcilqni6b4igwd3.png?w=1024", "text": {"title": "'Food Network Star' Winners: Where Are They Now?"}}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/cropped-sk-fav-icon.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527715800.0, "source": "https://www.sheknows.com", "summary": ""}
