Netflix was a big winner, too, with its supernatural drama \"Stranger Things\" landing at No. 2 overall and other originals like \"13 Reasons Why,\" \"Orange Is the New Black,\" and \"House of Cards\" dominating the streaming-only list.\n\nIn the movie category, the superhero blockbuster \"Wonder Woman\" lassoed the honors. \"La La Land\" took second place, possibly after the mix-up that briefly awarded it the Oscar for Best Film (which was actually won by \"Moonlight\").\n\nHere's the full list of most-tweeted movies and TV shows:\n\nMovies:\n\n1. Wonder Woman\n\n2. La La Land\n\n3. Dunkirk\n\n4. Spider-Man: Homecoming\n\n5. Justice League\n\n6. It\n\n7. Beauty and the Beast\n\n8. Thor: Ragnarok\n\n9. Black Panther\n\n10.
