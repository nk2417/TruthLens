Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.\n\nAt such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.\n\nThe Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/15/11/walking-dead.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/15/11/walking-dead.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/15/11/walking-dead.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-walking-dead-stuntman-died-john-bernecker-season-8-scott-gimple-tribute-amc-a7842526.html", "title": "The Walking Dead cast pay tribute to stuntman who died after on-set accident", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/tv/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "'John\u2019s work will continue to entertain and excite audiences for generations'", "og": {"updated_time": "2017-07-15T10:58:08.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "The Walking Dead cast has paid tribute to the stuntman who died in an on-set accident", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-walking-dead-stuntman-died-john-bernecker-season-8-scott-gimple-tribute-amc-a7842526.html", "type": "article", "description": "'John\u2019s work will continue to entertain and excite audiences for generations'", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/15/11/walking-dead.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/15/11/walking-dead.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-15T10:58:08.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-07-15T10:58:08.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "TV & Radio", "author_name": "Jacob Stolworthy", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 317, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 6, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 1, "external_link_count": 1}, "date": "2017-07-15T10:58:08.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176299319"}, "twitter": {"title": "The Walking Dead cast has paid tribute to the stuntman who died in an on-set accident", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "'John\u2019s work will continue to entertain and excite audiences for generations'", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/15/11/walking-dead.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"The Walking Dead\",\"The Walking Dead season 8\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500116288.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
