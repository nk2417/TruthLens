I definitely understand that, but I was also on a medication that severely blacks you out and impairs your judgment and messes with your balance,\" she noted. \"I didn't know you were supposed to not drink on it. So, it really just caused a horrible, horrible blackout. It was like I went under anesthesia and just woke up.\"\n\nOlympios said she has since watched some of the footage from BiP as well as the first episode of the show. \"It's like I'm watching not me, I'm watching someone else,\" she said. \"I was, like, in shock.\"\n\nSince the incident, Olympios admitted that she's made some changes in her life. \"I definitely am weening off that medication,\" she shared. \"It was very scary what happened, and I cut down the drinking.\"\n\nAs for her feelings towards Jackson following the scandal, Olympios insisted, \"I wish him well. There's no bad blood there. I wish him well always.\"\n\nShe also doesn't blame the producers for halting production over the incident. \"I would hope that if a producer saw anything that was uncomfortable with with anyone [that] they would do the proper investigations to make sure that everybody is safe,\" she said. \"I am super thankful.\"\n\nThat being said, Olympios does see herself as a \"victim of the media.\"\n\n\"All of a sudden people became an expert on the situation and what happened. I'm still trying to figure out what happened. It was just horrible to deal with,\" she said of the media firestorm that ensued after news broke of the scandal. \"It got really, really bad. I mean, it got a lot better, but the things people say is just insane.\"\n\nOlympios will tell more of her side of the story to Chris Harrison on Tuesday's episode of Bachelor in Paradise.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_corinne_082917_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/DEMARIOJACKSON082217VIDPIC.png?h=55bf7bde&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-08/bipletdown_1280_hulu.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_demarioCLIP_082217.jpg?h=adc4fd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-08/gettyimages-838705392.jpg?h=6b7011a3&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2024-04/mk-Gerry-Turner-and-Theresa-Nist-2-1920-x-800-GALLERY-HERO-TEAR.jpg?h=0a35da97&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_corinne_082917_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/corinne-olympios-explains-bachelor-paradise-incident-and-why-she-called-herself-victim-86252", "title": "Corinne Olympios Explains 'Bachelor in Paradise' Incident and Why She Called Herself a 'Victim'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_corinne_082917_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The reality star reveals what she remembers before blacking out while cameras were rolling.", "title": "Corinne Olympios Explains 'Bachelor in Paradise' Incident and Why She Called Herself a 'Victim'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/corinne-olympios-explains-bachelor-paradise-incident-and-why-she-called-herself-victim-86252", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The reality star reveals what she remembers before blacking out while cameras were rolling.", "twitter": {"description": "The reality star reveals what she remembers before blacking out while cameras were rolling.", "title": "Corinne Olympios Explains 'Bachelor in Paradise' Incident and Why She Called Herself a 'Victim'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/corinne-olympios-explains-bachelor-paradise-incident-and-why-she-called-herself-victim-86252", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_corinne_082917_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Corinne Olympios Explains 'Bachelor in Paradise' Incident and Why She Called Herself a 'Victim' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, TV, Bachelor In Paradise, Corinne Olympios, DeMario Jackson", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
