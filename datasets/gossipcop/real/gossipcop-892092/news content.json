The firm employed undercover agents, one of whom posed as a women\u2019s rights activist, to meet with McGowan and obtain information on her forthcoming book, the story states.\n\nWeinstein employed Black Cube and Kroll, a corporate security firm, in an effort to block stories in the New Yorker and the New York Times detailing decades of allegations of sexual misconduct, according to the New Yorker.\n\nThe story also highlights the role of David Boies, of the firm of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP, who is said to have overseen much of the spying effort. Running such an investigation through a law firm can make it subject to attorney-client privilege, which would protect it from disclosure in litigation. Boies told the New Yorker that the arrangement was a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nIn a statement to the New Yorker, Weinstein spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister accused the publication of trafficking in \u201cinaccuracies and wild conspiracy theories.\u201d\n\nAccording to the story, Black Cube also retained a freelance journalist to contact McGowan and two other women with accusations against Weinstein, as well as reporters working on the story.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/harvey-4.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/harvey-4.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gene Maddaus", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/film/news/harvey-weinstein-spies-accusers-1202608495/", "title": "Harvey Weinstein Hired Investigators to Spy on Accusers, New Yorker Reports", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The New Yorker reports that Harvey Weinstein hired investigators to keep tabs on his accusers.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Gene Maddaus", "tags": "Harvey Weinstein Scandal, Rose Mcgowan", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Harvey Weinstein Hired Investigators to Spy on Accusers, New Yorker Reports", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/film/news/harvey-weinstein-spies-accusers-1202608495/", "description": "The New Yorker reports that Harvey Weinstein hired investigators to keep tabs on his accusers.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/harvey-4.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Harvey Weinstein"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-07T00:30:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-07T00:30:49+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The New Yorker reports that Harvey Weinstein hired investigators to keep tabs on his accusers.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@GeneMaddaus", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Harvey Weinstein Hired Investigators to Spy on Accusers, New Yorker Reports", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/harvey-4.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510014649.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
