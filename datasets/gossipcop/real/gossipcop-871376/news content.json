There was actually, sadly, another dog which was cast, who is this big dog\u2019s son, but it died just before. Mustafa, who is the father, and this huge, huge dog, was initially in this scene \u2026 My character, Connie, has this affinity with dogs; he thinks he is a dog in a previous life and he thinks he has control over animals,\u201d he said.\n\nRobert Pattinson reveals the outlandish thing \u201cGood Time\u201d directors Ben and Josh Safdie asked of him during filming.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this one scene we shot \u2014 there\u2019s a drug dealer who bursts into the room, and I was sleeping with the dog and basically giving the dog a hand job.\u201d\n\nPattinson clarified that he refused to actually perform the sex act, though it does still appear in the film thanks to a stellar prop department. Rather than touch the canine actor in such a way, fake dog genitals were used for simulation.\n\n\u201cWow, Hollywood is a great place. It really is,\u201d Kimmel retorted.\n\nFans will see that scene and more in the DVD version of \u201cGood Time,\u201d Pattinson revealed during the late night TV show interview.\n\nThe crime drama, which has received high praise from critics, is set to be released on Aug. 11 in the United States.", "images": ["data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/08/04/S3Z3YMZ4NDKHB6D6JFE4BEPAZM.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/08/04/S3Z3YMZ4NDKHB6D6JFE4BEPAZM.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caitlyn Hitt"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/08/04/robert-pattinson-refused-to-perform-sex-act-on-a-dog-in-good-time/", "title": "Robert Pattinson refused to perform sex act on a dog in \u2018Good Time\u2019", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Caitlyn Hitt", "canonical": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/08/04/robert-pattinson-refused-to-perform-sex-act-on-a-dog-in-good-time/"}, "description": "You've gotta draw the line somewhere.", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Robert Pattinson refused to perform sex act on a dog in \u2018Good Time\u2019", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/08/04/robert-pattinson-refused-to-perform-sex-act-on-a-dog-in-good-time/", "description": "You\u2019ve gotta draw the line somewhere.
