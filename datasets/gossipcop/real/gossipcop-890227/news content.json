This is just the beginning,\u201d he said of what he called the \u201cdarkness\u201d in Hollywood. \u201cIt\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. So everything you\u2019re seeing is building up to what I believe will be a dam breaking open.\u201d\n\nFeldman said that he needs the $10 million for security, lawyers, marketing and producers ahead of making the feature film, which he said will not be a documentary. In the interview, Lauer reminded the former child star that he previously promised to name names in his 2013 memoir \u201cCoreyography,\u201d but failed to do so. Feldman said that his publisher refused to allow him to expose the names of the alleged predators.\n\n\u201cThis is why I\u2019m doing this,\u201d he said of his new campaign. \u201cBecause when I wrote my book, the publishers prevented me from writing the names down. They made me change the names.\u201d\n\nLauer later pressed Feldman on why he chose to make appearances in the press now instead of going to the police.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve told the police \u2026 They\u2019re on record. They have all of this information. But they were scanning Michael Jackson. All they cared about was trying to find something on Michael Jackson. Michael was innocent \u2026 I told them, \u2018He was not that guy,\u2019\u201d Feldman said, adding that he gave them all of the names of people he alleged had molested him.\n\nFeldman also claimed that he has received death threats from those who are trying to keep him from releasing any information. He said that a \"statute of limitations\" in California has prevented him from going to the police again, which is why he wants to make this film.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not playing around. It\u2019s serous stuff and I vow I will release every single name that I have any knowledge of, period. And nobody is going to stop me this time as long as people support this,\u201d he said.\n\nWatch Felman\u2019s interview on \u201cToday\u201d below.", "images": ["https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/logos/AJC/logo-white.svg?d=2167", "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/QU4EBBQ24NALPA7BSCPTVEFJPQ.jpg?auth=bc2fb9402ed857eb36566c23e325d2a58adc0edbbfa0ce520399b75a9a04d6e4&width=500&height=500&smart=true", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/icons/search-burger.svg?d=2167", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/logos/AJC/logo-short.svg?d=2167", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/logos/AJC/logo-full-redesign.svg?d=2167", "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net%2F06-26-2020%2Ft_9b387aad961d4354bb23464c431646b7_name_F22127FCD0A243B3A259A940396B1601?auth=fc8505394e48c6602926835b3ac1018a4a697bc763b84b707b19d07d2f39310b&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/MOSBRF73KVEDHGSEPI4NIU5TRA.jpg?auth=5192ad2fa362f5a990aebad2d8f3cb40d0d3aa983a12c7fc7f6b98ce099a2be5&width=950&height=950&smart=true"], "top_img": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net%2F06-26-2020%2Ft_9b387aad961d4354bb23464c431646b7_name_F22127FCD0A243B3A259A940396B1601?auth=fc8505394e48c6602926835b3ac1018a4a697bc763b84b707b19d07d2f39310b&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/corey-feldman-vows-expose-every-single-name-his-alleged-abusers-hollywood/AcH1Nrm0fhl7u7Sr3ne1eI/", "title": "Corey Feldman vows to expose \u2018every single name\u2019 of his alleged abusers in Hollywood", "meta_data": {"description": "Former child star Corey Feldman announced plans on Friday to crowdsource $10 million to make a documentary that will expose the truth behind sexual ab", "feedinclude": "true", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Former child star Corey Feldman announced plans on Friday to crowdsource $10 million to make a documentary that will expose the truth behind sexual abuse in Hollywood.", "image": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net%2F06-26-2020%2Ft_9b387aad961d4354bb23464c431646b7_name_F22127FCD0A243B3A259A940396B1601?auth=fc8505394e48c6602926835b3ac1018a4a697bc763b84b707b19d07d2f39310b&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "site": "@ajc", "title": "Corey Feldman vows to expose \u2018every single name\u2019 of his alleged abusers in Hollywood", "url": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/corey-feldman-vows-expose-every-single-name-his-alleged-abusers-hollywood/AcH1Nrm0fhl7u7Sr3ne1eI/"}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2017-10-31T18:49:12Z"}, "url": "https://www.ajc.com/JYI56E3CQAODQIZBTF2QIYLN5Q"}, "fb": {"app_id": 366816260017522, "pages": 13310147298}, "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net%2F06-26-2020%2Ft_9b387aad961d4354bb23464c431646b7_name_F22127FCD0A243B3A259A940396B1601?auth=fc8505394e48c6602926835b3ac1018a4a697bc763b84b707b19d07d2f39310b&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "secure_url": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net%2F06-26-2020%2Ft_9b387aad961d4354bb23464c431646b7_name_F22127FCD0A243B3A259A940396B1601?auth=fc8505394e48c6602926835b3ac1018a4a697bc763b84b707b19d07d2f39310b&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "title": "Corey Feldman vows to expose \u2018every single name\u2019 of his alleged abusers in Hollywood", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/corey-feldman-vows-expose-every-single-name-his-alleged-abusers-hollywood/AcH1Nrm0fhl7u7Sr3ne1eI/", "description": "Former child star Corey Feldman announced plans on Friday to crowdsource $10 million to make a documentary that will expose the truth behind sexual abuse in Hollywood.", "site_name": "ajc"}, "thumbnail": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net%2F06-26-2020%2Ft_9b387aad961d4354bb23464c431646b7_name_F22127FCD0A243B3A259A940396B1601?auth=fc8505394e48c6602926835b3ac1018a4a697bc763b84b707b19d07d2f39310b&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "language": "English", "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "story.meter": "premium", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=414120752, app-argument=https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/corey-feldman-vows-expose-every-single-name-his-alleged-abusers-hollywood/AcH1Nrm0fhl7u7Sr3ne1eI/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.ajc.com", "summary": ""}
