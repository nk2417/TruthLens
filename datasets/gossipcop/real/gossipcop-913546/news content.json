I am so thankful for all the opportunities today. I am so grateful for the love and support.\u201d\n\nAfter rising to fame two and a half years ago, the Brooklyn-born youngster first caught attention when dancing in a rainbow tutu at the 2015 Pride Parade and has since made quite the name for himself.\n\nA performer of what he calls \u201ckinderdrag\u201d, the 10-year-old is the youngest member of the original iconic pioneering voguing ballroom house, the House of UltraOmni and says he is inspired by the fashions of the Club Kids and Blitz Kids as well as Andy Warhol, Alexander McQueen and Comme des Garcons.\n\nBut, that\u2019s not all. The self-confessed \u201cdrag slayer\u201d even sashayed for RuPaul at DragCon who told the crowd he was \u201cthe future of America\u201d.\n\nLiving by the motto, \u201cBe Yourself, Always\u201d, Napoles is also an LGBT+ advocate, and is launching the first ever drag house for drag kids later this year called the Haus of Amazing.\n\nSpeaking of his achievements portrait photographer and film director, Danielle Levitt, wrote on Instagram, \u201cIt gives us so much joy to watch this 10-year-old person grow up.\"\n\n\u201cDesmond is a visionary child - he loves pageantry, drag and the larger queer community. A child yes, but if there is one thing I have learned from my work it is listen.\n\n\u201cBravo Desmond is Amazing, may we all follow your lead.\u201d", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/13/13/esmond-amazing-gypsy-sport.jpg", "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/13/13/esmond-amazing-gypsy-sport.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/13/13/esmond-amazing-gypsy-sport.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/new-york-fashion-week-drag-kid-desmond-is-amazing-napoles-runway-debut-gypsy-sport-lgbt-pride-a8208466.html", "title": "New York Fashion Week: Meet the 10-year-old \u2018drag kid\u2019 that just made his runway debut", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "Fashion", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/life-style/fashion", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "As a boundary-breaking fashion brand that\u2019s known for its diverse representation, Gypsy Sport is no stranger to casting a varied array of models for its shows.", "og": {"updated_time": "2018-02-13T14:33:25.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "This 10-year-old \u2018drag kid\u2019 just made his runway debut at New York Fashion Week", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/life-style/fashion/new-york-fashion-week-drag-kid-desmond-is-amazing-napoles-runway-debut-gypsy-sport-lgbt-pride-a8208466.html", "type": "article", "description": "As a boundary-breaking fashion brand that\u2019s known for its diverse representation, Gypsy Sport is no stranger to casting a varied array of models for its shows.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/13/13/esmond-amazing-gypsy-sport.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/13/13/esmond-amazing-gypsy-sport.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-13T14:33:25.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-02-13T14:33:25.000Z", "section": "Lifestyle", "subsection": "Fashion", "author_name": "Sarah Jones", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 391, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 4, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 0, "external_link_count": 0}, "date": "2018-02-13T14:33:25.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "This 10-year-old \u2018drag kid\u2019 just made his runway debut at New York Fashion Week", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "As a boundary-breaking fashion brand that\u2019s known for its diverse representation, Gypsy Sport is no stranger to casting a varied array of models for its shows.", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/13/13/esmond-amazing-gypsy-sport.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"fashion and style\",\"New York Fashion Week\",\"autumn winter 2018\",\"diversity\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518532405.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
