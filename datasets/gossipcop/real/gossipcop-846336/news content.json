LL hit me [up and] was like, \u2018Dude, I\u2019m telling you, it\u2019s time. You have no idea the love that\u2019s out there.\u2019 I was listening to L like, \u2018All right, I need to do it.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cNow I got the bug,\u201d Smith continued. \u201cI was on fire last night. It was the first time being on stage in a while. I blew my voice out a little \u2014 I do that all the time. I just can\u2019t contain myself on stage.\u201d\n\nAs for Jazzy Jeff, he said that his job is to rein in Smith when he gets \u201coverly excited.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the little man in his ear telling him to calm down, just slow down,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to have fun with it and a lot of it is making sure that you\u2019re loose and calm on stage.\u201d\n\nHowever, while the two of them are loving the tour and even debuted a new track, \u201cGet Lit,\u201d on Sunday, they said that this didn\u2019t mean there was going to be a Fresh Prince of Bel-Air reunion.\n\n\u201cStuff had to go really wrong for there to be a Fresh Prince reunion special,\u201d Smith said. \u201cLike, I don\u2019t know what would have to happen! Nah man, you can\u2019t touch stuff like that. It\u2019s so nostalgic for people \u2014 I\u2019m not going nowhere near that.\u201d", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=28052837&cv=4.4.0&cj=1", "https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thegrio-default-1080x608.jpg", "https://thegrio.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=90,gravity=auto,sharpen=1,metadata=none,format=auto,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/theGrio-BlackMade-Footer-Promo-Mobile.png", "https://thegrio.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=70,height=104,fit=crop,quality=90,gravity=auto,sharpen=1,metadata=none,format=auto,onerror=redirect/wp-content/themes/thegrio-child-theme/img/theGrio_G_Logo.svg", "https://thegrio.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=595,height=327,fit=crop,quality=90,gravity=auto,sharpen=1,metadata=none,format=auto,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Large_Logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thegrio-default-1080x608.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thegrio Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://thegrio.com/2017/08/29/will-smith-dj-jazzy-jeff-reunite/", "title": "Will Smith, DJ Jazzy Jeff reunite for first official show in 12 years", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Will Smith, DJ Jazzy Jeff reunite for first official show in 12 years", "description": "DJ Jazzy Jeff and Will Smith have reunited for their first official show in 12 years...", "url": "https://thegrio.com/2017/08/29/will-smith-dj-jazzy-jeff-reunite/", "site_name": "TheGrio", "image": {"identifier": "https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/thegrio-default-1080x608.jpg", "width": 1080, "height": 608, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theGrio/", "published_time": "2017-08-29T15:12:44+00:00", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "author": "TheGrio Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theGrio", "site": "@theGrio", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "TheGrio Staff", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Big-G-transparent-BG-300x300.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503979200.0, "source": "https://thegrio.com", "summary": ""}
