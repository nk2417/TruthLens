Every season of Game of Thrones has gotten underway in April, except for Season 3 (which started on March 31) and Season 7 (which premiered July 16).\n\nThrones' Season 7 finale aired August 27, 2017.\n\nBack in January, Bloys told TVLine that showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff \u2014 and not the network \u2014 were responsible for the delayed start of Season 8. \"It was based on when they felt that they could deliver a show that the are most proud of... I suppose we could've said to them, 'You must deliver by this date... But we've worked with them a long time and I trust them to tell us, 'This is the time we need to make it good.' So I don't know that it's a delay as much as it is 'This is the time required to deliver at the level that they think the fans expect.'\"", "images": ["https://www.tvline.com/img/TVLine-Icon-RGB-Default-Color.svg", "https://www.tvline.com/img/TVLine-Logo-RGB-Default-Color.svg", "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/news/game-of-thrones-season-8-premiere-date-april-2019-1000718/game-thrones-jon-sansa.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/news/game-of-thrones-season-8-premiere-date-april-2019-1000718/game-thrones-jon-sansa.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kimberly Roots"], "canonical_link": "https://www.tvline.com/news/game-of-thrones-season-8-premiere-date-april-2019-1000718/", "title": "'Game Of Thrones' Season 8 To Premiere In April 2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "thumbnail": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/news/game-of-thrones-season-8-premiere-date-april-2019-1000718/game-thrones-jon-sansa.jpg", "description": "Arya Stark had it right.
