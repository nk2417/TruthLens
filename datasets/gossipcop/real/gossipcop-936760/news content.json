She said that the liquid bandage New Skin was painfully applied after several of the takes. She said the stunt coordinator, who she did not name, told her the moleskin would be seen on camera.\n\n\u201cI looked like a mutant. My mom said, \u2018You\u2019ll never be able to wear an evening gown again!\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nThe stunt in question involved rolling off a tree branch and then hanging above the ground (she was harnessed to the branch to prevent falling), the actress recalled. Lilly said that she did the stunt multiple times, and each time more skin ripped from her forearms.\n\n\u201cI felt it was him saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to put you in your place for standing up to me,\u2019\u201d Lilly said of the stunt coordinator. \u201cIt was either cow to his power or hurt myself. I was in my twenties then. Now, I would probably back down.\u201d\n\nA rep for ABC, Lilly and studio Bad Robot did not immediately respond to TheWrap\u2019s request for comment on the alleged incident.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325_COVER-_IR_5x4.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/evangeline-lilly-lost.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/evangeline-lilly-lost.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ashley Boucher", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid", "Border-Radius Box-Shadow Rgba", "Rgba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/evangeline-lilly-remembers-injury-from-lost-stunt-i-looked-like-a-mutant/", "title": "Evangeline Lilly Blames \u2018Misogynistic\u2019 Stunt Coordinator for \u2018Lost\u2019 Set Injury", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Evangeline Lilly Blames 'Misogynistic' Stunt Coordinator for 'Lost' Set Injury", "description": "Actress says she was pressured into stunt that ripped skin from her forearms", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/evangeline-lilly-remembers-injury-from-lost-stunt-i-looked-like-a-mutant/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/evangeline-lilly-lost.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/png"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-18T17:52:18+00:00"}, "author": "Ashley Boucher", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Ashley Boucher", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "evangeline_lilly, lost", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526665938.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
