INFO 1/60\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be an awards show, though, without some tears, many of them shed by Simons, fashion\u2019s resident emo boy, who in just one season took home both the Menswear Designer of the Year and Womenswear Designer of the Year Award for his debut Fall 2017 collection at Calvin Klein\u2014a feat previously only previously accomplished by Calvin Klein himself, in 1993.\n\nIn accepting the first award, for menswear, Simons set a tone of sincerity for the evening. \u201cIf we as creatives can be an inspiration for how the world should look,\u201d Simons said, wiping at tears. \u201cI think that it\u2019s something we should take as a very important task in our existence.\u201d He also thanked \u201cmy man,\u201d a reference to Jean-Georges D\u2019Orazio, sharing that when they moved to New York knowing no one, they only had each other, inciting a chorus of \u201cAw\u2019s\u201d around the room.\n\nUpon accepting the Founder\u2019s Award, Pat McGrath, too, delivered touching remarks reflecting on her own climb up the ladder from working-class London. \u201cFashion is an industry where all the insiders are outsiders,\u201d she said in a much quoted line.\n\nAnna Wintour, editor in chief of Vogue and Cond\u00e9 Nast artistic director, choked up when honoring her late friend Franca Sozzani, before presenting a posthumous Fashion Icon award to Sozzani\u2019s son\u2014and Wintour\u2019s soon-to-be son-in-law\u2014 Francesco Carrozzini.\n\n\u201cAn eye for romance was one of Franca\u2019s editorial gifts,\u201d Wintour said haltingly. \u201cFranca\u2019s deep imagination drew on drama and a feeling that fashion meant more than just clothes.\u201d\n\nCFDA Awards 2017: From Rowan Blanchard and Hari Nef to the Olsen Twins, Here Are the Best Dressed Celebrities on the Red Carpet Chloe Grace Moritz, Sasha Lane, Hari Nef, and Rowan Blanchard wear Coach.

INFO 1/10\n\n\u201cWelcome to the inner sanctum of winningness,\u201d Kerry Washington, who had presented the Swarovski Award for Emerging Talent, said to Kim and Garcia as they entered the so-called \u201cWinner\u2019s Walk,\u201d a makeshift war room with a mini step-and-repeat for winners to pose with their statue.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a speech, but Laura still had her speech from last year, so she deleted a few names who are no longer part of our lives, and then added a couple, and then improvised. And I just rode on her coattails,\u201d Garcia said, fresh off the podium.\n\n\u201cOh god, it all went blank. I wasn\u2019t sure where to go, and I didn\u2019t know what I was going to say. I don\u2019t know what I said,\u201d said Stuart Vevers after winning Accessory Designer of the Year for his work at Coach. Luckily the hard part was over. \u201cI think I\u2019m going to get drunk now.\u201d\n\nFor some, the CFDAs are a night out with an old friend, for others, something of a supremely glamorous first date. \u201cI\u2019ve been wearing his designs for a long time, but we only finally met two weeks ago and it was stellar. It was cosmic,\u201d said Brit Marling on the red carpet of her date, Sies Marjan\u2019s Sander Lak.\n\nBlanchard ventured the carpet alone, clad in Coach and sequined eye makeup, having just had a glamorous date of her own: prom, where she attended alongside Yara Shahidi.\n\n\u201cIt was really fun! Our school is an online version, so it was really fun to go in person,\u201d she said. \u201cProm was weird, though, because I was the youngest person there because I was only a sophomore. They were all like, \u2018You\u2019re a baby,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re a year older than me.\u2019 That was sort of amusing, and they had a weird DJ, but it was fun.\u201d\n\nCFDA Awards 2017: See What Gigi Hadid, Priyanka Chopra and More Wore on the Red Carpet Gigi Hadid at the 2017 CFDA Fashion Awards at Hammerstein Ballroom on June 5, 2017 in New York City.

INFO 1/60\n\nAs if on cue, Elson spotted Blanchard, running up to gush. \u201cI\u2019m so lucky that my daughter has someone like you to look up to,\u201d she said. She also had someone she wanted to introduce her to: Gloria Steinem.\n\n\u201cMy heart is racing so fast right now,\u201d Blanchard said, as she approached the living legend. It was a feeling that resounded on the carpet and, later, inside the venue.\n\nThe feminist icon was being awarded with the Board of Directors Tribute, along with Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Planned Parenthood\u2019s Cecile Richards, and was easily the most popular woman in the venue. \u201cI think this is a group of very socially conscious people who are making beauty not guns,\u201d Steinem told W. \u201cI think the fashion industry have often been on the forefront of many different kinds of social change. There has been especially more consciousness about how are garments are produced and making sure they are ethically produced and create good jobs. And it\u2019s a sign of freedom. Oppressive regimes dictate uniforms, so clothing that is self-expression is democratic.\u201d\n\nThe trio of women closed out the night with a series of rousing speeches. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a feminist without being anti-racist, and vice versa,\u201d Steinem said. Echoed by Mon\u00e1e, who added, \u201cAs human beings it is our responsibility to take care of one another,\u201d a fitting conclusion to a particularly poignant evening.\n\nWith all the waterworks, perhaps Calvin Klein should make handkerchiefs next season? Surely Accessory Designer of the Year would go nicely with Simons\u2019 two other trophies.\n\nCFDA Awards: Rihanna, Gwyneth Paltrow, and 23 More of the Best Red Carpet Looks of All Time Rihanna was a showstopper in the 2014 awards wearing a custom Adam Selman gown that left little to the imagination.
