The California-born Rivera was 43.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pressure to represent someone who\u2019s an icon in the Latin community,\u201d says Celaya, 34. \u201cThe fans that are out there, diehard fans, they still to this day protect her and love her.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s a big responsibility to get it right, and my role as an actor is to really capture the essence of Jenni,\u201d Celaya adds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a role of a lifetime.\u201d\n\nCelaya studied at the University of Arizona before getting into acting. Born to Mexican parents, she\u2019s appeared in telenovelas before, but has spent the past few years appearing in American productions including \u201cCastle\u201d and \u201cCriminal Minds: Beyond Borders.\u201d\n\nJenni Rivera\n\n\u201cFor the right role, I will go back,\u201d she says of her decision to play Rivera.\n\n\u201cHer fans have always known that, through her music and through her lyrics, she was this woman that wouldn\u2019t take any b.s. from anybody,\u201d the actress adds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to learn why she became this way, why she started writing this kind of music, why her fan base is predominantly women who have gone through so many things and look up to her.\n\n\u201cTo this day, they still look up to her.\u201d\n\nFor more VIVA articles and the latest on Latino lifestyle, entertainment, sports, health, fashion, business and community news, click here.", "images": ["data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NYDN-LOGO-WHITE-J.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/NYDN-LOGO-WHITE-J.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ray Monell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/07/14/playing-jenni-rivera-in-telemundo-novela-is-role-of-a-lifetime/", "title": "Playing Jenni Rivera in Telemundo novela is \u2018role of a lifetime\u2019", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Ray Monell", "canonical": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/07/14/playing-jenni-rivera-in-telemundo-novela-is-role-of-a-lifetime/"}, "description": "Angelica Celaya is well aware of the significance of playing ionic singer Jenni Rivera in \"Mariposa de Barrio.\u201d", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Playing Jenni Rivera in Telemundo novela is \u2018role of a lifetime\u2019", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2017/07/14/playing-jenni-rivera-in-telemundo-novela-is-role-of-a-lifetime/", "description": "Angelica Celaya is well aware of the significance of playing iconic singer Jenni Rivera.
