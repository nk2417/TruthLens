Did you get engaged? Oh my gosh, congratulations! I wanna send a gift!' But I was really being nosey and he didn't text me back,\" Brown said, disappointed.\n\nUltimately, it was Porowski who's quiet, sage wisdom summed up their defense of Davidson and Grande's engagement the best: \"Sometimes, you just know.\"\n\nBack in March, France took Davidson on a shopping adventure through New York City to help him step up his style game, in a short video shared by Saturday Night Live. However, it seems their friendship has stayed strong.\n\n\"I just went shopping with him a couple days ago,\" France said, although he didn't reveal whether or not he'd be helping him shop for wedding clothes whenever that day comes.\n\nRecently, ET sat down with the Fab Five to talk about the upcoming second season of Queer Eye, and the stars dished on the most interesting fan mail they've ever gotten, and revealed which celebs they've love to have on as guest experts.\n\nCheck out the video below to hear more.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/fabfive_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-06/pete_1.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/fabfive_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-12/gettyimages-1063321470.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-06/eto_ariana_grande_pete_davidson_061218.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-03/tan_france_pete_davidson_getty.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/fabfive_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/queer-eye-fab-five-defend-ariana-grande-and-pete-davidsons-quick-engagement-104866", "title": "'Queer Eye' Fab Five Defend Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson's Quick Engagement", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/fabfive_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The stars of the Netflix reboot shared their support for the couple on Sunday's 'Watch What Happens Live.'", "title": "'Queer Eye' Fab Five Defend Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson's Quick Engagement", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/queer-eye-fab-five-defend-ariana-grande-and-pete-davidsons-quick-engagement-104866", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The stars of the Netflix reboot shared their support for the couple on Sunday's 'Watch What Happens Live.'", "twitter": {"description": "The stars of the Netflix reboot shared their support for the couple on Sunday's 'Watch What Happens Live.'", "title": "'Queer Eye' Fab Five Defend Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson's Quick Engagement", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/queer-eye-fab-five-defend-ariana-grande-and-pete-davidsons-quick-engagement-104866", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/fabfive_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "'Queer Eye' Fab Five Defend Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson's Quick Engagement | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, Queer Eye, Pete Davidson, Ariana Grande", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
