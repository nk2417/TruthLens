She worked on Wall Street in New York, and I had like six shows [around New York in 2015]. It was around then, and we reconnected. I went on tour again, and then I went to Taylor\u2019s 4th of July party. I was texting [Seaborn], and she was like, \u2018I\u2019m in Rhode Island at a 4th of July party,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018So am I.\u2019 I kinda said to Taylor, \u2018Can I invite one of my old schoolmates?\u2019 The rest is history.\u201d The British singer even references their anniversary on his guest verse of Swift's new single \"End Game,\" in which he raps: \"After the storm, something was born on the Fourth of July.\"\n\n02 of 13 On Taylor's Stamp of Approval Kevin Mazur/WireImage Since Swift essentially provided the setting for Sheeran and Seaborn's love to blossom, it should come as no surprise that the singer has given the pair two thumbs up. \u201cHer and Taylor have hung out without me quite a few times; I think they have gal chats,\u201d he told PEOPLE last year. \u201cI don\u2019t know what they get up to \u2014 talking about cats or whatever.\u201d In a behind-the-scenes clip from their \"End Game\" video, Swift said of Seaborn: \"Ugh, she is so cool.\" To commemorate Sheeran and Seaborn's first anniversary, Swift even created a punny marquee that read, \"Happy 1st Ed-iver-Cherry!\" \"I'm still excited about it,\" Swift added in the clip. \"It took me so long to think of both of your names...\"\n\n03 of 13 On How They Built a Solid Foundation Calvin Harris/Instagram After a difficult few years in the spotlight, Sheeran took a year off from work and away from social media. During that time, he and Seaborn \u2014 who spent Labor Day weekend 2015 in Las Vegas with Swift's then-boyfriend Calvin Harris \u2014 built a strong foundation for their relationship. \"\u201cIt\u2019s quite weird being a touring \u2018celebrity\u2019 because people assume you\u2019re living the best f\u2014ing life in the world, but you don\u2019t really get to live any life because you work the whole time. I got to the end of [my last tour], and I was like \u2018F\u2014, I\u2019m 25 and haven\u2019t really lived.' I needed to have a year off and spend it with friends and family and Cherry and actually become a human being rather than a touring celebrity,\" Sheeran told PEOPLE in August 2018. \u201cThis has been the first time I\u2019ve actually had the time to fall in love properly,\u201d Sheeran told Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio last year. \u201cSo the catalyst of taking a year off was also the fact that my partner quit her job in New York \u2014 which she\u2019s now got back in London, which is really cool \u2014 but we were just basically like, let\u2019s quit our jobs and have a year of forming a tight bond. So we went traveling and spent every day for a year together,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019ve probably had three days apart from her in the last year\u2026but we\u2019re very, very strong. I\u2019ve never been happier. I\u2019ve never been more comfortable. I\u2019ve never been more inspired. I feel like everything\u2019s fallen into place, and it\u2019s fallen into place because I\u2019ve given it the time to fall into place,\" he added.\n\n04 of 13 On How She Helped Him Confront Addiction Felipe Ramales/Splash \u201cI think you need to, when you get into the industry, adjust to it \u2014 and I didn\u2019t adjust because I was constantly working on tour. And all the pitfalls that people read about, I just found myself slipping into all of them. Mostly, like, substance abuse,\u201d Sheeran said on The Jonathan Ross Show in October. \u201cI didn\u2019t really notice it was happening. It just started gradually happening, and then some people took me to one side and were like, \u2018Calm yourself down\u2019\u2026 It\u2019s all fun to begin with, it all starts off as a party and then you\u2019re doing it on your own and it\u2019s not, so that was a wake-up call and taking a year off,\u201d he said. Of Seaborn, he added: \u201cWe live together now, and I think that was a real help grounding me. I was a 25 year old in the music industry on tour so I just needed someone to balance me out.\u201d\n\n05 of 13 On Writing His Hit \"Perfect\" About Her FatPapSlim/Splash After a crazy night at friend James Blunt's house in Ibiza with Seaborn, Sheeran wrote the chart-topping lovesick ballad. \u201cWe got really hammered and took our shoes off and danced on his lawn and then jumped in the pool,\u201d Sheeran told Radio.com of the track. \u201cAnd then the next day I was like, \u2018That\u2019s a cool story,\u2019 so I put it in a song.\u201d\n\n06 of 13 On Wanting to Start a Family Hewitt/SilverHub/REX/Shutterstock \u201cI actually think the meaning of life is to start a family and pass on knowledge to them and be loved and be loving, so that is definitely on the cards,\u201d Sheeran told PEOPLE last year. \u201cBut not any time soon. I don\u2019t have any time anytime soon. It\u2019s something I really want to put a lot of time into, as well. I don\u2019t want to be constantly on the road trying to raise a child.\u201d In January 2017, he told Beats 1's Zane Lowe he \"massively\" wants kids. \"I wanted to be a dad, like, last year. I\u2019m ready, let\u2019s go \u2014 tour bus babies, little fat, chubby babies that just walk around.\u201d\n\n07 of 13 On Co-Parenting Their Cats Ed Sheeran/Instagram Sheeran and Seaborn are the proud parents of two felines: Dorito and Calippo. \u201cMe and Cherry literally had them from birth, and they think that we\u2019re their mother, from our warmth and our smells,\u201d Sheeran told PEOPLE in 2017 of their furry friends, whom they welcomed into the family in 2016. After the adventurous Dorito dove out of their three-story window last year, Seaborn proved her prowess as a resourceful mama. \u201cCherry opened the window to let some air in, and she just jumped out,\u201d Sheeran said of the incident. \" \u201cCherry obviously freaked out; she\u2019s in this closed-off garden that we can\u2019t get into because it\u2019s not our garden. So Cherry tied all of her scarves together onto a laundry basket and put food in it and lowered it down and picked her back up. What an idiot, though!\u201d\n\n08 of 13 On Their Relatable, Low-Key Holiday Plans Palace Lee/INSTARimages \u201cWe bought What Do You Meme?\" Sheeran told PEOPLE in December of their casual holiday plans. \u201cI\u2019m going to play that with her family. She only lives a couple of miles away from me. So I usually have Christmas at my house and drive over to hers.\u201d In addition to playing the card game \u2014 during which players match a photo caption with the funniest meme \u2014 said they would enjoy some rowdy fun, too. \u201cWe do 12 Pubs of Christmas, which is a pub crawl and you have a pint at every pub,\u201d he added.\n\n09 of 13 On Popping the Question Ed Sheeran/Instagram \u201cGot myself a fianc\u00e9e just before new year,\u201d he captioned his Jan. 20, 2018 Instagram post, in which he announced their engagement. \"We are very happy and in love, and our cats are chuffed as well.\"\n\n10 of 13 On the Engagement Ring She Made Him David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock On Feb. 19, 2018, Sheeran sparked rumors he and Seaborn had secretly wed when he performed in London wearing a band on his ring finger; he also wore the ring two days later at the Brit Awards and was spotted with it grabbing dinner with his fianc\u00e9e after the show. On the Brits red carpet, Sheeran told the British talk show Lorraine that it is a commitment ring. \u201cI never saw why men didn\u2019t wear engagement rings. It\u2019s the same commitment either way,\" he said. \"Cherry made it for me herself out of silver clay. I really like it.\u201d\n\n11 of 13 On Keeping Their Relationship Under Wraps Sheeran and Seaborn have kept their romance low-key \u2014 but she does appear in his new Apple Music documentary, Songwriter, very briefly. \u201cI was against having her in the documentary just because I like to keep my personal life private, but I think it\u2019s such a split second of it and it does just capture what she\u2019s like,\u201d he says about including his Duke-educated fianc\u00e9e in the documentary. \u201cIt\u2019s nice for people to see a little bit of that.\u201d\n\n12 of 13 On Their Intimate Date Nights Ed Sheeran/Instagram \"[We] just went to Napa and ate at [Michelin-starred restaurant] the French Laundry. I would love to be a foodie, but it\u2019s more about going out on dates. We went to a Mexican restaurant afterward for $20 and had just as much fun,\" Sheeran (above, in a Dec. 18, 2018 Instagram post) told PEOPLE in August 2018.", "images":
