The duo have walked together in shows from Victoria\u2019s Secret to Chanel, but they\u2019ve also cultivated entirely separate careers: Bella is the face of Bulgari and Dior beauty, while Gigi is the face of Tommy Hilfiger and Maybelline. And as far as their relationship is concerned, those differences don\u2019t matter.\n\n\u201cMost of the time our markets are completely different, and if we get booked on a job and she gets it or I get it, we\u2019re both happy for each other,\u201d Bella tells Harper\u2019s Bazaar Arabia (the inaugural cover of which Gigi landed in March). \u201cThere are enough jobs in the world for both of us. There\u2019s no reason for us to be mad at each other or competitive. So if she gets it, then good for her. We\u2019re in the family, so she can buy me a pair of shoes.\u201d\n\nBella once said for herself that she can\u2019t believe she gets to experience her career with her \u201cbest friend\u201d Gigi by her side. After all, it does come with its perks \u2014 like wearing crazy jewelry, as Bella does as the face of Bulgari. \u201cBesides the security that has to follow me around everywhere?\u201d she says about how she feels about wearing huge diamonds. \u201cUp until this year I never wore jewelry like that. It\u2019s such an honor. And I love Bulgari, so it\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: Supermodel Sisters! Bella and Gigi Hadid\u2019s Best Runway Moments\n\nThe diamonds aren\u2019t the only thing she has at her disposal these days \u2013 she\u2019s also showered in designer clothing, handbags and shoes, which, she says, is a sharp contrast to the way she grew up.\n\n\u201cI never spent money,\u201d she says of her pre-modeling years. \u201cIt still to this day freaks me out to spend money. It would make me happy to buy a really cute $5 T-shirt instead of a designer piece. I never bought anything designer until I was 18 and could buy it on my own. I bought my first pair of Louboutins and that was a very big moment for me. People always think that my parents would buy us stuff. My mom never bought me anything designer. My dad would buy me little things that are more meaningful than a designer purse. I would rather have riding boots. That was what made me so happy.\u201d\n\nBut as fun as the job is, she says, isn\u2019t the most fulfilling. \u201cIt\u2019s not very giving, being a model, it doesn\u2019t warm your heart,\u201d she says, adding \u201cIt\u2019s not as rewarding for the soul as most things.\u201d\n\nWhich is why she tries to do as much good as she can, specifically when it comes to bullying \u2014 an issue that she\u2019s dealt with personally throughout the years.\n\n\u201cAll of these teenagers need to know that you\u2019re you and that\u2019s the best thing you can be,\u201d she says. \u201cThe hardest part is being judged, and that\u2019s what they talk to me about. It\u2019s really sad because it doesn\u2019t happen just in America or just in Europe, it happens everywhere in the world. Bullying is a crazy thing.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think of Bella\u2019s take on the industry?
