I will never just order food to take a photo and then not eat it.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/gSaqXPrH_uzPaq9cJqf07SPvaZQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sza-iheart-radio-061725-973cb029d333430caad2e65394430b7c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/cJXcYyRQpQEBXHvsvwMXMQvKAqM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/surviving-mormonism-with-heather-gay-2-111125-3bca5a8149344f77a5b8568e6f7153c1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/yFr2dXd7aGzevGScrMci4UIcfpM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Shay-Mitchell-kids-skincare-299-110425-e4f4976f88814b3ba9298d823fb18d0f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Uo8iLTyanrj7eNHYmSXZHwHJbxY=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Spencer-Lofranco-112025-56efb2cd379b4817ac0f4d3b10fb37f3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/a5BgwBQzCnrSrSuKYOjNqXPjRP8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/richard-gere-101425-7d3b4645395d402781a948173314c068.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/kOBeAuBq6qD--GjSta8CH4KnZWA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spongebob-the-search-for-squarepants-4-111325-a95cf34b84b54356b25597b470e02150.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/zU-rq5sM73sCG0VtAH4yNvHEfFU=/343x228/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sza-iheart-radio-061725-973cb029d333430caad2e65394430b7c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Jcp5SQMnR2Je90BQo6DgCWnaNME=/343x228/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hilary-duff-therapuss-110625-2-d00f370909204d0ea346462a152ada3a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/djP0TRoy9vuIloEmCmuanA0N1NY=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/quadruple-amputation2-112025-c05ec8d5ca3f44488ab8fd45eb9d724d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/hVHPvZMYgug3c8WXGTa9ywg9-FE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jennifer-Lawrence-Donald-Trump-110425-3c506209db004aee8eb5a420c487d425.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/jWG_cLyKvcCIQuRY3Jar-3Z2nhE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/eddie-murphy-yul-brynner-111025-b2727159a2ca40829dee3c0b91f47b05.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tkKsJk5S9rvVurEm_p4XBX3pcNg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(616x0:618x2)/shay-mitchell-99c7e0bbf8b24a0a9740b252bfe5127f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/RKPlo6triPeAN-rtXRhRvK2bP7s=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Billie-Eilish-Elon-Musk-111325-48bab1fcf682443897ce1ab0ff5b2ffe.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/VHPzfx6FVBZDkvRn2nM-619rhFA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/richard-gere-homer-111425-6e658fe725574472a93c478fe6ec8a36.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7iFv4Mo6-HS1kOChZSABFWkocUE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/A-GRAMMY-SALUTE-TO-CYNDI-LAUPER-AT-THE-HOLLYWOOD-101725-59d991f8a3d64429a2cf899ebfbdb44b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/oEI7NYbc95S_LYxdycSCH88GOXU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shay-mitchell-handm-musical-event-112624-644edb0bd1784a86afb80a2b84299bf9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/KtgpEPLHE2nNf-_4zhq9VAMjEYY=/343x228/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jonathan-Bailey-111625-801f2d08b6414f4793a9c41e63d3eb87.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-Z007UsSaKr1oDuJ707Ld9Y0MiM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/suni-lee-1-102025-f9e8b7555b9d49a1b9ef62148e00f431.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/JuPHmvovpM_Q4Si_tg1sM9teyyo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/moana-trailer5-111725-2e01fbcbdddc42c180e7c9becd4b6cb1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3G0Q5f2M0MKbeOkEXkqmzO8_5fI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/hilary-duff-therapuss-110625-2-d00f370909204d0ea346462a152ada3a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/bZmGXn3K6QTMep7gwl0CGwOVoA8=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/david-sharon-schoo-leaving-court-102825-31cfe4a2ae50417c99a42136edcfda93.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/i5257qTCbW8c8A77-f85DCI7VB4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jonathan-Bailey-111625-801f2d08b6414f4793a9c41e63d3eb87.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3vbd7TjjAdRFi35_rrJ406AM5tA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Rina-Sawayama-sabrina-carpenter-saturday-night-live-102025-6fd41c72425e47beb4c5a50f39c95aa5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/jIK60Q2ZLv7v9GA22X6VPlAmlvU=/800x533/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jellyroll-instagram2-112025-8ebe824d77cc42eda053a3e687ae8d0f.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/tkKsJk5S9rvVurEm_p4XBX3pcNg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(616x0:618x2)/shay-mitchell-99c7e0bbf8b24a0a9740b252bfe5127f.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "Maria Pasquini Is The Senior News Editor For The Human Interest Vertical At People.
