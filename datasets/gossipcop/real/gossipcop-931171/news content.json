She was educated at St Andrew's School and Marlborough College before earning a degree in art history at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, where she met Prince William in 2001 and graduated in 2005. She held several jobs and pursued charity work before their engagement was announced in November 2010. She became Duchess of Cambridge by her marriage on 29 April 2011 at Westminster Abbey. The couple have three children: George, Charlotte, and Louis. In early 2024, she was diagnosed with cancer, underwent chemotherapy, and resumed duties later that year.\n\nFollowing her marriage, Catherine has undertaken royal duties and commitments in support of the British monarch. She has represented the royal family on official overseas tours and has played a significant role in various charitable activities by undertaking projects through the Royal Foundation, with her charity work primarily focusing on issues surrounding early childhood care, addiction, and art.

To encourage people to discuss their mental health problems, she envisioned the mental health awareness campaign Heads Together, which she launched with William and her brother-in-law Harry in April 2016.\n\nCatherine's relationship with the media has been closely scrutinised, particularly regarding her efforts to maintain privacy amid significant media attention and public interest. The media have referred to her impact on British and American fashion as the \"Kate Middleton effect\". Time listed her as one of the most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012 and 2013. On 9 September 2022, she became Princess of Wales when William was created Prince of Wales by his father, King Charles III.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nCatherine Elizabeth Middleton was born on 9 January 1982 at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading into an upper-middle-class family with ties to the landed gentry.[7] Her parents, Michael Middleton and Carole (n\u00e9e Goldsmith),[9] were a flight dispatcher and flight attendant at British Airways, respectively.

The property has remained a private retreat for the couple in subsequent years.[47] In 2004 the couple briefly split but later rekindled their relationship.[48]\n\nIn November 2006, Middleton commenced part-time work for twelve months as an accessories buyer with the clothing chain Jigsaw.[50] She also worked as a project manager in the family business, where she was responsible for the website and catalogue.[51][52]\n\nMiddleton attended William's Passing Out Parade at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in December 2006.[53][54] In April 2007, they ended their relationship.[55] It was subsequently reported that the couple had reconciled.[57] In May 2008, Middleton attended the wedding of William's cousin Peter Phillips to Autumn Kelly in place of William, where she met Queen Elizabeth II for the first time.[58][59]\n\nMiddleton also attended the Order of the Garter procession at Windsor Castle in June 2008, where William was made a Royal Knight of the Garter.[60] In July 2008, she was a guest at the wedding of Lady Rose Windsor and George Gilman while William was away on military operations in the Caribbean, serving aboard HMS Iron Duke.[61] In June 2010, the couple moved into a cottage on the Bodorgan Estate in Anglesey, Wales, where William resided during his RAF search and rescue training and subsequent career.[62][63] Before her marriage, Middleton lived with her sister Pippa in an apartment owned by their parents in Chelsea, London.[64]\n\nMarriage and children\n\nMiddleton and William became engaged in October 2010, at a remote alpine cabin on Mount Kenya[65] during a ten-day trip to the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy.[66][67] Clarence House announced the engagement on 16 November that year.[69] William gave her the engagement ring that had belonged to his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.

Camilla Tominey of The Daily Telegraph described her as \"the monarchy's greatest asset\", while Petronella Wyatt of the same paper called her \"the jewel in the crown\".[296][297][298] Rhonda Garelick of The New York Times also noted her ability to balance modernity with traditional royal norms.[299] On Catherine's 40th birthday, her aides told The Times she avoids PR advice and \"will never do something because she thinks the media will like it\".[300] Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, her and William's former private secretary, said she has \"an almost old-fashioned, Queen Mother attitude to drama \u2013 she just doesn't do it.\"[300] She has been described as influential by The Times who noted that like Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, and King Charles III and Queen Camilla, she and William are \"a good double act.\"[301]\n\nTime magazine listed Catherine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011, 2012, and 2013.[302] In 2011 and 2024 she was one of the runners-up for the magazine's Person of the Year award.[303][304] From 2023 to 2025, The Independent included Catherine on its \"Influence List\".[305] In December 2022, she was found to be the second most liked member of the royal family by the statistics and polling company YouGov,[306] while an Ipsos favourability poll in April 2023 ranked her first.[307] In April 2024, YouGov ranked her as the most popular royal.[308] That year, Catherine was the most searched person on Google Search in the United Kingdom and the second globally.[309][310] In May 2025, Catherine was named to the Time 100 Health list for her cancer awareness work.[311] That month, she and William featured on the inaugural Time 100 Philanthropy list.[312] The Royal Horticultural Society also launched a rose named Catherine's Rose, bred by Harkness Roses, in her honour to support the Royal Marsden Hospital.[313] In June, she and William topped Tatler's social power index.[314]\n\nPrivacy and the media\n\nThe death of Diana, Princess of Wales, while being chased by the paparazzi in 1997 has shaped Catherine and William's guarded stance towards the media.[315][316] They have repeatedly asked for privacy when off-duty.[316]\n\nIn April 2004, The Sun published pictures of Middleton with William at a ski resort, identifying her as his girlfriend.[317] Following her graduation, she was frequently targeted by paparazzi and complained of harassment and intrusive media presence outside her home.[318][319][320]\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006, Middleton's phone was reportedly hacked 155 times by the News of the World, according to its former royal editor Clive Goodman, during a wider phone hacking scandal targeting the royal family.[321] In 2006 her lawyers issued further warnings following the publication of unauthorised photographs taken during a shopping trip.[322]\n\nIn January 2007, increased media attention around Middleton's 25th birthday led to legal warnings from Prince William, Prince Charles, and her lawyers over press harassment.[323][319] Some newspapers agreed to stop using paparazzi images.[324] In March, a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) over a photo taken through harassment led to a settlement and warning.[325][326] In July, MPs criticised the PCC for failing to protect her from \"persistent harassment\".[327]\n\nIn 2010 Middleton pursued a privacy claim against two agencies and the photographer Niraj Tanna over tennis photographs taken during Christmas 2009. The case concluded with \u00a35,000 in damages, legal costs, and an apology.[328][329] In 2011 close associates of the private investigator Jonathan Rees alleged that he had targeted Middleton during her relationship with Prince William.[330]\n\nIn May 2011, the Middleton family complained to the PCC after photographs of Catherine and her family in swimwear during a 2006 holiday were published in several newspapers.[331] The family argued that the images breached privacy and the editors' code of practice. In September, a deal was reached for the photos to be removed from the newspapers' websites and not published again.[332]\n\nIn September 2012, the French edition of Closer, Italian magazine Chi and the Irish Daily Star published topless photos of Catherine sunbathing at Ch\u00e2teau d'Autet.[333][334] William and Catherine filed a criminal complaint and civil suit in Nanterre.[335] A court granted an injunction banning further publication and launched a criminal inquiry.[336] In 2017 Closer was fined \u20ac100,000, and its editor and owner \u20ac45,000 each.[337]\n\nIn December 2012, Australian radio hosts Michael Christian and Mel Greig impersonated Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles in a call to King Edward VII's Hospital, where Catherine was being treated for hyperemesis gravidarum. They obtained information from a nurse on her ward. After a public backlash and hospital inquiry, Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who transferred the call, died by suicide.[338] The hosts later apologised.[339]\n\nWith William being photographed by members of the press during their 2016 royal tour of Canada\n\nIn February 2013, Chi published photos of Catherine's exposed pregnant belly, taken during a holiday on the private island of Mustique. The British press declined to publish them.[340] In October 2014, Catherine and William issued a legal warning to a freelance photographer for \"harassing and following\" their son George and his nanny.[341] In August 2015, Kensington Palace released a letter describing the media's \"dangerous\" efforts to photograph George and Charlotte.[342]\n\nIn March 2019, the royal family issued social media guidelines following online abuse directed at Catherine and her sister-in-law Meghan.[343] In May 2020, Kensington Palace criticised a Tatler article about Catherine as inaccurate, leading the magazine to amend its online version after legal pressure.[344]\n\nIn March 2024, the Associated Press, AFP, Reuters and Getty Images withdrew a Mother's Day photograph of Catherine and her children due to concerns over digital manipulation.[345] Catherine later admitted to editing the image and apologised for the confusion.[346] The incident occurred shortly before she revealed her cancer diagnosis and treatment.[347] Later that month, the London Clinic launched an investigation after reports that staff had attempted to access her private medical records.[348]\n\nIn October 2025, Prince Harry named Catherine and William in his court case against Associated Newspapers, asserting that private investigators had been employed to collect information on them in the past, including Catherine\u2019s mobile phone number and other personal details.[349] Later that month, she and William won a privacy case in France against Paris Match over unauthorised photos from a family ski trip in the Alps.[350]\n\nTitles, styles, and honours\n\nTitles and styles\n\nUpon her marriage in April 2011, Catherine became a Princess of the United Kingdom, as well as Duchess of Cambridge, Countess of Strathearn, and Baroness Carrickfergus; she also received the style of Royal Highness.[351][352] She was formally known as \"Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge\" except in Scotland, where she was instead called \"Her Royal Highness the Countess of Strathearn\".[353]\n\nQueen Elizabeth II died on 8 September 2022, and Catherine's father-in-law succeeded as Charles III.[354] Catherine became Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Rothesay.[355][356] Thus, she was briefly referred to by the title \"Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge\".[357] The following day, on 9 September 2022, the King announced William's appointment as Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, thereby making Catherine Princess of Wales and Countess of Chester. She has since been known as \"Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales\", and as \"Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Rothesay\" in Scotland.[358][359]\n\nHonours\n\nCatherine is a Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO),[360] a Royal Companion of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH),[361] and a recipient of the Royal Family Order of Elizabeth II[362] and the Royal Family Order of Charles III.[363]\n\nAncestry\n\nCatherine's father, Michael, is the son of Peter Middleton, who, along with their Middleton forebears, were from Leeds, West Yorkshire. The historian Robert Lacey describes Michael Middleton as having aristocratic kinship; his grandmother, Olive Christiana Middleton, was close to her second cousin Baroness Airedale (1868\u20131942).[365][366] Both Catherine's paternal great-grandmother Olive Middleton (n\u00e9e Lupton) and her first-cousin-once-removed Baroness von Schunck (n\u00e9e Kate Lupton) grew up at Potternewton Hall Estate, the seat of the Lupton family, who are described as landed gentry and, as such, were invited to the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary in 1911.[367][368][369] Four successive generations of Catherine's ancestors had lived at Potternewton Hall Estate: Catherine's great-grandmother Olive Middleton; her father, politician Francis Martineau Lupton; his mother, educator Frances Elizabeth Lupton; and her father, epidemiologist and surgeon Thomas Michael Greenhow.[370][371][372] Other paternal ancestors include Sir Thomas Fairfax and his wife Anne Gascoigne, who was a descendant of Edward III.[369][373]\n\nCatherine's maternal ancestors, the Harrisons, were working-class labourers and miners from Sunderland and County Durham who worked in the pits owned by the Bowes-Lyon family.[375] Ancestors through her maternal line include Sir Thomas Conyers, 9th Baronet, who was a descendant of Edward IV through his illegitimate daughter Elizabeth Plantagenet.[376]\n\nBibliography\n\nBook contributions\n\nAuthored articles and letters\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources", "images":
