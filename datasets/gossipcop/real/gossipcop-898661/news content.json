However, she still couldn\u2019t get it right but found a different way to pronounce it wrong, which angered Corden. He then tried to get her to say Hallelujah out loud in conversation, but she refused to say the actual word.\n\nThroughout the video, Wiig transformed \u201cHallelujah\u201d to \u201cHollaback girl,\u201d \u201cHalle Berry,\u201d \u201cHickory Farms,\u201d \u201cHow are you\u201d and \u201cHappy Doo Dee,\u201d among others.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who will bring about world peace, but it won\u2019t be us,\u201d Corden said after the final straw. \u201cI cannot bear this cross any longer.\u201d\n\n\u201cJames,\u201d Wiig said, trying to calm him down. \u201cDon\u2019t let ISIS win.\u201d\n\nIn the end, she got it right, and harmonizing with a choir commenced \u2014 but Corden got a weird look on his face and realized that the choir was singing, \u201cHello Julia\u201d instead of \u201cHallelujah.\u201d And it was all Wiig\u2019s fault.\n\nWatch the video above.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/mark-ruffalo-martha-plimpton-e1757028714396.jpg?fit=300%2C169&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?resize=150%2C150&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CordenWiig.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/seth-meyers-closer-look.jpg?fit=300%2C169&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325_COVER-_IR_5x4.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?fit=53%2C58&quality=80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CordenWiig.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Film Editor", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/kristen-wiig-hilariously-butchers-hallelujah-duet-with-james-corden-video/", "title": "Kristen Wiig Hilariously Butchers \u2018Hallelujah\u2019 Duet With James Corden (Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kristen Wiig Hilariously Butchers 'Hallelujah' Duet With James Corden (Video)", "description": "\"I don't know who will bring about world peace, but it won't be us,\" Corden says when Wiig repeatedly messes up", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/kristen-wiig-hilariously-butchers-hallelujah-duet-with-james-corden-video/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/CordenWiig.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2017-12-07T16:45:49+00:00"}, "author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "james-corden, kristen_wiig, late_late_show, leonard_cohen", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "tv, videos", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512665149.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
