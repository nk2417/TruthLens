Blaine enjoys being a bad guy and makes it look cool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s Johnny Rotting,\u201d said Anders in a phone conversation ahead of the finale. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit of a rocker zombie, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\nFor Anders, Blaine is the latest role in a long line of bad guys that began with the J.J. Abrams \u201cAlias,\u201d in which he portrayed the ruthless criminal Julian Sark. Since then, he has played villainous characters in \u201cHeroes,\u201d \u201cThe Vampire Diaries\u201d and \u201cOnce Upon a Time.\u201d Hero Complex chatted with Anders about Blaine\u2019s influences, \u201ciZombie\u2019s\u201d success and what\u2019s next for his character.\n\nWhat drew you to the role initially?\n\nWhat drew me to the role was the humor of it. They were calling it a zom-com-rom-dram, and I\u2019d never seen anything or read anything like it. And of course I knew of [series co-creator] Rob Thomas from his years of \u201cVeronica Mars\u2019 and \u201cParty Down,\u201d and I know he\u2019s very adept at humor. And for most of my career, I hadn\u2019t been allowed to do humor. And that pilot script was a real page turner, and I was laughing the whole way, and there were some cringe-worthy moments. But yeah, overall, it was the funny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI feel like we strike a good balance between the drama and the gore and the comedy. It\u2019s such a fun thing to play with.\n\nAt WonderCon, you talked about how it was a role that really had you chewing the scenery.\n\nPer Mr. T, Rob Thomas\u2019s instructions, I was told to chew as much scenery as possible, brains included. It\u2019s a lot of fun to be told to go further. It\u2019s always better to go too far than too little, because you can always bring it back a little bit. In the character breakdown, they said they had an idea for Blaine to be like James Spader in \u201cPretty in Pink,\u201d and when I read it, I was like, \u201cHe sounds a little more like Spader from \u2018Less Than Zero.\u2019\u201d So I tried to find the balance between \u201cPink\u201d and \u201cZero,\u201d and I hope I bring an element of Spader to it, because that\u2019s what Rob wanted, but at this point, I think, I\u2019ve made it my own.\n\nDo you ever feel silly playing such an arch character?\n\nSure, there\u2019s a lot of mustache-twirling. But this character is as close to me as I\u2019ve probably ever played, oddly, crazily enough. Because I think they really write to our strengths so well. They got to know us, and they write for us, within the confines of the characters. I feel like I\u2019m a sweet guy. I\u2019m my mother\u2019s son. I\u2019m not as nefarious as Blaine, but I am a little cocky.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe\u2019s kind of like a rock star zombie.\n\nRight, right, he\u2019s Johnny Rotting. That was cool as we put together the wardrobe and you get into the makeup and dye the hair and you start to move a little different. He\u2019s a bit of a rocker zombie, isn\u2019t he?\n\nSo you don\u2019t have to wear a wig like Rose does.\n\nSadly, no. She has a lot of trouble with the wig -- it\u2019s itchy, it moves on her, it can cause her a lot of torment. But I have to go into the salon every month, once a month, to get my roots dyed. And while it looks great for the character, it\u2019s become a poor life choice, because my hair, when it\u2019s dyed, it starts coming out in droves. It starts snowing on my head sometimes. So we\u2019re trying to come up with solutions. My manager contacted James Marsters\u2019 manager, because he played Spike for so many years, dying his hair, and James Marsters said to use Sweet\u2019N Low in the mixture. We\u2019re trying to come up with answers, but I do have to suffer through the bleach.\n\nDo you have a sense of your character\u2019s trajectory? Do you think he\u2019s going to have a multiple-seasons-long arc?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThrough this season, it\u2019s all going to come to a head by the finale between Liv and Blaine. But the fans? The fans are really calling out for that Spike-and-Buffy relationship, the love-and-hate type thing that they had through that wonderful series. So hopefully in season 2 they can explore that. I think they\u2019re going to have to work together. Much to Liv\u2019s chagrin she\u2019ll have to work with Blaine, because he has done nothing but terrible so far.\n\nHe has a fun posse working for him now.\n\nYeah, the \u201czarmy,\u201d the zombie army. They\u2019re some big cats, and they do wonderful work. They play dumb so well. It\u2019s just fun to work with them. Aleks [Paunovic], who plays Julien, is fantastic. And the others, even the ones i\u2019ve already killed off, are so fun to play with.\n\nDo you think Blaine\u2019s going to meet his match?\n\nHe kind of walks around like he doesn\u2019t believe there are consequences. I think that comes with his new zombie powers. And as long as he keeps avoiding head shots, he will continue walking around like the cock of the walk.\n\nWhat do you think would make him happiest? When will Blaine be happy?\n\nI don\u2019t know. I think the sky\u2019s the limit. I don\u2019t think he will ever be content. He wants to become King Zombie of Seattle. Maybe he\u2019ll run for mayor, haha. Maybe expanding his business outside Seattle.\n\nIs there a role that prepared you for this one?\n\nOh sure. You look at the canon of my work, and I\u2019ve played nothing but heavies. There\u2019s a lot of Sark in there from \u201cAlias,\u201d there\u2019s a lot of Adam Monroe from \u201cHeroes.\u201d A few episodes ago, [Liv] had a gun trained on [Blaine], and he ended up killing Lowell [Bradley James]? That episode we tried to round out Blaine\u2019s character a little bit, talking about how he loved Nirvana and growing up and stuff like that. It humanized him, if you will.\n\nWould you ever want to play a good guy?\n\nSure, I\u2019d like to play the protagonist, but it is more fun playing the bad guy. Though what else do I have to compare it to? That\u2019s all I know. I blame J.J. Abrams for my career trajectory. I blame and thank him, because he gave me my start, but he made me a bad guy for life. I was 20 years old when I got that part, and I\u2019m 34. i have a lot of time to play good guys. I have a lot of time yet. We\u2019re just getting started.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s the dynamic like on set?\n\nThe dynamic is really amazing. Me and the rest of the cast, we get along so well. We\u2019re thick as thieves. We\u2019re always hanging out and laughing on set and then off set we\u2019re always together. Every show I\u2019ve ever done, I\u2019ve had amazing TV families. And I thought \u201cAlias\u201d was going to ruin it for me because I thought I would never find another family as great as that. But every single job I\u2019ve ever had, I\u2019ve just had a blast and loved everybody at work, for the most part, haha. The dynamic is light and it\u2019s funny. We can laugh up until \u201caction,\u201d and then do our work between \u201caction\u201d and \u201ccut,\u201d and then continue laughing.\n\nYou\u2019ve been on lots of hit shows, shows that really took off and garnered obsessive fan followings. Is there a sense when you\u2019re in it that this is one of those shows that\u2019s really special, or that this is a show that people are going to be really loyal to?\n\nIn the past, I was lucky to hitch my wagon to already-successful shows in \u201cAlias\u201d and \u201cHeroes\u201d and \u201cVampire Diaries.\u201d This has been the first job that I\u2019ve gotten on the ground floor. It\u2019s the first pilot that I\u2019ve tested my way onto, amazingly. The feeling with this was it was something special, absolutely, we thought this was very different and refreshing. But we shot the whole season before a single episode aired, so we didn\u2019t know. We shot the whole thing, and after we wrapped, we were a month away from the pilot airing. We heard great things from down here in L.A., from the studio from Warner Bros. and from CW that they love it, they love all the dailies, they love all the cuts. And we believed them and just had to keep our heads down and keep doing what we were doing. Luckily, to this point, it\u2019s turned out well. I think that people are liking it, and hopefully we can build that audience and keep on going for 22 seasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFull-on zombie mode on Twitter: @NoeleneClark", "images":
