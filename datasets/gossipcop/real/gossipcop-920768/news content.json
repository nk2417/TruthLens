I mean, it was horrible. It was devastating for me, but to take something awesome from that and... look at me now! I'm here!\" she shared. \"I mean, this is like a dream come true to be here and taking something precious and very good from something devastating, it's awesome.\"\n\nAnd while Gutierrez didn't win the show, she told ET that she hoped she was able to build a larger fan base. \"I just hope that you like me. I tried my best,\" she said.\n\n\"I need to talk to my manager, my agent, my people, my family, and then I will tell you guys, but I hope that you keep following me and I hope that you keep liking me,\" she shared of what's next, adding that \"hopefully\" big things in Hollywood are in store.\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/gettyimages-502439334.jpg?h=95f7c783&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2016-03/1280_ariadna_gutierrez_getty502139172.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-01/et_TRENDING_MissUniverse_013017_hulu.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/gettyimages-502439334.jpg?h=95f7c783", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-11/steve_harvey_miss_universe_host_gettyimages-879856150_112617.jpg?h=b91b5a6f&width=256&quality=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/gettyimages-502439334.jpg?h=95f7c783", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/miss-universe-2015-runner-up-reunites-with-steve-harvey-2-years-after-famous-flub-98370", "title": "Miss Universe 2015 Runner-Up Reunites With Steve Harvey 2 Years After Famous Flub", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/gettyimages-502439334.jpg?h=95f7c783", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Thanks to one big mistake, Ariadna Gutierrez became the most famous runner-up in Miss Universe history.", "title": "Miss Universe 2015 Runner-Up Reunites With Steve Harvey 2 Years After Famous Flub", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/miss-universe-2015-runner-up-reunites-with-steve-harvey-2-years-after-famous-flub-98370", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Thanks to one big mistake, Ariadna Gutierrez became the most famous runner-up in Miss Universe history.", "twitter": {"description": "Thanks to one big mistake, Ariadna Gutierrez became the most famous runner-up in Miss Universe history.", "title": "Miss Universe 2015 Runner-Up Reunites With Steve Harvey 2 Years After Famous Flub", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/miss-universe-2015-runner-up-reunites-with-steve-harvey-2-years-after-famous-flub-98370", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-03/gettyimages-502439334.jpg?h=95f7c783", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Miss Universe 2015 Runner-Up Reunites With Steve Harvey 2 Years After Famous Flub | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, Steve Harvey", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
