Or it could all be a big joke. Lee and fiancee former Vine star Brittany Furlan posted a photo on Sunday (May 27) in which they are wearing matching white robes and slippers while kissing under an awning. The caption on the photo reads \u201cBEST. DAY. EVER. (to take a photo in front of someone\u2019s leftover wedding alter.\u201d\n\nExplore Tommy Lee See latest videos, charts and news\n\nThe cryptic nature of the caption made it unclear if the pair actually got married or were just having some fun, despite E! News reporting that the two \u2014 who announced their engagement on Valentine\u2019s Day 2018 \u2014 were wed in an \u201cintimate ceremony in front of a few lucky guests.\u201d Tommy Lee\u2019s caption on the same photo was even more cryptic: \u201cDid it, I do a LOT.\u201d\n\nFurther muddying in waters, Furlan tweeted a collage of headlines about the reported blessed event on Monday (28) with a series of laughing until you cry emoji with the caption \u201cBEST. PRACTICAL. JOKE. EVER.\u201d #WeWin.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Lee had no comment at press time. The 55 year-old rock star has been married three times before, to Elaine Bergen (1984-1985), Heather Locklear (1986-1993) and Pamela Anderson (1995-1998), with whom he has two sons, Brandon, 21 and Dylan, 20. He was briefly engaged to Sofia Toufa in 2014 before he started dating Furlan, 31, in 2017.\n\nAs if the \u201cdid they or didn\u2019t they?\u201d scenario wasn\u2019t confusing enough, on Friday the couple uploaded a black and white video in which it appears that Lee is offering Furlan a wedding ring, only to have he reject it, which leads to an expletive-filled voiceover in which Lee celebrates dating younger women, partying and never having to say you\u2019re sorry about anything.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/_Tommy-Lee-and-Brittany_Furlan-streamy-awards-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/_Tommy-Lee-and-Brittany_Furlan-streamy-awards-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=628&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/_Tommy-Lee-and-Brittany_Furlan-streamy-awards-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gil Kaufman", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/tommy-lee-marries-vine-star-brittany-furlan-or-does-he-8458051/", "title": "Tommy Lee Marries Vine Star Brittany Furlan, Or Does He?", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Pictures indicate that tied the knot for the fourth time over the weekend, but Furlani has been cagey about how official the ceremony was.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Gil Kaufman", "tags": "bbnews", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Tommy Lee Marries Vine Star Brittany Furlan, Or Does He?", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/tommy-lee-marries-vine-star-brittany-furlan-or-does-he-8458051/", "description": "Pictures indicate that tied the knot for the fourth time over the weekend, but Furlani has been cagey about how official the ceremony was.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/_Tommy-Lee-and-Brittany_Furlan-streamy-awards-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Tommy Lee and Brittany\u00a0Furlan"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-28T11:40:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-28T14:16:27+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pictures indicate that tied the knot for the fourth time over the weekend, but Furlani has been cagey about how official the ceremony was.", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Tommy Lee Marries Vine Star Brittany Furlan, Or Does He?", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/_Tommy-Lee-and-Brittany_Furlan-streamy-awards-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527507622.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
