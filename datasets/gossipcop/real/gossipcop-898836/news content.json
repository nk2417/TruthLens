Dave Meltzer of published the news first on F4WONline.com about an off-screen feud going on between the former two members of Team Rude.Apparently, it began due to a recent backstage fallout. The exact reason for the same was not unveiled. Nia unfollowed Alexa Bliss on social media platforms raised the speculations higher.
