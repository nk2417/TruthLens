The album is due Feb. 2 \u2014 two days before his halftime performance on the Super Bowl on Feb. 4.\n\n\u201cThis album is really inspired by my son, my wife, my family, but more so than any album I\u2019ve ever written, where I\u2019m from \u2014 it\u2019s personal,\u201d he says in the video, which is filled with shots of Timberlake in outdoors settings. In other shots he is seen working with Pharrell Williams, who says \u201cIt feels so earthy, it\u2019s just where you are in your life right now,\u201d before adding emphatically, \u201cThat is a smash,\u201d presumably about a song. Snippets of two or three new songs play in the background during the video.\n\nWhile the wintery scenes contrast with Timberlake\u2019s upbringing in Memphis, Tennessee, he has been saying for some months that the album, on which he also worked with longtime collaborators Max Martin and Shellback (with whom he collaborated on his last single, the hit \u201cCan\u2019t Stop the Feeling\u201d from the movie \u201cTrolls\u201d) and Timbaland, reflected his roots, calling it \u201cSouthern American music.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nTimberlake\u2019s halftime performance during the Super Bowl is set for Sunday, Feb. 4 at Minneapolis\u2019 U.S. Bank Stadium. Variety reported that he was the frontrunner on Sept. 27.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/justin-timberlake.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/justin-timberlake.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jem Aswad", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/justin-timberlake-announces-new-album-man-of-the-woods-single-coming-friday-watch-1202650769/", "title": "Justin Timberlake Announces New Album \u2018Man of the Woods\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Justin Timberlake announced a new album, \"Man of the Woods,\" due Feb. 4 - two days before his Super Bowl appearance - and a new single.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Jem Aswad", "tags": "Justin Timberlake", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Justin Timberlake Announces New Album \u2018Man of the Woods\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/justin-timberlake-announces-new-album-man-of-the-woods-single-coming-friday-watch-1202650769/", "description": "Justin Timberlake announced a new album, \"Man of the Woods,\" due Feb. 4 - two days before his Super Bowl appearance - and a new single.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/justin-timberlake.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Justin Timberlake Super Bowl"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-02T16:06:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-02T16:42:58+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Justin Timberlake announced a new album, \"Man of the Woods,\" due Feb. 4 - two days before his Super Bowl appearance - and a new single.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@jemaswad", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Justin Timberlake Announces New Album \u2018Man of the Woods\u2019", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/justin-timberlake.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514909207.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
