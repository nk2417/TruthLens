At least from what we get to see on social media and when the two are out in public, Chrissy and John look like they have a beautiful relationship and make a very happy family. I mean, when John tried to break up with her because he was too \u201cstressed,\u201d Chrissy had a very simple response: \u201cNo.\u201d What an inspiration. Their one-year-old daughter Luna definitely benefits from the couple\u2019s strong bond, but apparently she\u2019s also already learned a thing or two about making fun of her dad from her sarcastic mom.\n\nIn a new interview with E! News, Legend admitted that Luna is already making fun of him for his bad eyesight in the most adorable way, and, of course, with the support of her mom... and the entire planet population, probably.\n\n\"Chrissy has her doing this thing called 'Daddy Eyes,'\" Legend explained. \"[It started] because one day, I didn't have my contacts on, and I was squinting around the house. Luna started mocking my eyes. So Chrissy started calling it 'Daddy Eyes.'\"\n\nChrissy has actually captured Luna\u2019s adorable \u201cDaddy Eyes\u201d impression on her Snapchat before, and it's as adorable as you might have imagined.\n\n\"Luna has me cracking up all the time,\" Legend said, and, well, same. Just take a look as she watches her dad appear on Sesame Street for the very first time.\n\nLegend also spoke to E! News about how Luna is growing up. Luna and Chrissy have joined Legend on the European leg of his current tour, and according to him, it's been a great experience so far, especially for the little one.\n\n\"I love having them with me,\" he said. \"I've seen Luna grow up during the tour... She's really starting to walk now and really starting to talk a bit more now, too. A lot of that's happened while we were on the road. She's been on her first tour bus ride. She's been to her first concert. It's really a lot of fun having her experience a lot of firsts during this.\"\n\nAs long as Chrissy keeps teaching Luna jokes and how to follow in her sarcastic footsteps\u2014and documents it on her Snapchat\u2014then we can all look forward to even more jokes at Legend's expense... and we're 100 percent here for it.", "images": ["https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723868565/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-794-1670482091-19_16x9-6492278"], "top_img": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723868565/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-794-1670482091-19_16x9-6492278", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/julia-pimentel/chrissy-teigen-teaches-daughter-luna-to-make-fun-of-her-dad-john-legend", "title": "John Legend Is Already Getting Roasted by His Daughter\u2014Th...", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "John Legend admits Chrissy Teigen has already taught their daughter Luna how to make fun of him.", "og": {"title": "John Legend Is Already Getting Roasted by His Daughter\u2014Th...", "description": "John Legend admits Chrissy Teigen has already taught thei...", "url": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/julia-pimentel/chrissy-teigen-teaches-daughter-luna-to-make-fun-of-her-dad-john-legend", "site_name": "Complex", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723868565/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-794-1670482091-19_16x9-6492278", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "@complex", "id": 13049362}, "title": "John Legend Is Already Getting Roasted by His Daught...", "description": "John Legend admits Chrissy Teigen has already taught their daughter Luna how to make fun of him.", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723868565/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-794-1670482091-19_16x9-6492278"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.complex.com", "summary": ""}
