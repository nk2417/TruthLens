The show\u2019s recent May 13 Season 2 finale served as a series finale.\n\nPrimetime-Panic Your Complete Guide to Pilots and Straight-to-Series orders See All\n\n\u201cOver two seasons, E!\u2019s scripted series The Arrangement has taken viewers inside the world of an A-list movie star filled with secrets, scandal and romance,\u201d a E! spokesperson said in a statement to Deadline. \u201cWhile we have decided not to move forward with the series, we are incredibly grateful to the cast and our production partners.\u201d\n\nThe Arrangement was one of two original scripted series on E! along with The Royals, whose fourth season aired alongside The Arrangement. The fate of that series, whose creator-showrunner Mark Schwahn was fired in December amid sexual harassment allegations, has not been decided.\n\nOn the scripted side, E! recently ordered the high-profile pilot Juicy Stories from Michael Patrick King.\n\nThe Arrangement was a breakout when it debuted in March 2017, averaging 1.3 million total viewers and 725,000 in the 18-49 demo in Live+3, and ranking as the year\u2019s second-biggest scripted cable drama launch with young women (women 18-34). Its ratings slipped by double digits in Season 2, as did the ratings for its companion The Royals.\n\nFrom Universal Cable Productions and writer/executive producer Jonathan Abrahams, The Arrangement starred Josh Henderson, Christine Evangelista, Lexa Doig and Michael Vartan in a Hollywood love story shedding light on the darker side of fame.", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/the-arrangement.jpg?w=620", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/the-arrangement.jpg?w=620&h=383&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/the-arrangement.jpg?w=620", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nellie Andreeva", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/05/the-arrangement-canceled-e-2-seasons-1202399605/", "title": "\u2018The Arrangement\u2019 Canceled By E!
