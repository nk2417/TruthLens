News and CNBC have reached out to the studio for comment but have not independently confirmed the reports.\n\nPirates of the Caribbean World Premieres: 2003 vs. 2017\n\nThe fifth installment of the highly-anticipated franchise stars Javier Bardem as the villain opposite Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow. Other \"Pirates\" favorites set to return include Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, Keira Knightly as Elizabeth Swann and Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa.\n\nShanghai Disney Resort hosted the movie's world premiere, followed by another star-studded event in Paris and the U.S. premiere in Los Angeles on May 18.\n\nDirector Joachim Ronning squashed rumors that \"Dead Men Tell No Tales\" would be the franchise's last, teasing to CinemaBlend, \"This is the beginning of the finale... But I don't know if it's the last one, or if they'll make another 10 of them. I don't know! But I hope so!\"\n\n\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\" premieres nationwide May 26.", "images": ["https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/11/Santa-Clarita-fire.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/09/GettyImages-2210941206.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C6000px%2C3375px&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/LA_aerial-1-1.png?fit=2060%2C847&quality=85&strip=all&w=400&h=44&crop=1", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/11/GettyImages-2214979173.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C510px%2C3370px%2C1896px&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/08/Roku_Channel_Tile_2000x3000_LosAngeles.png?fit=3000%2C2000&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/10/KNBC_Rings_On_Light@3x.png?fit=399%2C120&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/11/Woman-killed-Alhambra-officer-hurt-in-pursuit-crash.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/11/251120-mia-thornton-getty.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/11/TRUMP-SEDITION.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/11/anaheim-car-thefts.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/10/KNBC_Rings_On_Dark@3x.png?fit=402%2C120&quality=85&strip=all&w=134&h=40", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/04/LA-web@3x.png?fit=838%2C72&quality=85&strip=all", "https://nbcu.tmsimg.com/assets/p25320145_b_h10_aa.jpg?w=960&h=540"], "top_img": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/08/Roku_Channel_Tile_2000x3000_LosAngeles.png?fit=3000%2C2000&quality=85&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mckenna Aiello"], "canonical_link": "http://www.eonline.com/news/852482/hackers-threaten-to-leak-upcoming-pirates-of-the-caribbean-film-unless-disney-pays-ransom", "title": "Hackers Threaten to Leak Upcoming \u2018Pirates of the Caribbean' Unless Disney Pays Ransom: Reports", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.6.4", "parsely-title": "Hackers Threaten to Leak Upcoming \u2018Pirates of the Caribbean' Unless Disney Pays Ransom: Reports", "parsely-link": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/hackers-steal-pirates-of-the-caribben-movie-ransom/2025667/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-05-16T01:15:09Z", "parsely-section": "Entertainment", "parsely-tags": "los angeles", "parsely-author": "McKenna Aiello", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Los Angeles", "type": "article", "description": "Online pirates who claim to have Disney\u2019s unreleased action flick \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\u201d in their possession are threatening to leak it unless Disney pays up, according to multiple reports.
