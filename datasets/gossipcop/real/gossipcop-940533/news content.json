Yes, another Royal Wedding is happening\u2014soon! On Friday, October 12th, Princess Eugenie, 28, and her fianc\u00e9, Jack Brooksbank, 31, will become the next new royal newlyweds.\n\nOn the polished heels of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding, another regal celebration is a welcomed jubilee. Here\u2019s what we know about Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank\u2019s planned nuptials.\n\nPrincess Eugenie, the youngest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York is ninth in line for the coveted throne\u2014just behind her elder sister, Princess Beatrice. As reported by BBC News, Eugenie is a real working royal as a director at a gallery in Hauser and Wirth in London. Jack is a brand manager for Casamigos Tequila (co-founded by George Clooney who might be making his second royal wedding appearance of the year).\n\nRoyal watchers will recall that the couple officially announced their engagement via the Royal Family\u2019s Twitter account this past January. As we previously reported, the couple met back in 2011 skiing in the Swiss Alps. From one epic location to meet (and fall in love) the location of their engagement was just as epic\u2014near a lakeside Nicaraguan volcano \u2014ah, young royal love.\n\nAfter Jack bestowed Princess Eugenie with a stunning pink diamond sapphire engagement ring (so extra) it was announced that their marriage will take place at St. George\u2019s Chapel in Windsor (the same place Harry and Meghan tied the knot).\n\nAs reported by Harper\u2019s Bazaar, royal romantics at heart will be able to watch the next set of royals walk down the aisle as TLC will be the only network to broadcast the wedding in the United States. The viewing starts early\u20144:25 a.m. EST Friday, October 12th. So have your teapot hot and your scones pre-jammed for another English wedding spectacle.\n\nWhile the past regal weddings have been very pomp-and-circumstance, this one is expected to be the same with an environmental-friendly no-plastic stance.\n\nThis past August, British Vogue shared the news that both Princess Eugenie and Jack are planning to have an eco-conscious planned wedding as she and her sister, Beatrice grew up in an \u201canti-plastic\u201d home. She told British Vogue, \u201cMy whole house is anti-plastic now \u2013 and Jack and I want our wedding to be like that as well.\u201d", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a660b97416e79028178ab5e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/eugenie-fb.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/671a3afebbc1dde5acafe3e3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/69038036342692c40f57856c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/69024286e1c29f6cd8db22bf/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68adfa536792e9692a12b0a1/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68f8df38ca7f0ee7c7506f40/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/690391b0c6a94a1d16841cf9/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a660b6e11a3834527c5f4f9/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-908740486.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6904c171934452742846a6d4/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/69020cc33b241987da617a67/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/67dd51619d07f017918d6063/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6894890bb0414fdff135dbc0/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/690892896c20c256ee25ca0c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6908c0d9d71d354f6eefbe64/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a660b97416e79028178ab5e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/eugenie-fb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katelyn Chef"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/princess-eugenie-royal-wedding-everything-we-know", "title": "Princess Eugenie\u2019s Royal Wedding: Everything We Know So Far", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Katelyn Chef", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Everything we know about Princess Eugenie\u2019s royal wedding to Jack Brooksbank, taking place October 12, 2018.", "id": "5bb7a6e4ed6266479c1a931c", "keywords": "princess eugenie,royal wedding", "news_keywords": "princess eugenie,royal wedding", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5bb7a6e4ed6266479c1a931c", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Everything we know about Princess Eugenie\u2019s royal wedding to Jack Brooksbank, taking place October 12, 2018.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a660b6e11a3834527c5f4f9/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-908740486.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a660b6e11a3834527c5f4f9/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-908740486.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Here\u2019s everything you need to know, including how to watch.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a660b97416e79028178ab5e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/eugenie-fb.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Princess Eugenie\u2019s Royal Wedding Is Only a Week Away", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/princess-eugenie-royal-wedding-everything-we-know"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-10-05T18:19:21.986Z", "modified_time": "2018-10-05T18:19:21.986Z", "author": "Katelyn Chef"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "Here\u2019s everything you need to know, including how to watch.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a660b97416e79028178ab5e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/eugenie-fb.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Princess Eugenie\u2019s Royal Wedding Is Only a Week Away"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a660b97416e79028178ab5e/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/eugenie-fb.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1538763561.986, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
