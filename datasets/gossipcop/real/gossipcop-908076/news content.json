So we have to honor them by picking the right actor to play them\u2014while making a link between the actors who played these characters in the first seasons.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Menzies hinted that he was not sure whether he would be returning to Game of Thrones, telling Digital Spy that his character is \u201cobviously somewhere in a prison, he\u2019s still around alive somewhere . . . I feel like they have so many stories to tie up, whether that\u2019s a story they\u2019ll want to go back to, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Menzies\u2019s Outlander co-star Caitriona Balfe celebrated the casting by tweeting the initial report along with the message, \u201cCongratulations darling. So excited for you and so excited to see this!!!\u201d\n\nLast fall, The Crown cast Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II. Claire Foy, who played Queen Elizabeth during the drama\u2019s first two seasons, has joked that audiences will quickly forget about the original cast.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll forget all about me and the rest of the cast,\u201d she quipped in December. \u201cYou\u2019ll be like, \u2018Who are they?\u2019 We\u2019re the warm-up act.\u201d\n\nDeadline reported that Menzies \u201csigned on for the next two seasons, and begins shooting this summer in the U.K.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69138dc2108d96082627c8f5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined",
