We watched Cameran contemplate whether or not she should start a family with husband Jason Wimberly for a few seasons on Southern Charm.\n\nHow to Watch Southern Charm Season 11 airs on Wednesdays at 9/8c on Bravo. Stream episodes next day on Peacock. Stream on\n\nBut then everything seemed to change last April when Cameran announced that she and Jason were expecting their first child, a girl. Fast-forward to November 11, 2017, and the Southern Charm couple welcomed little Palmer Corrine Wimberly into the world.\n\nNow that Cameran is five months into motherhood and has experienced all of the ups and downs it has to offer, we're all dying to know if the Southern Charm mom is now eager to keep on expanding her family. \"No, I will not have more kids in the future,\" Cameran said definitively when The Daily Dish caught up with her in New York on Tuesday. \"My husband and I had a very serious baby talk on our anniversary, and we weighed the pros and we weighed the cons. And I do not think I will be having more children.\"\n\nCheck out the post on Instagram\n\nThough the psychic healer at one of Patricia Altschul's parties last season of Southern Charm predicted that Cameran would have three children, it sounds like Palmer is all she and her husband need. \"I don't think I have the personality for more than one. I think I would have to jump off a bridge,\" Cameran joked. \"No, one is good. With one child, one parent can take [her], the other person can get things done. It's my speed.\"\n\nCameran didn't exactly love the nine months-plus leading up to Palmer's birth, either. \"I didn't really like being pregnant, so I don't really want to go through it again. I'm good,\" she said. \"I wasn't one of the women that loved being pregnant. I was kind of mortified by the whole thing.\"\n\nRelated\n\nBut of course, Cameran couldn't be happier to have Palmer in her life. \"Yes, I am glad that I went through with it. I love Palmer. It is so true, like the saying, 'When you have a baby, your heart lives outside of your body.' It is the most love you will ever feel,\" she shared. \"It's so intense that it's almost scary, so it's crazy.\"\n\nAnd with a daughter like this, we have a feeling we know exactly what Cam means.\n\nCheck out the post on Instagram\n\nRelive Cameran's journey to motherhood, below.", "images":
