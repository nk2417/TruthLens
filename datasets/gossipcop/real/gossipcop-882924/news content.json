The show has toyed with expectations of revelation ever since then \u2014 we are all inquisitive Toby, dying to be in the know! \u2014 most notably by withholding the answer in the season 1 finale, much to fans\u2019 frustration, and also by occasionally doling out tantalizing clue morsels such as the approximate time of death (the Big Three were only teenagers when he died), the family member that feels the most guilt about it (Kate), a likely cause of demise (fire), and how tragedy may have been avoided (if only the smoke detector had a new battery!).\n\nLast summer, This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman promised that audiences would finally receive the critical information they\u2019ve been craving during the second season \u2014 and they wouldn\u2019t have to wait all the way until the series finale to get it. Clues were conspicuously placed in the past-flashforward in the season 2 premiere: Kevin\u2019s cast, Kevin\u2019s whereabouts, Randall with his red-headed girlfriend, Kate with an unfamiliar dog, Rebecca in a Steelers jersey. Given that tonight\u2019s closing image was of that a very eager fire, and that those clues have been accounted for in our story, and that only four episodes are left to air before the finale \u2014 one of them situated in the plum post-Super Bowl slot \u2014 it appears that the grim reaper will come knocking as early as next episode, something confirmed in the promo for the Super Bowl installment that ran after the episode.\n\nRon Batzdorff/NBC\n\nFans had long been theorizing about the precise manner of Jack\u2019s death, ranging from a plane crash to a heart attack to a drunk driving accident (he is a recovering alcoholic) to Miguel (Jon Huertas) murdering Jack. Then came a key clue, which dropped at the end of the season 2 premiere, as Rebecca (Mandy Moore) was seen wailing in front of the burned down Pearson home. (That led to more theories, including this creative one, that the longstanding washing machine \u2014 a.k.a., the best washing machine in the whole world \u2014 was the spark for tragedy.) Did Jack indeed go out in a blaze of glory? With each cliffhanger clue, it seems more likely. And the final seconds of Tuesday\u2019s episode \u2014 a montage of wonderful family memories juxtaposed with flames winding through the house, caused by that faulty slow cooker \u2014 will only add fuel to the fire that a fire fueled his death.\n\nVentimiglia has found it \u201camazing that people are so engaged\u201d by the morbid mystery. Surprisingly enough, though, fans have restrained themselves in running their theories by him over the last year, and that\u2019s something he has appreciated. \u201cIt\u2019s very respectful as well as kind because I don\u2019t want to sit there and deflect too much,\u201d he told EW earlier this season, \u201cbecause I\u2019m sure at some point someone\u2019s going to say something that\u2019s going to ring true, and then my talent as an actor is really going to come to the forefront. It\u2019s the hardest position to be in, because I want people to know, but I also want them to wait for it.\u201d (As for debunking any theories, all he\u2019ll say is: \u201cIt\u2019s not Colonel Mustard with a wrench in the library. It feels like a game of Clue, right?\u201d)\n\nFor the record, Ventimiglia is sympathetic to those fans who felt let down when left hanging at the end of season 1. \u201cI absolutely understand how the audience wanted to see Jack\u2019s death because it was teed up for that,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think they were led to believe that it was happening; they just had a desire because it felt like the biggest moment for this family was their father passing.\u201d He can relate to viewers\u2019 desire to simply fast-forward to The Answer: \u201cI think people want to get to it so they can have acceptance, they can have closure, they can have an understanding moving forward.\u201d But he believes they should leave their theories and expectations at the door. \u201cHaving the understanding that these kids and this woman are going to lose a massive part of their family should be enough that whatever happens \u2014 or how it happens \u2014 should be satisfying enough. Or heartbreaking enough,\u201d he says. \u201cHow do you applaud a man\u2019s death, especially a good man? People should just understand that it\u2019s coming and wait and process it when it does. Not everybody has the luxury to know that death is coming \u2014 but we all know that Jack\u2019s death is coming.\u201d\n\nAnd when death actually becomes him, how traumatic and teary will it be?\u201dIt\u2019s just an absolute soul-crushing event,\u201d he answers. \u201cOnce you figure out the moment where it\u2019s going to happen, you may get some hope \u2014 and then it\u2019s all going to go away.\u201d He has another way of putting it: \u201cI think the best thing I can say \u2014 or the worst thing I can say \u2014 is: It\u2019s going to be f\u2014ing painful.\u201d\n\nOf course, This Is Us is no stranger to piercing, poignant passings \u2014 last season\u2019s third-to-last episode featured the bittersweet loss of the terminally ill William (Ron Cephas Jones), an event Ventimiglia says \u201ccrushed\u201d him. And as intense and heartbreaking as \u201cMemphis\u201d proved to be, the episode that takes down Jack will cut and resonate even deeper. \u201cWhen they learn what happened to Jack, I think people are going to find themselves surprised with their own emotion,\u201d he continues. \u201cI really think people are going to have a hard time accepting it, but what they should know is that even when we do find out Jack\u2019s death, it doesn\u2019t mean that Jack goes away. That\u2019s a good thing to remind people of \u2014 I\u2019m not going away from the show, Jack is still around. There is still so much story to mine in this world of This Is Us.\u201d He adds with a laugh: \u201cI think at that point then you gotta start wondering if anyone else is going to die. I\u2019m going, \u2018Whoo! All right! I\u2019m off the hook!'\u201d\n\nThere is also the matter of Kate\u2019s guilt \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m the reason he\u2019s dead,\u201d she tearfully told Toby last season \u2014 and more light will be shed on that darkness. How justifiable is her guilt? \u201cI would say it\u2019s all pretty accurate and really devastating to her,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s something she still hangs onto. It took her a long time to be able to talk about her father, and she\u2019s still not giving Toby everything she feels about Jack\u2019s passing. She\u2019s had to battle her demons, and a lot of that stuff is going to come to the front of her story line.\u201d\n\nVentimiglia hopes that fans don\u2019t become so consumed with the mystery and mystique of Jack\u2019s death that they lose sight of the proud papa himself. \u201cI still say to people, \u2018Focus on the man\u2019s life and don\u2019t show me at least how much you\u2019re salivating for his death,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m like \u2018Man, wait \u2019til people find out this next bit of information that they\u2019re going to start to understand about Jack or the family.\u2019 God, there\u2019s so much still to learn about these people, so I hope people can get the satisfaction of the death and move on \u2014 and understand it goes even deeper.\u201d\n\nTo
