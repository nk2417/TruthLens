She did, of course: Cohen, as \u201creclusive Italian billionaire\u201d Gio Monaldo, had Corinne pose in a hazmat suit in front of a greenscreen so that she could be Photoshopped into real charity work fighting Ebola, and then prodded her to invent a story about how she saved 6,000 innocents from being massacred in Sierra Leone. Olympios looked a little confused at points, but overall, fell for Cohen\u2019s ruses. When he asked her to assert that she was in Sierra Leone for a month, she dropped her \u201cinterviewee\u201d voice to point out that \u201cthey\u201d would know she was never really there. Cohen, as the expansive, ponytailed art director, waved this away, explaining it was his charity.\n\nOnce she realized she\u2019d been duped, Olympios spoke with Vanity Fair about the encounter. She seemed fairly good-natured about the setup\u2014and in her line of work, any publicity works to her benefit. But reading between the lines, Who Is America?\u2019s devices appear more like entrapment than sportsmanlike hoodwinking. Olympios was separated from her manager and her phone, and when she tried to ask questions about what was happening to her, Cohen and his team repeatedly assured her that everything was \u201cfine\u201d\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s a big deal. You\u2019re going to be on the cover of this magazine. It\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nShe described being so nervous that she was shaking, and said the crew evaded her questions about her manager, pretending that he was on the phone elsewhere when they\u2019d actually sent him home. At one point, she said, she thought to herself, while panicked and hyperventilating, \u201cOh my God, am I going to die? Is this O.K.? Am I O.K.?\u201d When she left, she said, she cried for hours. Discovering she had merely been subjected to a prank from Cohen was a relief, she said, because \u201cimagine if that was real.\u201d\n\nOlympios became famous after her heel turn on The Bachelor, known for vapid quips that made the audience, and the other contestants, love to hate her. As Vulture\u2019s Kathryn VanArendonk wrote, she never quite fit into the villain edit, but she was certainly memorable\u2014a woman who bragged about her \u201cplatinum vagine\u201d and was especially fond of cheesy pasta. In classic reality-star form, Olympios seemed to thrive on the controversy she created\u2014a necessary character trait in the vicious world of reality television, albeit one that tends to incense viewers.\n\nBut after that show ended, Olympios moved to another series in the Bachelor-verse, and became known for something quite different: a drunken hookup she had with DeMario Jackson that unnerved a Bachelor in Paradise producer so much that the producer filed a complaint, reportedly over the conviction that Olympios was not in a position to consent to the sex act. Production on the show was subsequently halted. After the incident made headlines, Olympios made an unambiguous statement to People: \u201cI am a victim . . . As a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69138dc2108d96082627c8f5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined",
