Even when there wasn\u2019t a performer on the stage, though, Las Vegas was brimming with star-studded moments \u2014 and Billboard was in the middle of all the action.\n\nWhether it was on the magenta carpet prior to the show, in the seats, or on the Winner\u2019s Walk backstage, Billboard had T-Mobile Arena covered with eyes peeled for some of the night\u2019s biggest moments that cameras didn\u2019t capture. Take a look at the 26 moments you missed below (all times local):\n\n3:15 p.m. PT: Camila Cabello makes her grand exit from the magenta carpet in a flowing red dress, turning around to ask a member of her posse, \u201cDid I kill it?\u201d\n\n4 p.m.: The Chainsmokers sneak past the magenta carpet madness and walk through the general admission line to get into T-Mobile Arena \u2014 but not without some eager fans noticing, shouting Drew Taggart\u2019s name, to which he smiled and waved.\n\n4:13 p.m.: As DJ Khaled and Halsey record a Snapchat together, he tells her he wants to work together. (Fingers crossed for that request to come to life\u2026)\n\n4:19 p.m.: Khaled and Diplo snap a selfie, then Halsey gets in, stalling her interview with Billboard.

Once the telecast goes to commercial break, the announcer instructs the crowd to pop all remaining balloons to clear them out.\n\n6:15 p.m.: Following a bouncy performance of \u201cGreen Light,\u201d Lorde makes a rather quiet exit from the stage with her head down and a slight smirk as she passes photographers.\n\n6:31 p.m.: Ashley Tisdale gives Lea Michele a \u201cyou got this!\u201d hug before she goes onstage to introduce Celine Dion\u2019s performance of \u201cMy Heart Will Go On.\u201d\n\n6:36 p.m.: Diddy poses for a backstage photo with Biggie\u2019s son Christopher Jordan Wallace after Diddy\u2019s touching Biggie tribute.
