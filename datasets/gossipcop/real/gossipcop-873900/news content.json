We are overwhelmed and can\u2019t believe a photo would go viral like this. I hate it every minute of this exposure,' she said to DailyMail.com.\n\nParents Ted Bollinger and Sil Mazzini say they regret sharing the viral photo of their six-year-old son Teddy sitting alone when no one showed up to his pizza birthday party on Sunday\n\nSil Mazzini says she wishes she didn't share the picture of Teddy at his birthday pizza party in Tucson, Arizona saying: 'I was upset. That\u2019s why I wrote a message. But I never expected any of this, for this to go so viral'\n\nWhen it comes to next year's birthday, Mazzini says Teddy will have no party at all.\n\n'No we are not. Not anymore, I don't think so because it's so much planning for me. I will just take him on a trip,' she said to the New York Post.\n\nThis year he had the option to go to Disney World, Legoland, or have a party with his class. He unfortunately chose the latter.\n\nMazzini said her family was heartbroken that no one showed up to Teddy's party. She believes that families may have been worn out from the school's Halloween carnival on Saturday where students showed up with their parents.\n\nOn top of that on Sunday - her son's birthday - it was raining.\n\nBut still only one parent called her following the incident to apologize for being a no-show.\n\n'I was bummed, I was bummed out for sure,' father Ted Bollinger said.\n\n'Teddy, the biggest things for him was having his classmates there, so not seeing them show up an hour into the party was disappointing,' he added.\n\nThankfully Teddy wasn't disheartened for long and enjoyed playing the arcade games and eating the pizza.\n\n'He's six, so he was distracted by the arcade games, the pizza, he got over it quick. He\u2019s tough. But when Sil told me she was posting [the photo], I told her not to do it, but she did and it took off. It\u2019s pretty wild,' Bollinger said.\n\nTeddy was also just grateful to spend his special day with his father, who works in an Alaska oil field and is often absent for weeks at a time.\n\n'So at the end of the day, he was very happy,' Mazzini said.\n\nParents said Teddy got over his sadness at the party and enjoyed the pizza, arcade games, and spending time with his dad Ted who works in oil fields in Alaska and is often away from home\n\nThe family has been criticized for begging for sympathy on social media. Sil said: 'We didn\u2019t do this for attention or for gifts or anything. I did it in the moment but I wasn\u2019t smart. I was upset. That\u2019s it'. Teddy pictured in a Halloween costume left and with mom Sil right\n\nMazzini said she received 'like 15 RSVPS' and was incredulous when not a single classmate of Teddy's at BASIS Tuscon Primary School showed up.\n\n'I sent invitations two weeks in advance with my phone number and had 32 goodie bags full of toys for each kid in the class,' Mazzini said to DailyMail.com.\n\nUpset with her hard work and having to pay the bill of $130 even after no one showed up, her friend urged her to post the picture online so Teddy could at least get some birthday wishes.\n\nBut now she regrets sharing the photo and she's says she's disheartened by the negative comments accusing her of begging for sympathy online.\n\n'I was kind of shocked and then at the end when I had to pay for it, I was upset. That\u2019s why I wrote a message. But I never expected any of this, for this to go so viral,' she said.\n\nDespite their remorse, the viral fame has opened some incredible doors for Teddy and his family.\n\nThe viral photo caught the attention of the Phoenix Suns NBA team and the Phoenix Rising MLS team who both invited Teddy to celebrate his big day at their upcoming games.\n\nThe Rising soccer team offered Teddy tickets to a playoff game on Friday along with a personalized jersey.\n\nThe team wrote on Twitter: 'Teddy can get The Mala from @VeneziasPizza and join 7,000 of his closest friends this Friday. Come on out Teddy! #UpRising.'\n\nWednesday night Teddy and his family be the special guests at the Phoenix Suns game versus the Los Angeles Lakers where they'll get to see Lebron James in action.\n\nThe viral fame opened some incredible doors for Teddy's family, including tickets to Wednesday night's Phoenix Suns versus the Los Angeles Lakers NBA game\n\nThe Phoenix Suns NBA team and Phoenix Rising MLS team both invited Teddy to celebrate his birthday at their upcoming games after the sad pizza party photo went viral\n\nDJ Khaled also shared Teddy's sad photo on Instagram calling him 'Young King' and saying that he wanted to send the Arizona kindergartner a birthday present\n\nThe Suns tweeted: 'How about we celebrate with thousands at our place! Tickets to Wednesday\u2019s #SunsVSLakers game are all yours Teddy! Talk soon!'\n\nDJ Khaled also shared the viral image on Instagram writing: 'Bless up and happy birthday to the Young King Teddy! The Khaled Family, @asahdkhaled and the We The Best foundation want to send you a birthday present!'\n\nAt school the following day of the birthday party Teddy said all the kids gave him their apologies, saying they forgot to go.\n\n'It was a tough day for him, but it happened and we're moving on,' Mazzini said.\n\nNow the family is just looking forward to the NBA game Wednesday night.\n\n'It's going to be insane,' Bollinger said.\n\n'I just honestly thought this would be local news in Tucson and maybe Phoenix, but we're getting calls from around the world. It's nothing like I would've ever guessed, never in my wildest dreams,' he added.\n\nNew friends: The viral post led to a massive outpour of warm happy birthday wishes for Teddy\n\nHundreds of social media users sent happy birthday wishes to the sad kindergartender\n\nCritic: But not everyone was so kind. Some users accused the mom of begging for sympathy from the internet by posting the photo\n\nMany of the people commenting on the post about Teddy's party expressed outrage that his mother would share her son's humiliation with the news outlet\n\nTeddy has also made hundreds of friends online, receiving a major outpour of support and birthday wishes following his viral photo.\n\nFacebook user Tyler Hendrick commented: 'From one friend to another: People are wonderful, but the quantity matters little. It is the quality of those you choose that matter. <3 Be happy and enjoy ALL that pizza!! That is the best part!'\n\nWilliam O'Brien wrote: 'Happy birthday my man. Once you realize happiness is from the inside stuff like this won\u2019t hurt so bad. Wish I\u2019d known I\u2019d have made the drive to see you. Happy birthday lil fella.'\n\nHowever the family was also shamed, with many social media users accusing the mom of begging for attention.\n\nKathy Van Hilsen wrote on Facebook: 'Sounds like a poor attempt get sympathy and or gift using social media. I highly doubt if the mother planned the party correctly nobody would show up. Plus what Mother (sic) invites the entire class. She set him up for failure and then publicized her accomplishment to shame him more. Sad.'\n\nNancy Niblett had similar concerns, commenting: 'Something is wrong here. First of all why didn\u2019t they ask for RSVP?... Parents either wanted attention and gifts or something by sending this to the news.'", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/19/12/104005979-0-image-m-6_1763553771266.jpg",
