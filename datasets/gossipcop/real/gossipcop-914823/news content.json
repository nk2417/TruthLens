Just to remind everybody. And how many of you would vote for him again?\"\n\nShe also asked: \"Who here believes that he made the comment about, quote, 's---hole countries?'\"\n\nIt appeared the president was watching Ms Winfrey interviewing his supporters, before tweeting.", "images": ["https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2025/11/20/TELEMMGLPICT000250535149_17636755153500_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqRdPLSElEmrKaK7hcQaxOdMeNcjRjuLHmhOq55j3Kz-o.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/ui/dist/static/resources/images/flags/USA-SVG.svg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/en-us/news/2025/11/20/TELEMMGLPICT000182002317_17636769156290_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkB6NGcx1p0Y6SxevG-oALf4Xpit_DMGvdp2n7FDd82k.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2025/11/20/TELEMMGLPICT000449700181_17636653560960_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/02/19/oprah_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?imwidth=640", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/02/19/oprah_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?impolicy=OG-Standard", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/ui/dist/static/resources/images/flags/UK-SVG.svg", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/world-news/2025/11/20/TELEMMGLPICT000449474931_17636790792470_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQf0Rf_Wk3V23H2268P_XkPxc.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2025/11/20/TELEMMGLPICT000449732395_17636820515870_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqCcQaEeTIIGKiH0Dcb5J7KJ5khTDrX68gx1ruRvFb7o4.jpeg?imwidth=350", "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2025/11/21/TELEMMGLPICT000436723950_17636878594980_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq15XUfPwoY7svuJOpueeorfglp-O-0tXy4cPh95DZ_mE.jpeg?imwidth=350"], "top_img": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/02/19/oprah_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?impolicy=OG-Standard", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Helena Horton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/19/donald-trump-ignites-feud-oprah-winfrey-asking-run-president/", "title": "Donald Trump dares Oprah Winfrey to run for President so he can 'expose and defeat' her", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=388947468", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2c769d", "msapplication-TileImage": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-tooltip": "The Telegraph", "msapplication-config": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/mstile-310x150.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/etc.clientlibs/settings/wcm/designs/telegraph/core/clientlibs/core/resources/icons/mstile-70x70.png", "theme-color": "#072A3A", "description": "Donald Trump has fired off an angry tweet about Oprah Winfrey, objecting to her interviewing style, and daring her to run for President so he can &quot;expose and defeat&quot;
