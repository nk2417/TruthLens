Fans noticed an immediate chemistry between the pair when they reunited at the Golden Globes the following year. Since then, they officially went on a date\u2014in a chicken shop, of course\u2014thanks to Amelia\u2019s viral web show.\n\nSparks continued flying when they sat across from each other and explored their connection on camera. \u201cCome on, we can own that it\u2019s been vibey,\u201d Andrew said during the episode, to which Amelia replied, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s been vibey to the point where you\u2019ve been avoiding me for two years because the vibes were too much for you to handle, so I\u2019m actually surprised you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nNeedless to say: The banter was bantering, and Amelia has since opened up about the experience during her press tour celebrating the 10-year anniversary of Chicken Shop Date. Along with our Expensive Taste Test, Amelia made a pit stop at BuzzFeed for an interview, where she played with pups and revealed her thoughts on her highly anticipated date with Andrew.\n\n\u201cI think it was pretty, pretty good actually. I think it was pretty good\u2026it was a very original date,\u201d she told the outlet during her Puppy Interview. \u201cI was going to say I\u2019ve never felt that way before, but...it was just very different. It was a very different date. I\u2019m trying to be very coy about it. I\u2019m playing it cool.\u201d\n\nTaylor Miller/BuzzFeed Celeb\n\nAfter she and Andrew made their Chicken Shop Date debut, Amelia shared an earnest moment with Sesame Street\u2019s Elmo during their following playdate. \u201cI met someone recently,\u201d she told the beloved muppet, who asked, \u201cAnd what did you think of them?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I really like them and I feel like it went well, but I feel like I was in my head again and maybe I sort of friend-zoned them before we could even begin,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt was a great date though\u2014we\u2019ve got real chemistry...I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see how it goes.\u201d\n\nIn February 2025, Amelia gave a much needed update on the situation during an interview with . \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Amelia told the publication of their connection. \u201cOtherwise, I would be going out with him already, wouldn\u2019t I?\u201d\n\nHer quote comes a few days after Andrew was spotted with A Complete Unknown\u2019s Monica Barbaro. Andrew has historically kept his romantic life pretty low-key, so he hasn\u2019t confirmed his relationship status with Monica amid dating rumors.", "images":
