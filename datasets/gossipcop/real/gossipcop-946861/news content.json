I feel like this is exactly what you\u2019ve been looking for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love this,\u201d Nikki gushes while admiring herself in the mirror. \u201cI feel like a Barbie! I think this is it. Yes!\u201d\n\nWhile talking to the camera as part of the show, TooFab reports, Brie suggests her sister has decided on the dress before she even admitted it to her friends.\n\n\u201cYou always know when a bride finds her dress, because when they walk out and it\u2019s like this big smile and they feel like a queen,\u201d Brie said. \u201cYou\u2019re just like, \u2018That\u2019s it, that\u2019s the smile I\u2019ve been looking for lately.\u2019 And I just feel like now we\u2019ve just made a turn, things are going to start feeling really special, like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m getting married.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe video, and bittersweet moment, comes days after Nikki set the record straight on the state of her relationship with Cena in a new YouTube video.\n\n\u201cRight now, we\u2019re just friends,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are both working on each other and trying to work on us. We talk every day. He is not only my best friend, he is truly one of the most amazing people I\u2019ve ever met, and he has patience with me, and he has really taught me a lot over the past few months. I think one of those things is an inner strength that I thought I had but didn\u2019t realize how strong I had it.\u201d\n\nShe did add, however, \u201cI do have hope for us.\u201d\n\nThe couple officially called off their engagement back in April, weeks away from their wedding day, after Cena was seemingly unwilling to have kids. However, after the WWE superstar agreed to reverse his vasectomy and have children with Nikki, she still faced some concerns about the big day.\n\n\u201cThis is forever, and I don\u2019t want to be someone who has a divorce or who has kids and then gets a divorce,\u201d Bella explained. \u201cI want to walk down that aisle and give my vows and have this be one time.\u201d\n\nThe reality star also admitted that reliving her toughest breakup on screen every week has been tough, also confusing fans on the status of their relationship.\n\n\u201cI have to say, it\u2019s extremely hard to relive every week, because I think all of us have been through breakups, but to go through a breakup that\u2019s so public, and then have to relive it on a reality show makes it super tough,\u201d she admitted.\n\nHopefully there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll find their footing sooner rather than later.\n\n\u201cHopefully one day we\u2019ll get back together, and if we don\u2019t, we both want each other to be very, very happy,\u201d she concluded.\n\nTotal Bellas airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET on E!.", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/billy-ray-cyrus-elizabeth-hurley-2.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/fire-country-season-4-key-art-cbs.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/08/32a08016-72b7-41f8-b593-df0f660db84e.png?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jose Bastidas", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/news/nikki-bella-finds-dream-dress-wedding-john-cena/", "title": "Nikki Bella Finds Dream Dress for Wedding to John Cena", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nikki Bella Finds Dream Dress for Wedding to John Cena", "description": "Nikki Bella may insist she\u2019s \u201cjust friends\u201d with ex-fiance John Cena, but the Total Bellas star has found her second perfect wedding dress.
