The bff to Kim states that he knows that having more kids has always been what Kardashian wants and that her children have become her no.1 priority.\n\nE! News relays the words of Huck in regard to Kardashian\u2019s plan to expand her family, stating \u201cHer life has now become her kids. That is her No. 1 priority. So it makes sense that she would want to have a bigger family.\u201d\n\nHuck goes on to admit that he is not aware of Kardashian\u2019s plan fully to add a new little one to the Kardashian-West clan, but that he believes the mother of two has grown the most out the of famous family, adding \u201cKim as a mother, that I think has been the biggest transition.\u201d\n\nThe publication reminds that in April Kim sought advice from doctors to determine if becoming pregnant again would be safe, and recently she and Kanye opted to hire a surrogate after Kim\u2019s doctor advised not to get pregnant again.\n\nOn an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians the reality star admitted that hiring a surrogate is now her reality.\n\nEven with a life as public as hers, @KimKardashian still has a few unknown fun facts left. https://t.co/2TfJmtLBjf \u2014 Vogue Runway (@VogueRunway) August 25, 2017\n\n\u201cAfter talking to Kanye, I think that I always knew that surrogacy was an option, but I didn\u2019t think it was that realistic of an option. Now, I feel like that\u2019s my reality,\u201d Kim said when asked about surrogacy by older sister Kourtney.\n\nEeee! @KimKardashian has confirmed she and Kanye are \u201cdefinitely trying\u201d for baby number three! https://t.co/q4S40vj8Vn \u2014 Capital (@CapitalOfficial) August 19, 2017\n\nAt this point, Kardashian has reportedly found a surrogate, as TMZ noted, through an agency and she and Kanye determined that they would pay $45,000 for the procedure. The payment will be made in monthly installments of $4,500 and if multiple children result, the surrogate will be paid $5,000 for each additional child.\n\n[Featured Image By Mike Coppola/Getty Images]", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2421769f-57a4-4bff-913f-cf316747493e.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20157'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7c579880583dd6b39bd9186b37bc2101?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20492%20142'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo-white.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent-Dark-Mode.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20120%20120'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/kim-k-ready-for-baby-no-3-bff-says-more-kids-makes-sense-surrogate-hired", "title": "Kim K Ready For Baby No. 3, BFF Says More Kids \u2018Makes Sense\u2019 Surrogate Hired", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.png", "description": "Kim Kardashian clearly loves being a mother to her two little ones North and Saint, and despite a number of health issues during both pregnancies, and", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim K Ready For Baby No. 3, BFF Says More Kids \u2018Makes Sense\u2019 Surrogate Hired - Inquisitr News", "description": "Kim Kardashian clearly loves being a mother to her two little ones North and Saint, and despite a number of health issues during both pregnancies, and", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/kim-k-ready-for-baby-no-3-bff-says-more-kids-makes-sense-surrogate-hired", "site_name": "Inquisitr News"}, "article": {"tag": "pregnancy", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-08-25T08:53:00-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kim K Ready For Baby No. 3, BFF Says More Kids \u2018Makes Sense\u2019 Surrogate Hired - Inquisitr News", "description": "Kim Kardashian clearly loves being a mother to her two little ones North and Saint, and despite a number of health issues during both pregnancies, and", "site": "@theinquisitr", "creator": "@theinquisitr"}, "generator": "WP Rocket 3.18.3"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503665580.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
