That seemed weird.' And that's how I dismissed it. I was like, \u2018Well, this isn't a thing. Like, it's not that big of a deal. Buck up, Faris. Like, just giggle.' But it made me feel small. He wouldn't have done that to the lead male.\"\n\nFaris was joined by guest Arielle Kebbel (UnREAL, Ballers) to discuss the growing issues of sexual harassment and abuse in the workplace and how men can help fix the problems.\n\nKarwai Tang/WireImage\n\n\"We're conditioned to giggle,\" says Faris. \"But also, if we were to do anything else, we'd be labeled a bitch or difficult. That would be the best of circumstances. I guess what I do is I laugh. It puts everyone at ease. That's the defense mode you go into.\"\n\nFaris, whose book, Unqualified, is out today, later brought the conversation back to her uncomfortable on-set experience. This time revealing how she purportedly landed the role.\n\n\"I remember that same director telling my agent, who told me, that I had great legs and that was one of the reasons that I got hired,\" she recalled. \"And listen, that's a f\u2014ing great compliment. I like my legs. But that sort of informed my whole experience with that whole project. I don't think the male lead got hired because he had great legs. Therefore I felt like I'm hired because of these elements \u2014 not because of [talent].\" <iframe sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-popups\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"185\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://embed.radiopublic.com/e?if=anna-faris-is-unqualified-585ax8&ge=s1!5785eeffd045fa46d2d187dac19c93f079eacdac\" class=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" resize=\"0\" replace_attributes=\"1\" name=\"\"></iframe>\u00db\u00bd|\u00f3^t\u00e7~|\u00ef\u00de\u00f3^=k\u00bf\u00f7\u00b7\u00da\u00c7\u00fak\u00d7_\u00e9\u00c7t\n\nFaris' comments arrive in the wake of women speaking out in light of the sexual misconduct allegations against disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.
