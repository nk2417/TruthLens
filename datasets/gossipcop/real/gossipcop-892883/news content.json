The story is loosely based on the historical mystery revolving around the disappearance of Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna after a fateful night in 1916. Fox had previously adapted the story into a live-action film starring Ingrid Bergman and Yul Brynner in 1956.\n\nAnastasia went on to earn $139 million, receive two Oscar nominations and even inspire a stage adaptation of the musical film that premiered on Broadway in April 2017.\n\nTo celebrate the legacy of the 20th anniversary of the film's release, The Hollywood Reporter travels on a quick \"journey to the past\" to track the careers of the voice actors who brought Anastasia to life once upon a November.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/anastasia_1997_001_1_copy_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/j.k._simmons_and_anastasia_ensemble_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/hank_azaria_and_bartok_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kelsey_grammer_and_vlad_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/christopher_lloyd_and_rasputin_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lacey_chabert_and_young_singing_anastasia_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/angela_lansbury_and_the_dowager_empress_marie_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/liz_callaway_and_singing_anastasia_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kirsten_dunst_and_young_anastasia_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/bernadette_peters_and_sophie_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/john_cusack_and_dimitri_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/meg_ryan_and_anastasia_-_split_-_photofest_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/anastasia_1997_001_1_copy_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tara Bitran", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/cast-anastasia-1060209/", "title": "The Cast of \u2018Anastasia,\u2019 Then and Now", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Twenty years ago, a cast of star-studded greats lent their voices to the tale of an ill-fated Russian princess with a happy ending in Fox Animation's first feature.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Tara Bitran", "tags": "Then and Now", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "The Cast of \u2018Anastasia,\u2019 Then and Now", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/cast-anastasia-1060209/", "description": "Twenty years ago, a cast of star-studded greats lent their voices to the tale of an ill-fated Russian princess with a happy ending in Fox Animation's first feature.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/anastasia_1997_001_1_copy_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "The Cast of 'Anastasia,' Then and Now"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-21T06:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-10-23T15:04:21+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Twenty years ago, a cast of star-studded greats lent their voices to the tale of an ill-fated Russian princess with a happy ending in Fox Animation's first feature.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Cast of \u2018Anastasia,\u2019 Then and Now", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/anastasia_1997_001_1_copy_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511244000.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
