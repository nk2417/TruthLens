The ceremony will take place on June 6 at Omaha Beach, and will honor the thousands of American, British, and Canadian troops who landed at the beach on D-Day.\n\nThe battles on D-Day, which began on June 6, 1944, were crucial in pushing back German forces and bringing about the end of World War II.\n\nApart from international leaders, D-Day veterans will attend a commemorative ceremony hosted by the Canadian government at the Juno Beach Centre, in the French town of Courseulles-sur-Mer, Buckingham Palace has announced.\n\nWhile King Charles and Queen Camilla will join William on June 5 at the U.K.\u2019s national D-Day commemorative event in Portsmouth, England, the prince will attend the Canadian commemorative ceremony and the international commemorative ceremony on June 6 alone. On that day, the king and queen consort are expected to attend the Ministry of Defence and the Royal British Legion\u2019s commemorative event at the British Normandy Memorial to mark the anniversary, as the monarch is patron of the Royal British Legion.\n\nPrincess Kate will not be attending the anniversary ceremonies, as she has said she will return to public-facing royal duties only when she is allowed to do so by her doctors.", "images": ["https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523000000&id=social-button-icon",
