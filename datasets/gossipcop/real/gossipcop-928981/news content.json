{"url": "https://people.com/country/carrie-underwood-shares-close-up-face-photo-revealing-scars/", "text": "After suffering a scary accident in November that left her with over 40 stitches to her face and a broken right wrist, Carrie Underwood is showing off her scars.\n\nOn Friday, the country star shared a close-up picture on social media of her face \u2014 which showed the singer\u2019s scars around her upper lip and chin \u2014 while supporting her husband, Mike Fisher, and his hockey team, the Nashville Predators.\n\n\u201cReady to cheer on the boys tonight! Especially that #12! I hear he\u2019s alright! \ud83d\ude18 @mfisher1212 @predsnhl#LetsGoPreds,\u201d Underwood, 35, captioned the snap, which featured the singer rocking a white and orange Predators hat and making a pair of fangs with her fingers.\n\nDuring an appearance on iHeartRadio\u2019s The Bobby Bones Show on Thursday, Underwood gave details of her accident for the first time, explaining that she fell from the stairs of her Nashville home when she went to take her dogs out for a quick walk at night.\n\n\u201cI was taking the dogs out to go pee one last time, and I just \u2014 I tripped,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was one step, and I didn\u2019t let go of the leashes! Priorities! So that\u2019s why my left hand\u2019s fine. But I went to catch myself and I just missed a step.\u201d\n\nAdded Underwood: \u201cIf I had fallen anywhere else, I would have been perfectly fine. But it was one step that messed everything up.\u201d\n\nThe American Idol alum went on to say that she was \u201cvery fortunate in the healing process,\u201d but nervous that it wasn\u2019t going to be that way.\n\n\u201cI was at a point where I didn\u2019t know how things were going to end up,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going to go on. I didn\u2019t know what it was going to heal like. \u2026 You just don\u2019t know how things are going to heal or end up.\u201d\n\nFor Underwood, who\u2019s right-handed, the recovery process was tough since she had to adjust her handwriting.\n\n\u201cIt set me back,\u201d shared Underwood. \u201cThe most frustrating part was trying to work out with a broken wrist, and just how much it can throw off your world, having an appendage that is there, but you just can\u2019t use it.\u201d\n\nAnd while the \u201cJesus Take the Wheel\u201d singer took some time off from social media and wasn\u2019t posting any photos or selfies after the accident, she insists she wasn\u2019t hiding.\n\n\u201cI mean, I don\u2019t think I hide. There\u2019s always stuff to do, even if it\u2019s not necessarily playing shows. But, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m kind of a homebody,\u201d she said. \u201cI was lucky that when it happened everything was shutting down in the music world \u2014 we had the holidays.\u201d\n\nEthan Miller/Getty\n\nWant to keep up with the latest from PEOPLE?

Thank you.\u201d", "images":
