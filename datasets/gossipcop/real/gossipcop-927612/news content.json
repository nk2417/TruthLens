He first gained recognition for his contract role as Blackie Parrish on the ABC television soap opera General Hospital, for which he was nominated for the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at the 10th Daytime Emmy Awards in 1983. He is known for his work in television, especially in his starring role as Jesse Katsopolis on the ABC sitcom Full House. Since the show's finale in 1995, Stamos has appeared in numerous TV films and series.\n\nFrom 2005 to 2009, Stamos had a starring role on the NBC medical drama ER as Dr. Tony Gates. After Broadway stints in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying and Cabaret, Stamos began playing the role of Albert Peterson in the Broadway revival of Bye Bye Birdie, which he starred in from October 2009 to January 2010. He then played Senator Joseph Cantwell in a Broadway revival of Gore Vidal's play The Best Man from July to September 2012, replacing Eric McCormack.[2]\n\nFrom September 2015 to 2016, Stamos starred as the lead character in the Fox sitcom Grandfathered. He executive produced the Netflix series Fuller House, in which he reprised the role of Jesse Katsopolis. He also starred in Never Too Young to Die (1986), Born to Ride (1991), and as Dr. Nicky in the Lifetime/Netflix psychological thriller You.\n\nEarly life\n\nJohn Stamos was born on August 19, 1963, in Cypress, California, to William \"Bill\" Stamos, a second-generation Greek-American restaurateur originating from the village of Kakouri[3] in Arcadia[4] and Loretta (n\u00e9e Phillips). His original family surname is Stamatopoulos (Greek: \u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2).[5]\n\nIn his youth, Stamos worked for his father's restaurants, and as a teenager, had a job flipping burgers in the Orange County area. He attended John F. Kennedy High School and played in the marching band there. At 15, he attended his first Beach Boys concert; a huge fan, he would later tour with the band. His parents were supportive of his aspiration to be an actor, and although he planned to enroll at Cypress College for the 1981 term, he skipped his first semester to focus on launching a career as an actor\u2014with his father's blessing. After just three weeks, he landed his first role on General Hospital.[6]\n\nActing career\n\n1982\u20131986: Early career\n\nStamos began his acting career with the role of Blackie Parrish on the soap opera General Hospital in late January 1982, for which he was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series at the 10th Daytime Emmy Awards in 1983. That April, he went on to the lead role in the short-lived CBS sitcom Dreams, in which he played Gino Minnelli, an aspiring musician in a band of the same name. Later, he was a series regular on the sitcom You Again? (1986) with Jack Klugman. In 1986, Stamos starred in his first film Never Too Young to Die, an action spy film also starring Kiss bassist Gene Simmons. Though intended to be a \"young James Bond\" film (and even starred former Bond actor George Lazenby as Drew Stargrove, the father of Stamos' character Lance Stargrove), the movie was a critical and commercial flop.[7]\n\n1987\u20131995: Full House\n\nStamos at the 1990 Grammy Awards\n\nIn the late 1980s, ABC's Full House gradually became a hit, and the show solidified Stamos's career. He asked that his character's last name be changed from Cochran to Katsopolis to highlight his Greek heritage, according to show creator and executive producer Jeff Franklin. He played one of the show's protagonists, Jesse, who lives with his brother-in-law, Danny Tanner (Bob Saget), whose deceased wife Pam Tanner (Christine Houser) was Jesse's older sister. Danny's best friend, Joey Gladstone (Dave Coulier), also lives in the house with them. The three help each other raise Danny's three young daughters D.J. (Candace Cameron), Stephanie (Jodie Sweetin) and Michelle Tanner (Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen). Jesse is known to be the \"bad boy\" at first until he falls in love with and marries Rebecca Donaldson (Lori Loughlin) and has twin boys, Nicky and Alex Katsopolis (Blake and Dylan Tuomy-Wilhoit). In 1995, after eight seasons, the series came to an end. Stamos has since maintained close relationships with co-stars Bob Saget, Dave Coulier, Lori Loughlin, Jodie Sweetin, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen, Andrea Barber, and Candace Cameron Bure.\n\n1996\u20132009: Later career\n\nStamos has appeared in numerous made-for-television films, stage productions, television series, and commercials.
