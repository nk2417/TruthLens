Some people feel they are best suited to a gruelling workout, others \u2013 like the Kardashians \u2013 think differently; donning the super-tight separates as part of their glam wardrobe. In fact, many fashionistas have hailed the world's biggest reality family as the pioneers for the trend \u2013 giving it a new, modern edge. However, it was the late Diana, Princess of Wales who arguably wore the trend first \u2013 back in 1995. The stunning blonde was snapped leaving the Chelsea Harbour Club, looking like the poster girl for glam gym attire. Teaming her pair of orange cycling shorts with a close-fit, boxy sweatshirt, a black bag and trainers, she looked impossibly polished and fans at the time went wild for her dressed-down look. We wonder if the mother of Princes William and Harry knew at the time they would become one of 2018's most-talked about fashion item?\n\n\u00a9 Photo: PA\n\nPrincess Diana wore cycling shorts in 1995\n\nKim Kardashian's cycling shorts attract so much attention, they deserve their own Instagram account.
