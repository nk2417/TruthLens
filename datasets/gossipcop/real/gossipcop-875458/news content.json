Previously announced cast members were Olympians Adam Rippon, Jamie Anderson, Jennie Finch, and Tonya Harding.\n\nRounding out the list of 10 athletes are Josh Norman, Arike Ogunbowale, Chris Mazdzer, Johnny Damon, Mirai Nagasu, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nLindsay Arnold is returning to defend her title after winning last season with musician Jordan Fisher. The professional dancers joining her are Sharna Burgess, Witney Carson, Emma Slater, Jenna Johnson, Gleb Savchenko, Artem Chigvintsev, Keo Motsepe, Alan Bersten, and Sasha Farber.\n\nLen Goodman, Carrie Ann Inaba, and Bruno Tonioli will be back at the judges\u2019 table, and Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews will return as hosts.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising the ABC competition series is focusing on athletes this season given the continued success of athletes on the show such as past winners Emmitt Smith, Apolo Anton Ohno, Kristi Yamaguchi, Shawn Johnson, and Laurie Hernandez.\n\nThe new season of \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d premieres April 30 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC. This season will be the shortest to date for the series, lasting only four weeks with double eliminations every week.\n\nThe full pairings are below:\n\nAdam Rippon with Jenna Johnson\n\nArike Ogunbowale with Gleb Savchenko\n\nChris Mazdzer with Witney Carson\n\nJamie Anderson with Artem Chigvintsev\n\nJennie Finch Daigle with Keo Motsepe\n\nJohnny Damon with Emma Slater\n\nJosh Norman with Sharna Burgess\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar with Lindsay Arnold\n\nMirai Nagasu with Alan Bersten\n\nTonya Harding with Sasha Farber\n\nPOPULAR VIDEO ON VARIETY", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dancing-with-the-stars-season-26-split.jpg?w=1000&h=564&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dancing-with-the-stars-season-26-split.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dancing-with-the-stars-season-26-split.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ariana Brockington", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/dancing-with-the-stars-season-26-cast-1202752402/", "title": "\u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019 Season 26 Cast Revealed", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d revealed the contestants for its special 26th season which features a cast full of athletes.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Ariana Brockington", "tags": "Adam Rippon, Dancing With The Stars, Tonya Harding", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019 Season 26 Cast Revealed", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/dancing-with-the-stars-season-26-cast-1202752402/", "description": "\u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d revealed the contestants for its special 26th season which features a cast full of athletes.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dancing-with-the-stars-season-26-split.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "'Dancing With the Stars' Season 26 Cast Revealed"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-13T13:13:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-13T16:01:53+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d revealed the contestants for its special 26th season which features a cast full of athletes.", "site": "@variety", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019 Season 26 Cast Revealed", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dancing-with-the-stars-season-26-split.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523625228.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
