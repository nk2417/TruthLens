But when Tiffany Haddish said she wanted to get her money's worth out of the Alexander McQueen dress she bought for the premiere of Girl's Trip back when she hosted the show in November 2017, she really wasn\u2019t kidding. Not only did she wear it to deliver her SNL monologue, but she brought it out again to present at the 2018 Oscars.\n\nAs Haddish explained on SNL (where she made history as the first black female comedian to ever host the show, by the way), the $4,000 gown, which she wore to the Girl's Trip red carpet in July 2017, cost more than her mortgage\u2014it\u2019s only right that she re-wear it for special occasions.", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/thegiftshop.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690bc62f4b1b6e740126d5b5/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined",
