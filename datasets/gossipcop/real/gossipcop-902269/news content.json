But leaking a \"sex tape\" with her fianc\u00e9 Offset right after leaking a nude video? This might be a little too much for the Internet to handle. https://cdn.jwplayer.com/previews/I5oSXwmg-RWJWRJ4N When it comes to setting social media alight, Cardi B seems to always know what she is doing. Working on a new single and want it to come out with a spark? Leak a nude video as an appetizer, and then watch your single climb up the Billboard charts! Want to shut down the cheating rumors circulating around your beau? Leak a celeb sex tape with the guy!\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nMore: Rapper Cardi B In Sex Tape Storm - RadarOnline.com Online Yep, releasing NFSW content always seems to be the perfect solution\u2014at least for Cardi B. Given that Cardi used to be a stripper before she became part of rap\u2019s ruling class, exposing boobs and other private areas isn\u2019t a big deal for the raptress. However, the Internet still debates about whether Cardi B became the latest victim of hackers or if it was the rap sensation herself who leaked her nude videos to stir up some controversy and give her single \u201cBartier Cardi\u201d an adrenaline boost (in other words, pull the Kim Kardashian card).\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhatever the case, it doesn\u2019t matter as long as naughty Internet users have plenty of X-rated clips featuring the stripper-turned-recording star. As they say, give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Give him nude pics or a sex tape, and the dude won\u2019t even have time to eat, let alone to speculate about who leaked it (someone has said that, right?). Every sex tape leak happens for a reason or for no reason at all, which is why RadarOnline.com has investigated the infamous Cardi B nude video leak that is making rounds on the Internet. So what\u2019s so special about these super NSFW videos that are floating around? Let\u2019s find out!\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWho is Cardi B?\n\nIf you\u2019re here to watch Cardi B\u2019s sex tape online, but you have no clue who this girl is, \u2018memba the lyrics \u201cYou can\u2019t f*ck with me if you wanted to\u201d from a hit 2017 song? If it still doesn\u2019t ring a bell, here\u2019s a hint: \u201cBodak Yellow.\u201d What? Still nothing? It\u2019s the iconic debut single by Cardi B that won Single of the Year at the 2017 BET Hip Hop Awards and earned two Grammy awards in 2018.\n\nIn case you\u2019re wondering how huge of a hit \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d was, it went triple platinum and even landed on the No. 1 spot of the Billboard Hot 100 chart, knocking Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d from the top. Although Cardi B rose to international fame in 2017, she had been an influential social media personality years prior to her musical debut. Before pursuing a musical career, Cardi, whose real name is Belcalis Almanzar, was a stripper for five years. The stripper-turned-rapper retired at 23 when her popularity on social media soared to dizzying heights.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nCardi B is also known for her \u201cno filter attitude\u201d in both lyrics and social media posts, which helps her throw her name into the spotlight every once in a while. But when she truly wants to make a splash in the music industry, it\u2019s pretty obvious that leaking a sex tape attracts media coverage at a much stronger magnitude than dissing a fellow rapper does.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWho is Cardi B engaged to?\n\nCardi B is engaged to Offset, born as Kiari Kendrell Cephus, who is best known as a member of the chart-topping hip-hop trio Migos. After nearly a year of their infamous on-again, off-again relationship, Cardi and Offset got engaged in October 2017.\n\nThe duo, who collaborated on a music video together, even had a quickie breakup shortly before their engagement. The rapper popped the question during a Power 99 Powerhouse concert in Philadelphia. Cardi said yes and couldn\u2019t stop showing off the impressive $550k engagement ring for several weeks after the public proposal.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nHow did Cardi\u2019s XXX-mas happen?\n\nCardi B dropped her second single, \u201cBartier Cardi\u201d featuring 21 Savage, in late December 2018\u2014just in time for Christmas. But this wasn\u2019t the reason why search engines had a massive influx of Cardi B queries that day. The thing is, on the same day, a sexy video displaying Cardi B dancing nude leaked online.\n\nWhether or not it was part of Cardi\u2019s elaborate PR strategy, she exposed more than her fans asked for. Hot on the heels of the nude video leak, Cardi B took to Instagram to share an explicit sex tape allegedly showing her and fianc\u00e9 Offset getting intimate.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe sex tape and Cardi B\u2019s nude video leak was branded \u201cXXX-mas tape.\u201d\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWas Cardi B nude and did she leak the video?\n\nThe rap sensation\u2019s name truly dominated headlines in late December 2018, and some fans were convinced that the so-called \u201cleaks\u201d were a PR stunt to help catapult \u201cBartier Cardi\u201d to the top of the charts. And believe it or not, it worked. The X-rated video showing Cardi B bending over and twerking in the nude was practically released as a side dish to her single, and many argued that the leak was the raptress\u2019s attempt to derail buzz from the cheating rumors. Shortly before \u201cBartier Cardi\u201d\u2014and the sex tape, for that matter\u2014dropped, reports surfaced claiming that Cardi\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Offset, cheated on the singer.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nCardi wasn\u2019t about to let the rumors sabotage the success of her latest single, which is why she recorded herself and Offset having sex live on Instagram\u2026sort of.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s so sexy about the XXX-mas leak?\n\nIn the nude video, a naked woman resembling Cardi was seen smiling, laughing, twerking and bending over for the camera. The X-rated clip, which immediately made its way on PornHub, was allegedly captured in a hotel room, and many think it was recorded with Offset\u2019s phone (and his iCloud account was reportedly hacked that month). In the X-rated footage, the woman flaunts a similar tattoo to Cardi\u2019s upper thigh ink. Cardi even equivocally confirmed that it was her on the video when laughing off the leak on social media.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nClearly, Cardi B was unfazed by the nude vid leak (and why wouldn\u2019t she, considering that many believe she was the one who leaked the clip?). In the tweet, the \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d hitmaker reminded followers that she used to be a stripper and pointed out that there are a plethora of videos of her stripping with her \u201ctitties and a** out\u201d on YouTube. In true Cardi fashion, she also used the opportunity to pat herself on the back.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nPeople keep posting the nude videos of me like if i wasn\u2019t a stripper before \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0fYou know there\u2019s videos of me stripping with my titties & ass out on YouTube already right \ud83d\ude02?anyways i know i know i got a nice body right \ud83d\ude0e \u2014 iamcardib (@iamcardib) December 25, 2017\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nCardi B & Offset sex tape: real or fake?\n\nIn an apparent attempt to shut down the cheating rumors circulating around her beau, Cardi B shared a racy video of herself and Offset simulating sex. At first, fans thought the duo were actually having sex in the live video, but she later confirmed that the whole thing was a joke\u2026or was it? In the live video, which was actively peddled by the media as a \u201csex tape,\u201d Cardi B and Offset are seen rocking their bodies back and forth. The Migos rapper was standing behind his hunched-over fianc\u00e9e, and it did look like they were really putting a lot of effort into it. The video stirred up some controversy and helped Cardi end the year with a spark. Above all, it did steal the media\u2019s attention away from the cheating rumors.\n\nNever Miss an Daily updates from the heart of Hollywood, right to your inbox By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you\u2019re agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

But there were still quite a few of those who refused to believe that the viral video, in which Cardi B and Offset are seen dry-humping each other, was not an actual video of the lovebirds getting intimate. Frustrated, the \u201cBartier Cardi\u201d hitmaker took to Instagram stories and Twitter to respond to the doubters.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cI was fully clothes on live, I was not f*king on live! Yaaa can\u2019t be that slow!\u201d Cardi wrote in an Instagram Story. Then on Twitter, the rap sensation reiterated that the \u201csex tape\u201d was fake.\n\nIf anybody watch the live from last night they can see from beginning to end that i was talking then this guy came behind me and started fake dry humping me \u201cJesus Christ we Both had pants on !!\ud83d\ude44 \u2014 iamcardib (@iamcardib) December 27, 2017\n\nCardi\u2019s fans were divided about the leak. Some rushed to her defense, while others slammed her for being too desperate for attention. Despite the wild reaction in the media, those weren\u2019t the first NSFW videos with Cardi B. If you take matters into your own hands (no pun intended), and search for other racy videos of Cardi B, you will see quite a few of them online. However, Cardi\u2019s identity has not been verified in many of these nude clips, so let\u2019s not jump to conclusions.", "images":
