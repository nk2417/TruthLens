He and his friends, other Roc Nation executives, spent about $13,000, according to Page Six.\n\nThe tabloid also reported that the group later went to Manhattan's Made in Mexico Mexican restaurant and spent $9,000 on drinks.\n\nThe last stop was Playroom nightclub, where Page Six reported Jay was seen handing out bottles of his own Ace of Spades Champagne to tables. His group paid full price for 40 bottles of the drink.\n\nPeople reported that a server posted a photo of the tab at Playroom, showing the bottles totaled more than $80,000. The group left an $11,100 tip.\n\nRelated video: Jay-Z and Beyonce Through The Years", "images": ["https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/logos/AJC/logo-white.svg?d=2167", "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/WFZYWIH3Y65EHBZFPHBT7XCQDQ.jpg?auth=12d976d0229e8e60230800540a62cc538eef73e52a4fac6144e0662234fa4af0&width=790&height=440&smart=true", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/icons/search-burger.svg?d=2167", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/logos/AJC/logo-short.svg?d=2167", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/logos/AJC/logo-full-redesign.svg?d=2167", "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/S2UT2ZHLZJH2JBHYLCHDVOMLWY.jpg?auth=9f47be3f17f0e5ba0dca4246f74e6fbdd20a4bda2881fb21513d019794e92123&width=500&height=500&smart=true", "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/MOSBRF73KVEDHGSEPI4NIU5TRA.jpg?auth=5192ad2fa362f5a990aebad2d8f3cb40d0d3aa983a12c7fc7f6b98ce099a2be5&width=950&height=950&smart=true", "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/WFZYWIH3Y65EHBZFPHBT7XCQDQ.jpg?auth=12d976d0229e8e60230800540a62cc538eef73e52a4fac6144e0662234fa4af0&width=1200&height=630&smart=true"], "top_img": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/WFZYWIH3Y65EHBZFPHBT7XCQDQ.jpg?auth=12d976d0229e8e60230800540a62cc538eef73e52a4fac6144e0662234fa4af0&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/jay-leaves-000-tip-000-bar-tab-for-friend-birthday-celebration/qnYM1Swt8wtaGlJmMaMwaJ/", "title": "JAY-Z leaves $11,000 tip on $80,000 bar tab for friend\u2019s birthday celebration", "meta_data": {"description": "JAY-Z reportedly spent big at a New York bar over the weekend.", "feedinclude": "true", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "JAY-Z reportedly spent big at a New York bar over the weekend.", "image": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/WFZYWIH3Y65EHBZFPHBT7XCQDQ.jpg?auth=12d976d0229e8e60230800540a62cc538eef73e52a4fac6144e0662234fa4af0&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "site": "@ajc", "title": "JAY-Z leaves $11,000 tip on $80,000 bar tab for friend\u2019s birthday celebration", "url": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/jay-leaves-000-tip-000-bar-tab-for-friend-birthday-celebration/qnYM1Swt8wtaGlJmMaMwaJ/"}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2018-02-21T21:04:57Z"}, "url": "https://www.ajc.com/TU34OPSDK5ZCIWK2IPRLIEVXIU"}, "fb": {"app_id": 366816260017522, "pages": 13310147298}, "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/WFZYWIH3Y65EHBZFPHBT7XCQDQ.jpg?auth=12d976d0229e8e60230800540a62cc538eef73e52a4fac6144e0662234fa4af0&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "secure_url": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/WFZYWIH3Y65EHBZFPHBT7XCQDQ.jpg?auth=12d976d0229e8e60230800540a62cc538eef73e52a4fac6144e0662234fa4af0&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "title": "JAY-Z leaves $11,000 tip on $80,000 bar tab for friend\u2019s birthday celebration", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/jay-leaves-000-tip-000-bar-tab-for-friend-birthday-celebration/qnYM1Swt8wtaGlJmMaMwaJ/", "description": "JAY-Z reportedly spent big at a New York bar over the weekend.", "site_name": "ajc"}, "thumbnail": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/WFZYWIH3Y65EHBZFPHBT7XCQDQ.jpg?auth=12d976d0229e8e60230800540a62cc538eef73e52a4fac6144e0662234fa4af0&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "language": "English", "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "story.meter": "premium", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=414120752, app-argument=https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/jay-leaves-000-tip-000-bar-tab-for-friend-birthday-celebration/qnYM1Swt8wtaGlJmMaMwaJ/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.ajc.com", "summary": ""}
