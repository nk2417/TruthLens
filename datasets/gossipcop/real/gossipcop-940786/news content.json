According to the suit, she made a video recording of the encounter on her laptop. As she explained the company\u2019s services, she alleges that Weinstein began to caress her legs. He promised to make a deal that afternoon if she would meet him for a drink at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, the suit alleges. Once there, he brought her to his hotel room, where the alleged rape occurred.\n\nThe complaint also alleges that Thompson sought help from the law firm of Benjamin Brafman last fall, and turned over her video evidence to the firm not realizing that Brafman was representing Weinstein.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nA second woman, actress Caitlin Dulany, also alleged that Weinstein sexually assaulted her at the Hotel du Cap in Cannes in 1996. Dulany earlier told a version of her encounter in a first-person account for the Wrap, though she did not mention the alleged assault. In the suit, Dulany alleges that Weinstein performed oral sex on her without her consent and then masturbated.\n\nThe third plaintiff, actress Larissa Gomes, alleges that Weinstein cornered her in a hotel room in Toronto in 2000, tried to get her to give him a massage and asked to see her breast. She recoiled, and Weinstein became angry.\n\n\u201cYou know Gwyneth Paltrow and Ashley Judd were exactly where you are at one point,\u201d Gomes quotes him as saying. \u201cLook at them now. Ashley Judd had no problem f\u2014ing me.\u201d (Judd and Paltrow have both alleged that Weinstein made unwanted advances toward them.)\n\nAccording to Gomes, she tried to get away, saying \u201cI think I should go now, my boyfriend is waiting for me, and he will be worried.\u201d\n\nGomes alleges that Weinstein forcibly tried to kiss her, before she fled.\n\nThe women are represented by Hagens Berman and the Armenta Law Firm, which also filed an earlier class action suit against Weinstein on behalf of six other women. The suit names Miramax, the Walt Disney Co., and Weinstein as defendants, along with individual board members of the Weinstein Co.\n\nWeinstein has consistently denied all allegations of non-consensual sex. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of rape and criminal sexual acts in New York, and faces up to 25 years in prison on those charges.\n\nHis representative has yet to respond to the new allegations.\n\nWeinstein Miramax Class Action by gmaddaus on Scribd", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/weinstein.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/weinstein.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gene Maddaus", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/harvey-weinstein-class-action-suit-miramax-1202827781/", "title": "Harvey Weinstein Faces New Rape Allegation in Class Action Lawsuit", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Melissa Thompson alleges that Weinstein raped her after she tried to pitch a startup in 2011", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Gene Maddaus", "tags": "Harvey Weinstein, sensitive", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Harvey Weinstein Faces New Rape Allegation in Class Action Lawsuit", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/harvey-weinstein-class-action-suit-miramax-1202827781/", "description": "Melissa Thompson alleges that Weinstein raped her after she tried to pitch a startup in 2011", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/weinstein.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Harvey Weinstein"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-01T17:15:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-01T17:56:04+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Melissa Thompson alleges that Weinstein raped her after she tried to pitch a startup in 2011", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@GeneMaddaus", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Harvey Weinstein Faces New Rape Allegation in Class Action Lawsuit", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/weinstein.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527873351.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
