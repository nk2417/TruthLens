You were all so wonderful. My extended family (half of Beirut) loved it too. Thank you and have a great run. Love, George and Amal.\u201d\n\nThe sweet gesture was very much appreciated.\n\n\"This is better than fairy dust!\" Bethan wrote. \"A letter and flowers from George and Amal Clooney! Thank you!!!#georgeclooney #amalclooney #MyFairLady #showoftheweek #review @millatsonning @newmutinytheatreco #flowers #flowerstagram #fairydust #mademylife #actors #theatre #elizadolittle #thankful #thankyou.\"\n\nOn Dec. 27, Bethan revealed the A-list couple attended the show, calling them \"generous and humble.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time George and Amal have been thoughtful of others. Last month, they gave all of their fellow passengers on a plane headphones to cancel any noise their newborn twins, Ella and Alexander, would make. George's Casamigos co-founder, Rande Gerber, also revealed last month that the actor once gave 14 of his friends $1 million each as a surprise gift, and paid their taxes for the year.\n\nHear the incredible story below:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/cindy.jpg?h=33dcb2d9&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2016-04/1280_george_clooney_amal_clooney_GettyImages473029800.jpg?width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/george_clooney_amal_clooney_gettyimages_865229430.jpg?h=6abb419f&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/amalcloons.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/george_clooney_amal_clooney_gettyimages_865229430.jpg?h=6abb419f", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_102217_ClooneyOnKids720.png?h=9db51067&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/george_clooney_amal_clooney_gettyimages_865229430.jpg?h=6abb419f", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/george-and-amal-clooney-send-sweetest-note-after-theater-date-night-93996", "title": "George and Amal Clooney Send the Sweetest Note After Theater Date Night", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/george_clooney_amal_clooney_gettyimages_865229430.jpg?h=6abb419f", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "George and Amal Clooney are nothing if not thoughtful!", "title": "George and Amal Clooney Send the Sweetest Note After Theater Date Night", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/george-and-amal-clooney-send-sweetest-note-after-theater-date-night-93996", "type": "Article"}, "description": "George and Amal Clooney are nothing if not thoughtful!", "twitter": {"description": "George and Amal Clooney are nothing if not thoughtful!", "title": "George and Amal Clooney Send the Sweetest Note After Theater Date Night", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/george-and-amal-clooney-send-sweetest-note-after-theater-date-night-93996", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/george_clooney_amal_clooney_gettyimages_865229430.jpg?h=6abb419f", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "George and Amal Clooney Send the Sweetest Note After Theater Date Night | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , George Clooney, Amal Clooney", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
