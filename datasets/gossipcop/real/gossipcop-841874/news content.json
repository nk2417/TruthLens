Just classic. \u201cIt puts the lotion on \u2026\u201d\n\nThe video has been up for just a few hours and already has more than 75,000 views.\n\nAlso cool, the new video is dedicated to the late Carrie Fisher.\n\nUpdate: On Thursday evening, the video was removed, with this notice posted on YouTube: \u201cThis video is no longer available due to a copyright claim by Dramatists Play Service.\u201d The Bad Lip Reading Twitter account addressed the takedown. As of Friday morning the video had returned online and things were back to normal.\n\nHi everyone \u2014 working on getting the video back up. Was apparently some kind of clerical error, but the timing couldn\u2019t have been worse\u2026 https://t.co/ryft1CsVMN \u2014 Bad Lip Reading (@BadLipReading) April 7, 2017", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/markhamill.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/markhamill.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Parker", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/mark-hamill-does-an-outstanding-han-solo-bad-lip-reading-installment-991641/", "title": "Mark Hamill Does an Outstanding Han Solo in \u2018Bad Lip Reading\u2019 Installment", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The video has been up for just a few hours and already has more than 75,000 views.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Ryan Parker", "tags": "Mark Hamill, Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Mark Hamill Does an Outstanding Han Solo in \u2018Bad Lip Reading\u2019 Installment", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/mark-hamill-does-an-outstanding-han-solo-bad-lip-reading-installment-991641/", "description": "The video has been up for just a few hours and already has more than 75,000 views.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/markhamill.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "Mark Hamill Does an Outstanding Han Solo in 'Bad Lip Reading'"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-04-06T07:41:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-04-07T09:34:42+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The video has been up for just a few hours and already has more than 75,000 views.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mark Hamill Does an Outstanding Han Solo in \u2018Bad Lip Reading\u2019 Installment", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/markhamill.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sv_hGITmNuo"], "publish_date": 1491464465.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
