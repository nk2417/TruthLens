Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\n\nBrooks said he was sick, and in the midst of 12 shows in 10 days.\n\n\"We decided to lip-sync it because my voice was just not there, and we wanted to represent country music the best we can.\"\n\nTrue to his Entertainer of the Year title, Brooks has been touring and performing relentlessly. He played five concerts last weekend: one on Friday, two on Saturday and two on Sunday.", "images": ["https://www.tennessean.com/gciaf/prod/p?a=pageview&p=PNAS-TEALIUM-TANGENT&m=web&k=f14ebdd6-0569-4c64-af73-99937bc06379&s=noscript", "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/ac6a145307cb4f91adb519d3462fb8b239b232b0/c=0-12-3379-1921/local/-/media/2017/11/08/TennGroup/Nashville/636457731138692794-cma-2017177.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/ac6a145307cb4f91adb519d3462fb8b239b232b0/c=0-12-3379-1921/local/-/media/2017/11/08/TennGroup/Nashville/636457731138692794-cma-2017177.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/11/08/garth-brooks-admits-lip-syncing-cma-awards/847084001/", "title": "Garth Brooks admits to lip-syncing at CMA Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Garth Brooks admits to lip-syncing at CMA Awards", "description": "Brooks was sick on Wednesday and said he made a 'game-time' decision to lip-sync on the show.", "url": "https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/11/08/garth-brooks-admits-lip-syncing-cma-awards/847084001/", "site_name": "The Tennessean", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/ac6a145307cb4f91adb519d3462fb8b239b232b0/c=0-12-3379-1921/local/-/media/2017/11/08/TennGroup/Nashville/636457731138692794-cma-2017177.JPG?width=3200&height=1808&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1808}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Cindy Watts and Dave Paulson", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Brooks was sick on Wednesday and said he made a 'game-time' decision to lip-sync on the show.", "fb": {"pages": 42128399297, "app_id": 121487414583460}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/ac6a145307cb4f91adb519d3462fb8b239b232b0/c=0-12-3379-1921/local/-/media/2017/11/08/TennGroup/Nashville/636457731138692794-cma-2017177.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@tennessean", "creator": "@tennessean", "title": "Garth Brooks admits to lip-syncing at CMA Awards", "description": "Brooks was sick on Wednesday and said he made a 'game-time' decision to lip-sync on the show."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510117200.0, "source": "https://www.tennessean.com", "summary": ""}
