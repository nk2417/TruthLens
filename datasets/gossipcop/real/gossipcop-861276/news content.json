The kids played a slew of games together including archery tag before enjoying a bonfire, s\u2019mores and cake. Kate and her 16-year-old daughter Mady, who is twin to Cara, put their creative skills to the test decorating a large tent for the family.\n\nBut there was one notable absence: Kate\u2019s 13-year-old son Collin, who has been enrolled in a program away from home to help him reach his full potential since last summer.\n\n\u201cThirteen \u2014 need we say more?\u201d said Kate, 42, during an on-camera confessional after the sextuplets, minus Collin, gathered around the table to blow out their candles on their separate cakes.\n\n\u201cThe photos around the cake, I have them for every year, every child, every birthday,\u201d explained Kate. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely an iconic moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis year [was] much like last year,\u201d she continued. \u201cObviously the difference is that Collin wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am comforted with the fact that my kids, all of them, each unique child, is receiving exactly what they need and that hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve said that before, I\u2019ll say it again. It\u2019s a bittersweet moment [and] we\u2019ve had many of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t do anything without realizing he\u2019s missing,\u201d she added. \u201cSo we may not say it, but it\u2019s always there.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kate Gosselin Says Son Collin Is \u2018Getting Precisely What He Needs\u2019 at Live-in Learning Facility\n\nLast August, Kate exclusively opened up to PEOPLE about how she came to the decision to enroll Collin in the program away from home, which she said \u201cis helping him learn the skills he needs to be the best him he can be.\u201d\n\n\u201cCollin has special needs,\u201d the TLC star said. \u201c[There\u2019s] a fairly fluid diagnosis of what those needs are, but he needs to learn certain strategies to help him deal with things. This has been a struggle we\u2019ve had for a very long time, and it\u2019s one I\u2019ve dealt with on my own. I\u2019ve felt very alone in this. By the same token, it\u2019s not something that has only impacted me or him \u2013 our entire family has been impacted.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe miss him so much, so it\u2019s been hard because there is a huge hole in our family without him here,\u201d she added. \u201cBut it comforts us to know he\u2019s where he needs to be right now, and I can feel good about that.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Inside Sean \u2018Puff Daddy\u2019 Combs\u2019 Life At Home with Six Kids \u2014 \u2018I\u2019m the Luckiest Man in the World\u2019\n\nIn November, Kate told PEOPLE the program is helping Collin get \u201cprecisely what he needs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the road ahead entails, but I\u2019m very happy with the care that he\u2019s getting, and am still completely comforted by the fact that he is so clearly exactly where he needs to be,\u201d she said. \u201cIt comforts me as a mother \u2014 because when you, as a mom, can\u2019t give your kids what they need, it is a huge comfort to find people who can.\u201d\n\nKate Plus 8 airs Mondays (10 p.m. ET) on TLC.\n\nPut your celeb and pop culture knowledge to the test and download PEOPLE and Zynga\u2019s Crosswords with Friends!",
