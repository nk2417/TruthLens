But before he became known as Eugenie's husband, Brooksbank was an English socialite with several royal blood ties of his own.\n\nAhead, read everything to know about him.\n\nHe has a normal job.\n\nBrooksbank, born in London, has been involved in the hospitality industry over the years, working as a nightclub manager at Mahiki and brand ambassador for George Clooney's popular tequila brand, Casamigos. In 2022, he got a new job at Discovery Land Company, a development corporation based in Portugal. He and Eugenie now split their time between London and Portugal.\n\nDavid M. Benett // Getty Images\n\nHe met Eugenie on a ski trip.\n\nBack in 2010, 24-year-old Brooksbank first crossed paths with 20-year-old Princess Eugenie during a ski trip in Switzerland, where the two happened to be staying at the same resort.\n\nFollowing the news of their engagement in January 2018, Brooksbank told BBC that his meeting with Eugenie was \"love at first sight.\"\n\n\"We met when I was 20 and Jack was 24 and fell in love,\" Eugenie also told the news channel. \"We have the same passions and drive for life.\"\n\nThe two dated for over seven years before Brooksbank proposed in January 2018 during a vacation in Nicaragua. Later that year, on October 12, they tied the knot at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nHe is a distant cousin of Eugenie.\n\n\n\nMuch like the late Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip (who were third cousins), the royal spouses share distant blood ties as half-third cousins twice removed.\n\nBrooksbank's ties to Eugenie are tangentially royal, as his parents\u2014George Edward Hugh Brooksbank and Nicola Newton\u2014come from the Brooksbank baronetcy of the Baronetage of England, a British hereditary dignity considered lower in rank than barony but above knighthood (barring several exceptions, including the Knights of the Garter in England and Scotland).\n\nHe does not have a royal title.\n\nDespite descending from British nobility and later marrying into the British royal family, Brooksbank does not have a royal title of his own.\n\nAs a baronet descended, Brooksbank comes from the only class of British nobility not part of the peerage, the ranks of which consist (in descending order of precedence) of duke, marquess, earl, viscount, and baron. Royal historian Marlene Koenig told Town and Country, \"There is no precedent for giving a peerage to the commoner husband of a princess on the wedding day.\"\n\nHe has a child with Eugenie, with one more on the way.\n\nBrooksbank and Eugenie share two-year-old son August Philip Hawke Brooksbank, who, like his father, does not have a royal title. The two are also expecting their second child\u2014a daughter\u2014later this summer.", "images":
