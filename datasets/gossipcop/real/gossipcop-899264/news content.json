Both Camila Cabello and Lindsay Lohan shamelessly fangirled over Taylor Swift, posting separate videos of themselves during the pop star\u2019s performance to social media later that evening.\n\nLohan shared a video of herself dancing near the front barricade to \u201cShake It Off,\u201d even using the hashtag #Swifties to declare her part in the fandom.\n\nFrom practically the same spot in the crowd, Cabello shared an all-too-relatable video to her Snapchat story screaming in joy as she watched Swift perform. Cabello also shared a still photo, captioned, \u201cI cried.\u201d\n\nSwift closed out the star-studded night at Madison Square Garden, telling the crowd \u201cWe\u2019ll see you on tour\u201d and reminding fans of the stadium trek she\u2019ll be embarking on next summer. Considering Swift\u2019s laundry list of A-list buds and the two unabashed Swift-loving stars at just one performance, this likely won\u2019t be the last we see of celebs showing their Swiftie side.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Camila-Cabello-02-jingle-ball-performance-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Camila-Cabello-02-jingle-ball-performance-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Allison Stubblebine", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/taylor-swift-jingle-ball-nyc-performance-camila-cabello-lindsay-lohan-tweets-8062881/", "title": "Camila Cabello and Lindsay Lohan Were Taylor Swift\u2019s Biggest Fans at iHeartRadio\u2019s Jingle Ball in NYC", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Camila Cabello and Lindsay Lohan are secret Swifties.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Allison Stubblebine", "tags": "Lindsay Lohan", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Camila Cabello and Lindsay Lohan Were Taylor Swift\u2019s Biggest Fans at iHeartRadio\u2019s Jingle Ball in NYC", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/taylor-swift-jingle-ball-nyc-performance-camila-cabello-lindsay-lohan-tweets-8062881/", "description": "Camila Cabello and Lindsay Lohan are secret Swifties.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Camila-Cabello-02-jingle-ball-performance-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Camila Cabello"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-11T14:54:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-11-15T15:40:49+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Camila Cabello and Lindsay Lohan are secret Swifties.", "site": "@billboard", "creator": "@MsAllyMackenzie", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Camila Cabello and Lindsay Lohan Were Taylor Swift\u2019s Biggest Fans at iHeartRadio\u2019s Jingle Ball in NYC", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Camila-Cabello-02-jingle-ball-performance-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513004063.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
