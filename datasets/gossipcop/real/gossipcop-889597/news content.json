The product in question? An underwear-clad blow-up doll with Kimmel\u2019s face.\n\nDeGeneres asked Damon a series of leading questions about the product, and the Cambridge native\u2019s answers left the audience in hysterics.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nAmong the highlights:\n\n\u2014 On how to use the product: \u201cIt depends. Some people use it more than once a day; some people use it once a week. That\u2019s what\u2019s great about it. It\u2019s versatile and very user-friendly.\u201d\n\n\u2014 On how using the product makes Damon feel: \u201cRelaxed. Which is really the goal. At the end of a stressful day, you want to kick back and relax a bit.\u201d\n\n\u2014 On his wife\u2019s opinion of the product: \u201cWell, that\u2019s who I heard about it from. She called me \u2014 I was at work \u2014 and she said, \u2018Hey, this is a hell of a product.'\u201d", "images": ["https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/s3___bgmp-arc_arc-feeds_generic-photos_to-arc_tlumackibruins154-691e4036f08df-768x432.jpg?width=190", "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/damonkimmel-68e28082a0e75-150x150.jpg", "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/jetblue-6539608af2b47-768x432.jpeg?width=190", "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Jimmy_Kimmel_97318-691e411db94a6-768x432.jpg", "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/BDC_Logo_2020_256x256-60d0abc34135e.png", "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/northconway-691e22998b210-768x432.png?width=190", "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/s3___bgmp-arc_arc-feeds_generic-photos_to-arc_-tlumackisushi164-691d24fc17245-768x432.jpg?width=190", "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Matt-Damon-Ken-Jennings-Jimmy-Kimmel-Jeopardy-688b95044cdd3-150x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=989222871864976&ev=PageView&noscript=1&dpo=", "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/themes/bdc-2020/dist/images/bdc_30_annivesary_logo_site.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=813236348753005&ev=PageView&noscript=1&dpo=", "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/o-ya_CREDIT-BRIAN-SAMUELS-PHOTOGRAPHY_MAY-2018-0441-scaled-768x432.jpg?width=190"], "top_img": "https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/BDC_Logo_2020_256x256-60d0abc34135e.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kevin Slane", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.boston.com/culture/entertainment/2017/10/26/watch-matt-damon-sell-a-half-naked-jimmy-kimmel-blow-up-doll/", "title": "Watch Matt Damon sell a half-naked Jimmy Kimmel blow-up doll", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Watch Matt Damon sell a half-naked Jimmy Kimmel blow-up doll", "description": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mv8_OcYysU Matt Damon may say he\u2019s not a fan of Jimmy Kimmel, but thanks to a prank by Ellen DeGeneres, Damon briefly became the biggest fan of a plastic version of the late-night host.
