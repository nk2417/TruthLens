In one of our last conversations, he shared a startling story with me. In 2003, he said, he had been groped by a former president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association (HFPA), the organization responsible for putting on the Golden Globes. The incident, he said, was traumatic\u2014\"I felt ill. I felt like a little kid\"\u2014and the aftermath even more so: \"I felt like someone had thrown invisible paint on me.\"\n\nAfter the story was published, the HFPA issued a statement promising an investigation:\n\n\"The HFPA stands firmly against sexual harassment and the type of behavior described in this article. Over the years we've continued a positive working relationship with Brendan, which includes announcing Golden Globe nominees, attending the ceremony and participating in press conferences. This report includes alleged information that the HFPA was previously unaware of and at this time we are investigating further details surrounding the incident.\"\n\nRead More What Ever Happened To Brendan Fraser? The stupendous rise and surprising disappearance of Brendan Fraser.\n\nSince then, the HFPA has remained silent about what they did or did not determine, but according to Fraser, the organization's investigation has now concluded. In April, he says, an independent investigator contacted him and interviewed him about the incident, which took place at the Beverly Hills Hotel in the summer of 2003. There, as Fraser originally recounted to me, he was groped by former HFPA president Philip Berk: \"His left hand reaches around, grabs my ass cheek, and one of his fingers touches me in the taint. And he starts moving it around.\" (Berk denied this: \"Mr. Fraser's version is a total fabrication.\" Berk said he pinched Fraser in jest, in reference to a false gossip item he'd read about Fraser doing the same to someone else.)\n\nAfter the HFPA finished its investigation, according to Fraser, the organization contacted him again and proposed issuing a joint statement, which said, \"Although it was concluded that Mr. Berk inappropriately touched Mr. Fraser, the evidence supports that it was intended to be taken as a joke and not as a sexual advance.\" The organization also apologized to Fraser in the proposed statement and suggested a forward-looking resolution: \"All parties consider this matter to be concluded.\" The HFPA wrote that it looked forward \"to continuing to work with Mr. Fraser.\" And presumably Philip Berk would remain a member in good standing of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and a Golden Globe voter. Berk, in an e-mail, confirmed his ongoing status as an active voter in the HFPA. \"Yes, I certainly am,\" he said.", "images": ["https://media.gq.com/photos/68ffd9994aa5c9fcbf517fd5/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/691c04eaa13c7c0622bdb97f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/68f81cdec153240698147610/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/690d0b02886410c67636de0d/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6918c0d60f55439162cf675b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo.svg", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b15aeaf789de149f33ecf06/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/brendan-fraser-me-too-gq.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b16bd4d23090e307e3152d9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/brendan-fraser-philip-berk-gq.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/68f6d3e4114bd501a609530c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b16be3214e42f67f857d050/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/brendan-fraser-2003-gq.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/690838f46af983c8f3844271/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/asset-tentpole-moty.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6913a8ca2645a475d1fb33c9/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/691354fa6c60c39fba4888de/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b15aeaf789de149f33ecf06/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/brendan-fraser-me-too-gq.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/68fd39ca157ef4ab681f9e57/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a84b084c0fcdc28d27c7d78/1:1/w_775%2Cc_limit/Brendan-Fraser.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/69124d0c46b29950831b3c8b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/690ba46666de5cf12544bf63/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b15aeaf789de149f33ecf06/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/brendan-fraser-me-too-gq.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zach Baron"], "canonical_link": "https://www.gq.com/story/brendan-fraser-says-hfpa-denied-sexual-harassment-claims", "title": "UPDATED: Brendan Fraser Says the HFPA Denied His Claims of Sexual Harassment", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Zach Baron", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "According to Fraser, after finally investigating his 15-year-old claim, the HFPA tried to explain that Berk's actions were intended as \"a joke.\" But Fraser's not laughing.", "id": "5b170000133fe616d11668a6", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b170000133fe616d11668a6", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"According to Fraser, after finally investigating his 15-year-old claim, the HFPA tried to explain that Berk's actions were intended as \\\"a joke.\\\" But Fraser's not laughing.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/5b15aeaf789de149f33ecf06/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/brendan-fraser-me-too-gq.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/5b15aeaf789de149f33ecf06/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/brendan-fraser-me-too-gq.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "After an internal investigation, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association says the act was intended as \"a joke.\" But Fraser's not laughing.", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b15aeaf789de149f33ecf06/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/brendan-fraser-me-too-gq.jpg", "site_name": "GQ", "title": "UPDATED: Brendan Fraser Says the HFPA Denied His Claims of Sexual Harassment", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gq.com/story/brendan-fraser-says-hfpa-denied-sexual-harassment-claims"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-06-06T12:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-06-06T12:00:00.000Z", "author": "Zach Baron"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@gqmagazine", "description": "After an internal investigation, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association says the act was intended as \"a joke.\" But Fraser's not laughing.", "domain": "https://www.gq.com", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b15aeaf789de149f33ecf06/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/brendan-fraser-me-too-gq.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@gqmagazine", "title": "UPDATED: Brendan Fraser Says the HFPA Denied His Claims of Sexual Harassment"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5b15aeaf789de149f33ecf06/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/brendan-fraser-me-too-gq.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 606963029328755, "pages": 7962048097}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528286400.0, "source": "https://www.gq.com", "summary": ""}
