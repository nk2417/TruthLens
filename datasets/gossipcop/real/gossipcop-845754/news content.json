The actress, 47, has given fans a peek inside her meticulously-tidy bathroom cabinet, in an image posted on her Instagram account.\n\n\u2018My face and beauty essentials,\u2019 she wrote. \u2018And no, I don\u2019t use them all at the same time.\u2019\n\nThe neat rows of products, many in duplicate or triplicate, mirror the recent glimpse she gave followers of her obsessively-organised walk-in wardrobe, which contains clothes worth more than half a million dollars.\n\nCatherine Zeta-Jones has given fans a peek inside her meticulously-tidy bathroom cabinet, in an image posted on her Instagram account\n\nThe bathroom cabinet contains products worth more than $2,600, including cleanser made of Icelandic kelp and a $450 tub of face cream. Here we reveal the secrets lurking inside Catherine\u2019s beauty cupboard:\n\n1 Natura Bisse Diamond Extreme moisturizer, $355\n\nThis face cream contains extracts of artemia salina \u2013 a species of saltwater shrimp said to restore elasticity to the skin.\n\n2 Natura Bisse The Cure Sheer eye cream, $125\n\nSaid to firm the delicate skin around the eyes and \u2018erase any sign of tiredness\u2019. Despite the hefty price, the bottle contains only 15ml.\n\n3 Natura Bisse The Cure Sheer face cream, $190\n\nBlurs dark circles and softens fine lines around the eyes, countering the effects of pollution. Contains a skin-plumping compound, fermentus glaciarum. Fans include Beyonce and Elle Macpherson.\n\n4 Cygalle Healing Spa aromatherapy facial mist, $25\n\nInfused with jojoba oil, this spray was sold as part of a Valentine\u2019s Day set so may have been a gift from husband Michael Douglas, 72.\n\n5 Rhonda Allison Cucumber Spritz, $26\n\nDescribed as \u2018giving skin a drink of water\u2019, it is made from cucumber, coconut oil, witch hazel and honey. However, the spritz works best if kept in the fridge. Other Rhonda Allison fans include Sarah Jessica Parker and Mila Kunis.\n\n6 Rhonda Allison Moisture Eye-Zyme, $16\n\nTones and firms the upper and lower lids while minimising fine lines and erasing crepey tissue. It uses the acid produced when the exotic fruit ferments.\n\nThe actress is seen at the Lincoln Centre in New York on April 18\n\n7 Rhonda Allison SynErgy A, $125\n\nVitamin A-based serum which promises to rejuvenate the skin in 24 hours.\n\n8 Rhonda Allison Eye Lift, $69\n\nClaims to improve the appearance of wrinkles by helping the skin produce more collagen. Perfumed with lavender and sweet almond oil.\n\n9 Rhonda Allison Age Less Anti-Glycation Serum, $95\n\nClaims to prevent collagen cells being broken down by sugar \u2013 a boon for ageing skin \u2013 and to have anti-inflammatory qualities.\n\n10 Rhonda Allison Drop Of Essence Hydration Drops, $48\n\nShould probably be kept in Catherine\u2019s handbag, as it\u2019s designed to be applied throughout the day to stop dry skin from peeling.\n\n11 Lancome Bi-Facil cleanser, $30\n\nRemoves make-up, including waterproof mascara, without leaving an oily residue and is ideal for contact-lens wearers. Catherine often has to wear coloured contacts on-screen.\n\n12 Certain Dri Everyday Strength deodorant, $6.99\n\nFar stronger than a regular deodorant, this roll-on contains aluminium zirconium, which blocks pores under the arms and absorbs perspiration.\n\n13 Skyn Pure Cloud Hot Cloth Cleanser, $28\n\nDesigned to be applied in the evenings with a wet muslin cloth, it removes make-up.\n\n14 Skyn Brightening Eye Serum, $35\n\nMassaged in to \u2018depuff\u2019 eye bags and reduce crows\u2019 feet, it contains Arctic peptides, water from the North Atlantic, cranberries and cloudberries.\n\n15 Skyn The Antidote Cooling Daily Lotion, $45\n\nMade with Icelandic kelp, it claims to help reduce blotchy red skin and blemishes.\n\n16 Dior Capture Totale DreamSkin, $115\n\nWorks by laying a transparent \u2018veil\u2019 over the face, making it appear radiant and glowing, while erasing blotches and redness.\n\n17 Sarah Chapman Skinesis 3 Skin Tone Perfecting Booster, $75.50\n\nTargets age spots, sun damage and discoloration. Contains bearberry and a skin-brightening chemical from alpine plants.\n\n18 Cle de Peau Beaute energizing cream, $150\n\nFairly cheap in comparison to some of the brand\u2019s $700-plus range, this aims to lighten dark spots on the face and contains wrinkle-busting ingredients.\n\nThe actress, pictured in London on January 26, wrote on the post: \u2018My face and beauty essentials,\u2019 she wrote. \u2018And no, I don\u2019t use them all at the same time'\n\n19 Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream, $100\n\nAimed at women with \u2018hungover skin\u2019, it is designed to make you look like you\u2019ve had more sleep than you have. Contains wild pansy extract, rosehip oil and sodium hyaluronate, a salt found in human connective tissue\n\n20 Chanel Le Lift firming anti-wrinkle cream, $165\n\nClaims to \u2018adapt to the background of your skin\u2019, with different effects depending on users\u2019 lifestyle, emotions and environment.\n\n21 Assorted medical products, $31\n\nIncluding eye drops, herbal oils and face masks, this is more akin to the clutter found in the average bathroom cupboard \u2013 but Catherine has organised them on a blingy gold tray.\n\n22 Elemis Pro-Collagen Cleansing Balm, $64\n\nWarmed in the palms, it is then massaged over the face, neck and decollete one teaspoon at a time before being washed down the sink. Ingredients include the oils and essences of oranges, elderberries, starflowers, grapes, coconuts and geraniums, which are all \u2018supercharged\u2019 with an anti-ageing algae.\n\n23 Le Metier de Beaute Neck and Decollete Firming Creme, $450\n\nThis astonishingly expensive cream claims to smooth and tighten the delicate skin around the neck and collarbone. The formula is a closely-guarded secret.\n\n24 Revitalash Advanced eyelash conditioner, $74.99\n\nOften described as a \u2018wonder product\u2019 by fans, it is applied to dry lashes, before mascara is put on, to help them grow longer. Victoria Beckham is a fan.\n\n25 Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream Skin Protectant, $22\n\n\u2018There are certain products that don\u2019t age at all,\u2019 Catherine said in a recent interview. \u2018My mother [used to put] Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Cream Skin Protectant on me.\u2019\n\n26 Vanessa Megan Citrus and Spice Natural Cologne, $39.95\n\nA frugal choice \u2013 and a strangely masculine scent \u2013 it contains mandarin oil, which soothes nerves, relieves tension and diminishes anxiety.\n\n27 Sunday Riley Flora Hydroactive Cellular Face Oil, $90\n\nMade from Russian, Bulgarian and Turkish roses, plus rose geranium.\n\n28 Argan oil, $20\n\nProduced from the nuts of the Moroccan argan tree, she uses this at night to keep her skin looking dewy and fresh.\n\nAdditional reporting by Amy Kester", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/19/12/104005979-0-image-m-6_1763553771266.jpg",
