As Prince William\u2019s brother Prince Harry is expecting his first child with Meghan Markle, bookies have slashed the odds on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge expecting a baby as well. Bookies Coral have released odds over a sudden announcement from the future King and Queen of England as the odds now shows the chance of Kate being pregnant at 1/2 - a 50 percent chance.\n\nCoral's Harry Aitkenhead said: \"Our odds show that there's every chance that Kate and Wills might add to their growing family, and a fourth baby is certainly a possibility. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT \u201cWe've taken some bets over the last two weeks or so on it happening and there's a real buzz around the Royal family at the moment with Meghan expecting.\u201d But whether the Duchess of Cambridge will follow in the Queen\u2019s footstep by having four children is yet to be confirmed. One source has said he does not think Kate will have more children as he thinks \u201cKate is done\u201d after suffering extreme morning sickness throughout her three previous pregnancies.

Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT \u201cI should think that three children is enough.\" A source also told Express.co.uk the Duchess had to convince Prince William to have a third child, because she \"always wanted more than two children\". The source said: \u201dAs one of three, Kate wanted at least three.\n\nPrince William reveals Prince George loves dancing like Diana\n\nKate and Prince William at Prince Louis' christening\n\n\u201cWilliam was more reluctant, not just because he was one of two, but because George was quite a difficult baby. \"Then they had Charlotte and she was a lot easier. \u201cNow the idea of a newborn doesn\u2019t seem half as challenging.\" The royal couple is also thought to already have their hands full with taking care of Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
