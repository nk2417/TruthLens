She was first spotted at a Clippers vs. Lakers game on Oct. 19, and then again Nov. 3.\n\nThe couple have been hanging out since August \u2014 shortly after he split from the mother of his two children, Brynn Cameron, a former college basketball player.\n\nThey\u2019ve been frequently spotted together ever since, from getting into costume at a Halloween party to grabbing a bite at Sugarfish Sushi in Beverly Hills on Sunday.\n\nHe was also with Jenner and her family at her birthday dinner at Petit Taqueria earlier this month.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kendall Jenner Wears $10K Boots to Support Blake Griffin at Clippers Game\n\n\u201cKendall was in a great mood,\u201d an onlooker told PEOPLE of the supermodel at the event. \u201cShe and Blake hung out, but they also mingled separately.\u201d\n\nAnother source added: \u201cKendall is very happy with Blake. They started out more like friends, and then it was very casual. But it seems more serious lately. When they are not together, they keep in touch over the phone. Her family has accepted Blake. They are spending time getting to know him.\u201d", "images":
