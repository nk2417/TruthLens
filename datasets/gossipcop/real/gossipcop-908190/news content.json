ABC Signature Studios is in early development for a series based on the \u201990s franchise, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter. While no network is attached, original trilogy screenwriter Steven Brill and original producer Jordan Kerner reportedly approached ABC Signature head Tracy Underwood about creating the series.\n\nRelated: Costars Reunited Nothing like a little reunion! Stars from both TV and film are constantly reuniting in Hollywood, whether it be on a red carpet or for a new project. Check out stars -- from shows and movies like That '70s Show, Saved by the Bell and Full House -- that have come together years after they took their last bows together\n\nThe report goes on to say that the show will not be shopped around anytime soon and that the 1992 film\u2019s original stars Emilio Estevez (Gordon Bombay) and Joshua Jackson (Charlie Conway) are not attached \u2026 yet. However, that didn\u2019t stop fans from getting very excited about the news on Twitter.\n\nWhoa, a MIGHTY DUCKS TV series is in development\u2026that\u2019s my childhood right there. pic.twitter.com/RjpZbnooMn \u2014 Skyler Shuler (@Skylerhxc) January 22, 2018\n\nThe ONLY way a Mighty Ducks series will work is if you bring Josh Jackson in to be the coach. \u2014 \ud83d\udda4 Barbarella \ud83d\udda4 (@youthinkmemad) January 22, 2018\n\nMighty Ducks show is being developed for cable or streaming. So we may get a more explicit version of the Quack chant. \u2014 UntemperedTelevision (@UntemperedTV) January 22, 2018\n\nABC is making the Mighty Ducks TV series!!! \u2014 Ryan (@R36Coburn) January 22, 2018\n\nThe Mighty Ducks was a franchise made up of three films. The second film, D2: The Mighty Ducks, came out in 1994, followed by the third, D3, in 1996.\n\nMultiple members of the original cast got back together in September 2014 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the film. Mike Vitar (Luis Mendoza), Garrett Henson (Guy Germaine), Marguerite Moreau (Connie) Vincent Larusso (Adam Banks), Aaron Lohr (Dean Portman), Shaun Weiss (Greg Goldberg), Colombe Jacobsen-Derstine (Julie Gaffney) and Scott Whyte (Gunnar Stahl) all celebrated as a group, capturing it on Instagram.\n\nFlying V! #mightyducks reunion A post shared by Christopher Redman (@redcrumbs) on Sep 21, 2014 at 3:24pm PDT\n\nJackson did not attend the reunion but did reveal in an interview timed to the anniversary that he could see the movies being explored further. \u201cI feel like a fourth film should happen, and if there was space for any of the original kids to come back and have a role, I would be surprised that anybody didn\u2019t want to do it,\u201d The Affair star told Time magazine. \u201cThe next generation should have its own version. Not that we need to come back as adults, but I hope my kids grow up and play pickup hockey and I hope that they have their own movies like my generation had those movies. In that way, yeah, of course, I\u2019d be a part of something like that.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-instagram-r.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Mormon-Wives-Trailer-Shows-Jessi-Ngatikaura-Husband-Jordan-Ngatikaura-Threatening-Marciano-Brunette.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=600%2C600&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-whatsapp.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-twitter-r.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mighty-ducks-zoom.jpg?w=1000&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-tiktok-r.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-facebook-r.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3-black.png?w=600&h=338&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mighty-ducks-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C103px%2C1255px%2C659px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/a360media-logo-color.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2243107021-kessler-twins-died-by-assisted-suicide.jpg?w=600&h=600&crop=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/privacyoptions730x350.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SusanPowter.jpg?crop=344px%2C0px%2C1125px%2C1123px&resize=600%2C600&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Feature-Meghan-King-Ex-Jim-Edmonds-Awarded-Sole-Custody.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C2000px&resize=600%2C600&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/hair-by-chrissy-drama-explained.png?crop=0px%2C256px%2C1234px%2C1234px&resize=600%2C600&quality=86&strip=all", "https://sso.ami-admin.com/wp-content/uploads/us_footer_weekly.jpg?auto=compress&q=55&w=410&h=546&cachebuster=20251120", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/mixer.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-googlenews-r.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-google-c.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/storifyme/usw-shorts-module-banner-desktop-v1.png"], "top_img": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mighty-ducks-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C103px%2C1255px%2C659px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/mighty-ducks-tv-series-reportedly-in-the-works-twitter-reacts/", "title": "\u2018Mighty Ducks\u2019 TV Series Reportedly in the Works: Twitter Reacts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "ahrefs-site-verification": "0c593552a61f5d2f07d12f3629456cc24366510fb83bd76eb9504919faac5af7", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"updated_time": "2018-01-22T22:24:24+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mighty-ducks-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C103px%2C1255px%2C659px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mighty-ducks-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C103px%2C1255px%2C659px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Mighty Ducks\u2019 TV Series Reportedly in the Works: Twitter Reacts", "description": "The 1992 hockey flick may be coming to the silver screen!
