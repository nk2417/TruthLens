The song was a cover of Brandi Carlile\u2019s signature hit \u201cThe Story\u201d \u2014 as performed by Ramirez during \u201cSong Beneath the Song,\u201d the season seven musical episode of Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\n\nAnd while Ramirez\u2019s Callie was never seen onscreen, the character did have a prominent role. Arizona, newly single after breaking things off with Carina (Stefania Spampinato), decided to move back to New York so her daughter with Callie could have both of her parents in the same city. During Thursday\u2019s finale, Arizona revealed that Callie was single now as well. What\u2019s more, Arizona told April and Richard that she was having feelings again for Callie \u2014 with the latter seemingly of the same mindset.\n\nWhat did you think of Ramirez\u2019s cameo and how Arizona\u2019s storyline ended?
