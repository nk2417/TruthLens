{"url": "https://www.gq.com/story/megyn-kelly-bill-oreilly-the-receipts", "text": "Former Fox News talking head and current sad old creep Bill O'Reilly left the network earlier this year after an avalanche of sexual harassment allegations caused advertisers to flee his stupid show en masse. Over the weekend, the New York Times published a report revealing that O'Reilly had settled with an accuser for an astonishing $32 million shortly before the upstanding citizens at Fox News signed him to a $100 million contract extension in February\u2014a decision, one would presume, that it came to regret a few months later.\n\nO'Reilly, as usual, remains very, very mad about all of this. He continues to assert that no women complained about him during the entirety of his twenty-year tenure, and he punctuated his interview with the Times with things like \"This is horrible!\" and \"This is crap!\" and other normal things that well-balanced people say when they definitely didn't do the horrible things they've been accused of doing. On Monday, Megyn Kelly, a former O'Reilly colleague who left in January for NBC, went on the air to dispute his claims, reading from evidence obtained from a source she knows well: herself.", "images": ["https://media.gq.com/photos/6916928260d328606a06ec5f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6916aa75ea366cd8560f5749/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6917a602344e3b09451b19b3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e5236b6d413fa363728/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-862911956.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/691c9953db523f8efa81b00b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/67ffe2862295e291fb2f11c3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/67e2e7a7319c00fc4a9eb1f5/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/691b99d8ae69092d9a6ffaaf/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/66f58bface92479a317dfcd3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/68c88de476e8da9f4a84b640/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/asset-tentpole-moty.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/651b027b39a3e772eeea0a81/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/68f69dd0114bd501a60952fc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo-reverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jay Willis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.gq.com/story/megyn-kelly-bill-oreilly-the-receipts", "title": "Megyn Kelly Shares Her Complaints About Bill O'Reilly That Fox News Allegedly Ignored", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Jay Willis", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Megyn Kelly shared old complaints about Bill O'Reilly that she had sent to superiors at Fox News, who then allegedly ignored her.", "id": "59ee46a924789d7510df1e52", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59ee46a924789d7510df1e52", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Megyn Kelly shared old complaints about Bill O'Reilly that she had sent to superiors at Fox News, who then allegedly ignored her.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png\"}", "og": {"description": "She read from her old complaints about Bill O'Reilly on the air.", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png", "site_name": "GQ", "title": "Megyn Kelly Offers Rare Look Into How Fox News Silences Alleged Victims of Sexual Harassment", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gq.com/story/megyn-kelly-bill-oreilly-the-receipts"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-10-23T21:39:46.938Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-23T21:39:46.938Z", "author": "Jay Willis"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@gqmagazine", "description": "She read from her old complaints about Bill O'Reilly on the air.", "domain": "https://www.gq.com", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@gqmagazine", "title": "Megyn Kelly Offers Rare Look Into How Fox News Silences Alleged Victims of Sexual Harassment"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/59ee5e8724789d7510df1e8d/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-10-23%20at%202.25.15%20PM.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 606963029328755, "pages": 7962048097}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508794786.938, "source": "https://www.gq.com", "summary": ""}
