I have a great wonderful guy, Geno, and I feel like a kid again,\u201d Mama June, who dropped 300 lbs. from her onetime high of 460 lbs. in 2016, told audiences about her new beau. \u201cGeno knew me when I was heavy and I really think he\u2019s here for the right reasons. I think he likes me for me, not for [fame] or me being skinny.\u201d\n\nAlthough Mama June admitted to enjoying sneaking around with Geno \u2014 it\u2019s \u201ckind of hot, it\u2019s kind of like foreplay. I\u2019m kind of liking it, I\u2019m kind of digging it,\u201d she admitted \u2014 she was intentionally keeping it on the down low to protect her daughters from getting hurt.\n\n\u201cGeno\u2019s the first guy that I\u2019ve dated really serious since I\u2019ve lost the weight, and I\u2019m trying to keep this one to myself to see how it\u2019s going to work out,\u201d she explained. \u201cI hope this one works out, but honestly, I\u2019ve had some terrible luck with guys and I\u2019ve got really burnt. So, it\u2019s really hard for me to fully trust him right now.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, her family\u2019s TLC reality show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo was abruptly canceled after she was accused of dating a man who had been convicted of molesting her oldest daughter Anna, 23, an allegation she strenuously denied. Later, when she split from her on-again, off-again beau Matt \u201cSugar Bear\u201d Thompson, Alana\u2019s father, after a stint on Marriage Boot Camp in 2016, Mama June accused him of physical abuse. Thompson, who married Jennifer Lamb earlier this year, denies the allegations.\n\nCourtesy WE tv\n\nWatch the full episode of Mama June: How I Kept Off 300 lbs., streaming now onPeopleTV.

Weight Loss: Sleeping Until 1 to Skip Breakfast!\n\nBut did Alana approve of her mother\u2019s new boyfriend?\n\n\u201cI mean, he\u2019s a cool guy or whatever,\u201d Alana admitted. Still, she had her reservations about how the new romance would impact their own mother-daughter relationship. \u201cDoes that mean me and you ain\u2019t going to hang out no more \u2019cause you have a boyfriend?\u201d Alana asked. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been around a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, now that y\u2019all are getting older, it\u2019s time for me to find somebody that I can be happy with,\u201d Mama June said to her. \u201cI\u2019ve been single for so long and been devoted to y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nDuring a recent interview with PEOPLE, Mama June called Geno \u201cmy rock and my best friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been able to enjoy somebody as much as I have him,\u201d she shared.\n\nShe added: \u201cHe restored our faith when we thought there were no good men left out there.\u201d\n\nMama June: From Not to Hot airs Fridays (9 p.m. ET) on WE tv.", "images":
