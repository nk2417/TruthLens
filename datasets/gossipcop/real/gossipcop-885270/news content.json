Hill wanders down the road in her ruffled purple floor-length gown to find a shabby diner, where McGraw finds her and the couple have a daramatic reunion.\n\nThe Rest of Our Life was produced with Byron Gallimore and Dann Huff, and will be released by Sony Music Entertainment under the Arista Nashville/McGraw imprint. Find the full track list with writer credits below. The album is available for pre-order starting today with the title track available instantly with all digital pre-orders.\n\nThe Rest of Our Life Track List\n\n\u201cThe Rest of Our Life\u201d (Ed Sheeran/Amy Wadge/Johhny McDaid/Steve Mac)\n\n\u201cTelluride\u201d (Jon Randall/Jessi Alexander)\n\n\u201cThe Bed We Made\u201d (Lori McKenna/Liz Rose/Hillary Lindsey)\n\n\u201cCowboy Lullaby\u201d (Brett James/Brett Beavers)\n\n\u201cBreak First\u201d (Emily Weisband/Ashley Gorly/Jerry Flowers)\n\n\u201cLove Me to Lie (Hayley Warner/Maureen McDonald/Nathan Chapman)\n\n\u201cSleeping in the Stars\u201d (Jaida Dreyer/Mark Irwin/Gareth Dunlop)\n\n\u201cDamn Good at Holding On\u201d (Lori McKenna/Barry Dean)\n\n\u201dDevil Callin\u2019 Me Back\u201d (Jesse Frasure/Ben Caver/Nolan Sipe)\n\n\u201cSpeak to a Girl\u201d (Shy Carter/Dave Gibson/Joe Spargur)\n\n\u201cRoll the Dice\u201d (Shy Carter/Bobby Hammrick/James LeBlanc/Meghan Trainor)\n\nThe Rest of Our Life is set be released on Nov. 17.
