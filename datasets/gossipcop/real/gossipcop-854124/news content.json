Now, however, she is opening up to say, \u201cI was denied my on-camera happy ending\u201d and \u201clabeled an angry black female.\u201d\n\nLindsay was the first black lead of the long-running franchise, which just wrapped its 14th season of The Bachelorette on Monday night. Lindsay remains the only black star in the franchise\u2019s combined 26 seasons, and though her long overdue casting was praised and her season was initially celebrated for its diversity, the cycle ended up being criticized for race-baiting for drama.\n\nIn a blog post about Becca Kufrin\u2019s finale for Us Weekly, Lindsay details how her TV ending played out differently than the one that just aired. Kufrin accepted a proposal from her winner, Garrett Yrigoyen, who has emerged as a controversial pick given his past social media history of liking several memes espousing offensive rhetoric.\n\nLindsay, who remains happily engaged to Abasolo, says the pretaped portion of the latest finale gave Kufrin and Yrigoyen the \u201ctrue definition\u201d of a happy ending. After the proposal, the live aftershow saw the couple return to discuss their journey off-camera, including the Instagram scandal. But Lindsay says what she endured on the night of her finale was much worse.\n\n\u201cBecca did not sit on stage for three hours and watch the finale for the first time in front of a live audience,\u201d Lindsay wrote, recalling how her part of the live post-finale special, After the Final Rose, cut into the pretaped portion. \u201cBecca did not have to deal with someone telling her she would live a mediocre life. Becca did not have to deal with being baited with real-time questions about her emotions watching certain scenes. Nope, that was me.\u201d\n\nAs viewers will recall, much of Lindsay\u2019s finale centered around the departure of her runner-up, Peter Kraus, and she criticized the show for focusing more on the breakup than the proposal.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just be honest, Becca did not have the finale that I had,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere was no controversy and she was not put in a position to face any. She was protected and I was placed on display for three hours and labeled an angry black female. And there will always be that stigma attached to my finale because it has been said that when truth is blurred by misinformation, perception becomes reality and all is lost.\u201d\n\nLindsay summed up what was meant to be a finale recap by challenging ABC and show producers to do better.\n\n\u201cThe Bachelor franchise does believe in happy endings \u2014 some people get an on-camera happy ending, some people get on off-camera happy ending, and some people get both,\u201d she says. \u201cFor Becca, I truly hope she gets both. As for my happy ending, it was not demonstrated within the confines of your television screens, but I am living it every day in real life. So in regards to a future on-camera happy ending and whether or not I will get married on TV, I have no idea but they damn sure owe us one.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Lindsay said that a lot of her relationship with Abasolo was left on the cutting-room floor because their relationship was drama-free. Instead, much of the focus was on Lindsay sending Kraus home early over his hesitance about proposing. \u201cBryan was the person,\u201d she said of why she sent Kraus home. \u201cI\u2019m only in love with one person through that entire season. I wanted that proposal to be all about Bryan. I wanted him to be the focus.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s Bachelor, Arie Luyendyk Jr., also spoke out after his season wrapped to say that he felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d by how show producers edited his controversial finale, which resulted in Kufrin being named as the Bachelorette.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1a5dcf4a-bd27-45b5-9e4e-7ea7eabb33d9_1.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1a5dcf4a-bd27-45b5-9e4e-7ea7eabb33d9_1.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackie Strause", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/bachelorette-rachel-lindsay-criticizes-editing-her-finale-1132842/", "title": "Ex-Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay Criticizes Show Producers Over Finale Edit", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Rachel Lindsay, the 2017 historic star of ABC's 'The Bachelorette,' criticizes how the show producers edited her finale and says she was labeled &quot;an angry black female.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Jackie Strause", "tags": "The Bachelorette", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ex-Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay Criticizes Show Producers Over Finale Edit", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/bachelorette-rachel-lindsay-criticizes-editing-her-finale-1132842/", "description": "Rachel Lindsay, the 2017 historic star of ABC's 'The Bachelorette,' criticizes how the show producers edited her finale and says she was labeled \"an angry black female.\"", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1a5dcf4a-bd27-45b5-9e4e-7ea7eabb33d9_1.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "'Bachelorette' Star Rachel Lindsay Criticizes Editing of Her Finale"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-08-07T12:43:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-07T14:18:57+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rachel Lindsay, the 2017 historic star of ABC's 'The Bachelorette,' criticizes how the show producers edited her finale and says she was labeled \"an angry black female.\"", "site": "@thr", "creator": "@jackiedstrause", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ex-Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay Criticizes Show Producers Over Finale Edit", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1a5dcf4a-bd27-45b5-9e4e-7ea7eabb33d9_1.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533645804.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
