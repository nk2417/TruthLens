The initiative will raise money for victims of Sunday might\u2019s attack, which left at least 59 dead and over 500 injured.\n\n\u201cWe know today is a special day. And that\u2019s because of fans like you,\u201d the video starts. \u201cThis year though, we\u2019re doing things a little differently. We want to turn the attention to those who need it.\u201d\n\nIn the video, they asked for $3 donations in honor of Oct. 3 to reach their goal of $300,000. All proceeds will go to the National Compassion Fund, a program in the National Center for Victims of Crime. The organization previously collected and distributed funds to victims of the Pulse Nightclub shooting in Orlando, the Aurora shooting in Colorado, and Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cWe know fetch is never going to happen, but we can make this happen,\u201d Chabert says.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mean-girls.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mean-girls.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rebecca Rubin", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/film/news/mean-girls-reunion-gofundme-las-vegas-shooting-1202579533/", "title": "\u2018Mean Girls\u2019 Cast Members Set Up GoFundMe for Las Vegas Shooting Victims", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "On Oct. 3, \"Mean Girls\" cast members set up a GoFundMe for Las Vegas shooting victims.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Rebecca Rubin", "tags": "Amanda Seyfried, Las Vegas Shooting, Mean Girls", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Mean Girls\u2019 Cast Members Set Up GoFundMe for Las Vegas Shooting Victims", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/film/news/mean-girls-reunion-gofundme-las-vegas-shooting-1202579533/", "description": "On Oct. 3, \"Mean Girls\" cast members set up a GoFundMe for Las Vegas shooting victims.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mean-girls.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Mean Girls"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-03T19:40:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-03T22:57:43+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "On Oct. 3, \"Mean Girls\" cast members set up a GoFundMe for Las Vegas shooting victims.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@rebeccaarubin", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Mean Girls\u2019 Cast Members Set Up GoFundMe for Las Vegas Shooting Victims", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mean-girls.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507059610.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
