I\u2019m very much focused on my career. I\u2019m just 18 - just trying to navigate my life. And I\u2019m having fun. There are obviously boys that I can crush on and stuff. But I\u2019m very much single.\u201d\n\nView 9 Images The pair cuddle up at the Wonderland Summer Issue dinner last month (Image: Getty Images Europe)\n\nShe continued: \u201cI\u2019ve known Brooklyn for years, we\u2019ve been really close and as we\u2019ve gotten older - and I\u2019m newly out of a relationship, we\u2019re definitely like crushing on each other. But we\u2019re both very busy. He\u2019s great, though. He\u2019s a cutie, literally one of my best friends.\u201d\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nPresumably not coming across as completely convincing, Madison went on to insist that they're only pals and that it would be difficult to date in any case because he's moving to New York soon.\n\nView 9 Images The 18-year-old gave a thumbs up (Image: Splash News)\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seriously best friends. We hang out every day with our whole group of friends in LA together,\u201d she added.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\u201cPeople are like, \u2018Oh no, you guys are definitely dating.\u2019 But he\u2019s moving to New York in two weeks - it\u2019s not really realistic... We\u2019re just having fun right now.\u201d\n\n9 View 9 Images Brooklyn held the door open for Madison as they left the store (Image: Splash News) 9 View 9 Images The pair were spotted leaving
