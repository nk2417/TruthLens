Pop singer Ariana Grande and Saturday Night Live cast member Pete Davidson called off their engagement over the weekend, leaving many, many people wondering who will get custody of their pet pig, what they will do about their matching tattoos, and, most pressingly, what will become of the $93,000 pear-shaped diamond ring that Davidson bought for Grande.\n\nPeople on Twitter were fixated specifically on the question of whether Davidson would be able to get the ring back, since it cost so very much. They didn\u2019t have to waste away in limbo for long: TMZ reported in the wee hours of Tuesday morning that Grande had already returned it. But, clearly, this situation was about a lot more than a diamond ring.\n\nWho?\n\nFamous people get together and break up all the time, so it\u2019s important to know that this isn\u2019t just any celebrity romance. Grande and Davidson\u2019s relationship captivated onlookers because of its speed, intensity, and incredibly public nature. It was also surprising, since Grande is, well, much more famous than Davidson.\n\nThey got together in late May, shortly after breaking up with partners they dated for multiple years \u2014 the rapper Mac Miller and Cazzie David, Larry David\u2019s daughter, respectively \u2014 and fanned the flames of the public\u2019s interest by flirting via Instagram comments. They got numerous tattoos for one another. After roughly one month of dating, they were engaged.\n\nThe usual rites of courtship happened at warp speed, magnified by Grande and Davidson\u2019s visibility and collective wealth. They adopted a pig and named it Piggy Smalls. They moved into a $16 million apartment in New York together. Grande titled the penultimate song on her album Sweetener \u201cpete davidson\u201d \u2014 not something most people do in a relationship, but notable nonetheless.\n\nIt all seemed so unwise! So soon! But also ... so fun, a spectacle played out on social media, where anyone with an Instagram account could follow their declarations of love. Davidson confirmed the engagement to Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s fucking lit, Jimmy.\u201d At the time, it kind of was.\n\nWhen Davidson and Grande broke up this weekend, it might not have been a huge surprise, but Twitter nonetheless went into overdrive. Of course it did: Fans were here for the romance, and they\u2019re here for the breakup. But beyond the emotional difficulties at hand, the question people really wanted answered was, who gets to keep that ridiculously expensive ring?\n\nSo who gets to keep that ridiculously expensive ring?\n\nBut it is telling that we\u2019re so obsessed with the question. For most of us, the $93,000 ring, crafted by Manhattan-based jeweler Greg Yuna, seems like a massive financial investment \u2014 an exorbitant purchase that echoes the all-in nature of Grande and Davidson\u2019s early relationship. The fate of that ring is just one more piece of this unbelievable romance. (Yuna\u2019s business has not responded to request for comment about whether it accepts returns on engagement rings.)\n\nThere\u2019s something else happening here, though. A lot of people on Twitter have expressed joking concern over Davidson\u2019s finances, saying that he\u2019s going to want the ring back so that he can pay his bills again.\n\nTo be clear: None of us know what\u2019s up with Davidson\u2019s finances. He probably makes a good salary on SNL, but that\u2019s about as much as you can say! It seems like these comments have less to do with Davidson\u2019s income and more with Davidson\u2019s income in relation to Grande\u2019s.\n\nGrande is massively successful \u2014 her albums, much like her hair, are certified platinum \u2014 and she definitely makes more than Davidson does. Their income disparity flips on its head the societal norm that says men in heterosexual relationships should be the breadwinners. Suggesting that Davidson is broke stretches those stereotypes even further: If a man isn\u2019t making as much as his female partner, he must be a complete failure. He must be financially reliant.\n\nThere was a real power imbalance in Davidson and Grande\u2019s relationship, and that was one of the reasons people followed it so avidly. (The desire to understand what each party was bringing to the table is also related to the advent of the phrase \u201cBig Dick Energy.\u201d) Grande was a world-famous pop star; Davidson was a sketch comedian who hadn\u2019t yet crossed over into mainstream Hollywood in the way that SNL alums like Will Ferrell or Amy Poehler have. In a way, Grande was Davidson\u2019s big break, and on the late-night talk show circuit, he wasn\u2019t shy about the differences in their career status.\n\n\u201cWe got a pig. Yo, can I just say, this girl, she was like, \u2018I want a pig!\u2019 And then an hour later, it was just there,\u201d Davidson said on Late Night With Seth Meyers in September. \u201cYou know what I mean? I\u2019m still trying to get a Propecia refill ... this girl got a pig in an hour.\u201d\n\nAnd in a GQ interview published in August, Davidson expressed a certain hesitance to call their apartment his own:\n\nDavidson and Grande recently moved into a Manhattan apartment that reportedly cost $16 million. She bought the place, Davidson says, and he stocks the fridge. \u201cShe\u2019s really sweet. She\u2019s like, \u2018This is our house,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018You\u2019re very nice for saying that. Thank you for letting me stay here,\u2019 \u201c he deadpans. \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018We\u2019re getting married!\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018I know, thank you for letting me stay here.\u2019 \u201c\n\nOn Monday, someone started a GoFundMe to give Davidson money for housing, though the page was removed that day.\n\nOf course, when people express faux concern over Davidson\u2019s finances, they might also be assuming that since Grande and Davidson rushed into a romantic relationship, one or both of them might also make rash financial decisions that they can\u2019t actually fund. Onlookers might be conflating Davidson\u2019s mental health challenges, which he\u2019s been open about, with an inability to manage money.", "images": ["https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-2239260660.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.02498750624688%2C100%2C99.950024987506&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/Vox_PeteGamlen_AI.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0.0078125%2C0%2C99.984375%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-687485318.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-687485318.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-2239260660.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.65%2C0%2C66.7%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13272747/GettyImages_1020376134.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C2.1759923481588%2C100%2C95.648015303682&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-1229647957.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.627751834556%2C0%2C66.744496330887%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13272747/GettyImages_1020376134.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C12.441878807455%2C100%2C75.116242385091&w=1200", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/author_profile_images/191013/Screen_Shot_2018-01-22_at_1.53.45_PM.0.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=96", "https://www.google-analytics.com/g/collect?v=2&tid=G-C3QZPB4GVE&cid=555&en=noscript_page_view", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-1229647957.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.058304181242711%2C100%2C99.883391637515&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/gettyimages-2208184612.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/Vox_PeteGamlen_AI.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.671875%2C0%2C66.65625%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-2244643855.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-2244643855.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/gettyimages-2208184612.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400"], "top_img": "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13272747/GettyImages_1020376134.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C12.441878807455%2C100%2C75.116242385091&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eliza Brooke"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/15/17978152/ariana-grande-pete-davidson-split-engagement-ring", "title": "Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande split: what happens to the ring?", "meta_data": {"bingbot": "nocache", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@voxdotcom", "url": "https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/15/17978152/ariana-grande-pete-davidson-split-engagement-ring", "title": "Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande broke up.
