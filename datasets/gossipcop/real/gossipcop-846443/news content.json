She started to cry a few times during the section, likely to get the most traction from the sit-down, in which she talks about the robbery and its aftermath. Kardashian West explained to a sympathetic DeGeneres that she is a \u201ccompletely different person\u201d following the harrowing incident.\n\n\u201cI know it sounds crazy, but I know that was meant to happen to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI don't want to start crying, but I know it was meant to happen. I feel like I'm such a different person. . . . I really feel like things happen in your life to teach you things. I was definitely materialistic before\u2014not that there's anything bad with having things and working hard to get those things, I'm really proud of everyone around me that's successful\u2014but I'm so happy that my kids get this me, that this is who I am raising my kids.\u201d\n\nKardashian West also said she does not feel the same need to show her possessions and jewelry on social media. \u201cI just don't care about that stuff anymore. I really don't. I'm not here to show off the way that I used to. It's just not who I am anymore.\u201d She told DeGeneres that she now understands that the thieves had been tracking her for two years, as they were monitoring and aware of her acquisitions and range of possessions, in part due to her social-media posts.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691e0cf07b19c6ee43dfcdba/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined",
