Here\u2019s to at least 13 more episodes of sharp jokes, loving friendship, and maybe one more Halloween heist directed by devoted fan and Oscar-winner Del Toro (hey, a girl can dream).", "images": ["https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AlexAbad-Santos_Vox.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-590696434.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/the-true-meaning-of-friendsgiving.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10827015/b99_cast.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C3.4613147178592%2C100%2C93.077370564282&w=1200", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-2155209999.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0.0041883062489489%2C0%2C99.991623387502%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-2155209999.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.669458870833%2C0%2C66.661082258335%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/author_profile_images/11181/Photo_on_11-5-15_at_12.21_PM.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=96", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-2217689678.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.024402147388969%2C100%2C99.951195705222&w=2400", "https://www.google-analytics.com/g/collect?v=2&tid=G-C3QZPB4GVE&cid=555&en=noscript_page_view", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AlexAbad-Santos_Vox.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-590696434.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/3_Vox_FuturePerfect25_LandingPage.gif?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-2217689678.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.650390625%2C0%2C66.69921875%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/the-true-meaning-of-friendsgiving.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=21.875%2C0%2C56.25%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/3_Vox_FuturePerfect25_LandingPage.gif?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10827015/b99_cast.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&w=2400"], "top_img": "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10827015/b99_cast.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C3.4613147178592%2C100%2C93.077370564282&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caroline Framke"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/5/12/17347612/brooklyn-nine-nine-99-canceled-cancelled-nbc-revived-season-6", "title": "NBC has saved Brooklyn Nine-Nine a day after Fox canceled it", "meta_data": {"bingbot": "nocache", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@voxdotcom", "url": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/5/12/17347612/brooklyn-nine-nine-99-canceled-cancelled-nbc-revived-season-6", "title": "NBC has saved Brooklyn Nine-Nine a day after Fox canceled it", "description": "It\u2019s official: The beloved comedy will have a new home for season 6.
