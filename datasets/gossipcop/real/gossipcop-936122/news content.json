The reclusive former TV lighting director was caught up in controversy after allegedly being caught staging photographs with the paparazzi. He reportedly pulled out of attending the ceremony in St George's Chapel on May 19 to avoid embarrassing his daughter. But he then later said before his surgery that he wanted to be part of history and hoped to be there, celebrity website TMZ revealed.
