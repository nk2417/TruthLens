He shows up later in the episode in his adult version (Andrew J. West) on a motorcycle, where he collides with Cinderella (Dania Ramirez).\n\nKitsis pointed out that the show would introduce a new version of Alice in Wonderland, who will be different from the one that fans met in the short-lived spinoff \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Wonderland.\u201d\n\nColin O\u2019Donoghue (Hook) said that the new season has a very different feel on set for the cast.\n\n\u201cIt almost feels like we\u2019re all starting the show afresh together,\u201d the actor said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like we\u2019re starting over.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce Upon a Time\u201d returns to ABC on Friday, Oct. 6.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5x4_082025_COVER.jpg?fit=240%2C300&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Once-Upon-a-Time.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Once-Upon-a-Time.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Gajewski", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid", "Border-Radius Box-Shadow Rgba", "Rgba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/once-upon-time-season-7-premiere-cast-exits/", "title": "\u2018Once Upon a Time\u2019: Creators Defend Cast Shakeup Amidst Fan Outcry", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Once Upon a Time': Creators Defend Cast Shakeup Amidst Fan Outcry", "description": "Comic-Con: Fan outburst led the moderator to scold, \"What it's not going to be is stuff like that\"", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/once-upon-time-season-7-premiere-cast-exits/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Once-Upon-a-Time.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-22T18:56:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-22T19:17:53+00:00"}, "author": "Ryan Gajewski", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Ryan Gajewski", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "abc, comic-con-2017, eddy-kitsis, once_upon_a_time", "article-section": "news", "article-categories": "news, report-comic-con, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500749800.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
