Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.\n\nAt such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.\n\nThe Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/03/09/the-dark-tower.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/03/09/the-dark-tower.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/the-dark-tower-teaser-trailer-release-date-idris-elba-matthew-mcconaughey-a7714546.html", "title": "The Dark Tower trailer: It's Idris Elba vs Matthew McConaughey", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/films/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "An adaptation of Stephen King's beloved fantasy series, the film sees Idris Elba as The Gunslinger and Matthew McConaughey as The Man in Black", "og": {"updated_time": "2017-05-03T08:25:21.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "The first trailer for The Dark Tower is here", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/news/the-dark-tower-teaser-trailer-release-date-idris-elba-matthew-mcconaughey-a7714546.html", "type": "article", "description": "An adaptation of Stephen King's beloved fantasy series, the film sees Idris Elba as The Gunslinger and Matthew McConaughey as The Man in Black", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/03/09/the-dark-tower.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/03/09/the-dark-tower.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-03T08:25:21.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-05-03T08:25:21.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Film", "author_name": "Clarisse Loughrey", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 318, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 3, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 1, "external_link_count": 2}, "date": "2017-05-03T08:25:21.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176832122"}, "twitter": {"title": "The first trailer for The Dark Tower is here", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "An adaptation of Stephen King's beloved fantasy series, the film sees Idris Elba as The Gunslinger and Matthew McConaughey as The Man in Black", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/03/09/the-dark-tower.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Dark Tower\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493799921.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
