But also, someone in our office said that someone from her, like, representative called and pitched her and he was pretty sure they thought it was a reality show. And I thought, well, \u2018How is that possible?\u2019\n\nShe continued, \u201cIf they think it\u2019s a reality show, why am I wearing a red wig and calling myself Valerie Cherish? And why would I be on a reality show called \u2018The Comeback?\u2019 That\u2019s the whole humiliating joke. Why would I do that?\u201d\n\nThe series featured a red-headed Kudrow as a has-been sitcom star vying for another shot at fame. And while a third season has yet to be confirmed, there have been discussions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking anyway, talking about what that would look like,\u201d Kudrow told E! News in 2015.\n\nThe first 13-episode season of \u201cThe Comeback\u201d ran from June to September 2005. An additional eight episodes aired nine years later in late 2014.", "images": ["https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fblomingdales.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115847739.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115919105.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2FFF-WP.png?w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115916411.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115918976.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115875312.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/lindsay-lohan-valerie-cherish.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115879604.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115838388.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/paige2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115901196.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115919105.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Felemis-black-friday.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1763642967&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115883447.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115905155.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115918976.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115874796.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115918332.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115905155.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115901196.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/lindsay-lohan-valerie-cherish.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/02/01/lisa-kudrow-lohans-team-thought-the-comeback-was-a-reality-show/", "title": "Lisa Kudrow: Lohan\u2019s team thought \u2018The Comeback\u2019 was a reality show", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
