{"url": "https://people.com/music/enrique-iglesias-anna-kournikova-inside-private-relationship/", "text": "While celebrity appearances in music videos are not uncommon, they don't typically result in a long-lasting romance like that of Latin pop star Enrique Iglesias and former professional tennis player Anna Kournikova.\n\nThe pair met in 2001 on the set of the singer's \"Escape\" music video, where they engaged in a few steamy makeout scenes. Their chemistry translated well off-screen and they became an official couple shortly after. They have since welcomed three children together, but have never married.\n\nIglesias and Kournikova have kept their two-decade-long relationship out of the spotlight for the most part, but on occasion, they will share rare glimpses into their family life on social media.\n\nFrom starring in the \"Escape\" music video together to raising three children, here's a complete timeline of Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova's relationship.\n\nDecember 2001: Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova meet on the set of a music video\n\nCarmen Valdes/Ron Galella Collection via Getty\n\nThe pair teamed up for Iglesias' 2001 music video \"Escape,\" which would help seal the deal on their love. The video, which features Kournikova playing coy against advances from Iglesias before ending in a makeout session, was the first time fans caught a glimpse of their chemistry.\n\nAugust 2002: Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova make their red carpet debut\n\nJim Spellman/WireImage\n\nIglesias and Kournikova walked the red carpet together for the first time at the MTV Video Music Awards in August 2002, where Iglesias was nominated for five awards, including best music video. The following year, the couple were seen at the Once Upon A Time In Mexico premiere in New York City.\n\nAugust 2004: Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova spark engagement rumors\n\nJason Squires/WireImage\n\nAfter Kournikova was spotted wearing a large pink diamond ring at a 2004 World Tennis Match, rumors quickly circulated that the pair were engaged. Shortly after, another rumor surfaced that Iglesias and Kournikova had secretly wed in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, but PEOPLE reported at the time that the rumors were false.\n\nMay 2007: Enrique Iglesias says he is \"single,\" but a source tells PEOPLE he is joking\n\nIglesias led fans to think that he and Kournikova had split when he told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet, \"We're divorced. I am single now, but that's okay I don't mind being alone.\"\n\nA source close to the couple told PEOPLE he was only joking and assured fans that \"they are still together.\"\n\nThe month prior, Iglesias told PEOPLE en Espa\u00f1ol that his romance with Kournikova was \"the only serious relationship I've had in my life.\" When asked if he could picture a future with the tennis star, he responded, \"I don't know. The only thing I can say is that, in my opinion, Anna, whether we are together or not, would be an ideal mother.\"\n\nApril 15, 2008: Anna Kournikova says she has no plans to marry Enrique Iglesias\n\nThe couple were still going strong in 2008 after more than five years together, however, they had no plans to marry.\n\nWhen asked if she would wed the \"Hero\" singer, Kournikova told PEOPLE, \"I'm never getting married,\" before giving a relationship update, saying, \"Everything is good.\"\n\nIglesias confirmed her reluctance to tie the knot days later when he told reporters that he'd been trying to convince Kournikova to marry him for years. \"I always try but she pays me no attention,\" he said.\n\nNovember 11, 2011: Anna Kournikova talks about her desire to have children with Enrique Iglesias\n\nBill Davila/FilmMagic\n\nIn an interview with Women's Health, Kournikova opened up about wanting to become a mother. \"I absolutely want to have children, whether I have my own or adopt,\" she said, \"I love taking care of people.\"\n\nShe also discussed why marriage was not part of her and Iglesias' plans for their future. \"[Marriage] isn't important to me. I'm in a happy relationship \u2014 that's all that matters,\" she told the outlet. \"I believe in commitment. I believe in being open and trusting each other and respecting each other completely.\"\n\nMarch 3, 2012: Enrique Iglesias explains why he and Anna Kournikova are not getting married\n\nIn an interview with Parade magazine, Iglesias also spoke about why marriage was not a high priority for the couple. \"I've never really thought marriage would make a difference,\" he explained. \"Maybe it's because I come from divorced parents, but I don't think you love somebody more because of a piece of paper. Nowadays, it's not taboo to have kids and not be married. What makes a difference is that you're a good parent, period.\"\n\nJune 9, 2016: Anna Kournikova shares a rare photo of her and Enrique Iglesias\n\nAnna Kournikova Instagram\n\nThe ultra-private couple don't post photos together on social media often, but Iglesias made a rare appearance on Kournikova's Instagram on her little brother's birthday.

In the sweet video, Nicholas was wearing a giant straw hat and could be heard saying \"wawa\" as he pointed at the water.\n\nJanuary 30, 2020: Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova welcome their third child\n\nAnna Kournikova Instagram\n\nIn early 2020, Kournivoka and Iglesias welcomed their third child, a daughter named Mary.

Like, 'Oh, really?' \"\n\nHe continued, \"Whenever they hear one of my songs they can actually recognize my voice, which is pretty cool. But when they watch that video, I think it does throw them off a little bit. 'What is Mom doing there?' you know, 'with Dad' you know? 'When was this?' \"\n\n\"It's actually incredible to watch the expression on their faces. It's pretty cool,\" he added.\n\nMay 8, 2022: Enrique Iglesias and Anna Kournikova celebrate Mother's Day and his birthday\n\nAnna Kournikova Instagram\n\nIn honor of Igesias' 47th birthday, Kournikova posted a rare photo of their whole family with the caption, \"Happy Birthday to the most amazing Dad!
