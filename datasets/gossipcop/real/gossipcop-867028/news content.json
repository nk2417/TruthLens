My name is Clover Ash Porter,\u201d Porter captioned a photo of his newborn girl. \u201cI\u2019m 9.3 lbs, 20\u00bd Inches, and have a 37.5 CM Head.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter a long journey and a slight 32-Hour detour through Neonatal ICU for my lungs I\u2019m finally with my Mommy and Daddy,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you all!!!!\u201d\n\nThe Friday Night Lights alum and Kelsey \u2013 whom Porter wed in April 2013 \u2013 are also parents to son McCoy Lee, 2. They announced their second pregnancy on Instagram in April, teasing their \u201cgrowing family.\u201d\n\nIn July, Porter revealed that their new addition would be a little girl through a sweet photo on social media that featured a University of Texas at Austin mini cheerleader\u2019s uniform hung alongside a similar University of Nebraska \u2013 Lincoln dress.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

They tested all our embryos for Huntington\u2019s and [McCoy] was the first little baby who made it all the way.\u201d", "images":
