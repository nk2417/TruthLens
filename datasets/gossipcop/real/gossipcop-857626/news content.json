I was like, 'Honey, give it a minute.'\"\n\nLuckily, Flynn's dreams of being a big brother have come true, as Kerr is currently pregnant. She and the Snapchat CEO announced they were expecting a child together in November 2017.\n\n\"[Flynn]'s very excited,\" she revealed to host Jimmy Kimmel. \"He has a mischievous personality like me. He also has my little chin.\"\n\nKerr, 34, and Spiegel, 27, who first met at a Louis Vuitton dinner in 2014, previously revealed that they were waiting until marriage to have children. The couple said \"I do\" in an intimate ceremony in Los Angeles, calling the day \"so joyful.\"\n\nHear more in the video below!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-07/1280_evan_spiegel_miranda_kerr_vogue.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2016-07/miranda_evan_1280_510334888.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/1280_miranda_kerr_getty902416590.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-11/gettyimages-622928998.jpg?h=71a4d20f&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/1280_miranda_kerr_getty902416590.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2019-12/celebkids_eod.png?h=dc0df84a&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/1280_miranda_kerr_getty902416590.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/pregnant-miranda-kerr-says-son-flynn-asked-if-she-was-expecting-one-day-after-her-wedding-95960", "title": "Pregnant Miranda Kerr Says Son Flynn Asked If She Was Expecting One Day After Her Wedding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/1280_miranda_kerr_getty902416590.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The model says the 7-year-old child she shares with Orlando Bloom is 'very excited' about becoming a big brother.", "title": "Pregnant Miranda Kerr Says Son Flynn Asked If She Was Expecting One Day After Her Wedding", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/pregnant-miranda-kerr-says-son-flynn-asked-if-she-was-expecting-one-day-after-her-wedding-95960", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The model says the 7-year-old child she shares with Orlando Bloom is 'very excited' about becoming a big brother.", "twitter": {"description": "The model says the 7-year-old child she shares with Orlando Bloom is 'very excited' about becoming a big brother.", "title": "Pregnant Miranda Kerr Says Son Flynn Asked If She Was Expecting One Day After Her Wedding", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/pregnant-miranda-kerr-says-son-flynn-asked-if-she-was-expecting-one-day-after-her-wedding-95960", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/1280_miranda_kerr_getty902416590.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Pregnant Miranda Kerr Says Son Flynn Asked If She Was Expecting One Day After Her Wedding | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Miranda Kerr, Orlando Bloom, Babies & Kids", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
