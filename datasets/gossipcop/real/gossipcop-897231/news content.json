The New York Times and the New Yorker first published investigative pieces in 2017 that accused disgruntled movie producer Harvey Weinstein of decades of sexual assault and harassment. Soon after, Weinstein stood trial and was [\u2026]\n\n\u201cIt was hard watching you all yesterday,\u201d Bush Hager said to Today host Hoda Kotb. \u201cWhen I started here, I remember someone saying, \u2018NBC, the Today show, is a family.\u2019 And that feels clich\u00e9. That feels like something people just say. But that\u2019s true. So, when something rocks your family, it rocks all of us.\u201d\n\n\"When something rocks your family, it rocks all of us.\" @JennaBushHager on Matt Lauer's dismissal from NBC News. pic.twitter.com/joWL9P9ocv \u2014 Kathie Lee and Hoda (@klgandhoda) November 30, 2017\n\nAs previously reported, Lauer\u2019s former cohosts Savannah Guthrie and Kotb broke the news of Lauer\u2019s termination, and allegations made against him by a colleague, during the opening of the Today show on Wednesday, November 29. Since then, Variety and The New York Times have reported multiple other claims against the former NBC anchor.\n\nRelated: Today Show\u2019s Biggest and Most Memorable Moments From Katie Couric's colonoscopy to Matt Lauer's infamous Tom Cruise interview to Ann Curry's tearful last day, here's a look at the biggest, buzziest, and most memorable moments in TODAY show history\n\n\u201cAnd that includes a man who was a mentor to many of us,\u201d the 36-year-old news correspondent continued, getting visibly emotional. \u201cAnd the women who are here, too, who are part of that same family, who have come forward and want to feel listened to and feel safe and respected \u2014 and they should, and they do. It was hard not to be here yesterday. It\u2019s hard to be here today. I know many of you feel that same way because you\u2019ve woken up with this family. I watched this show before I was on it.\u201d\n\nBush Hager added, \u201cAnd I pray, and I know you do too, for mercy for everybody that\u2019s involved in this.\u201d\n\nLauer spoke out about the claims and apologized in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,\u201d Lauer said in a statement to Us Weekly. \u201cTo the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC. Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly.\u201d\n\nRelated: Matt Lauer Fired by NBC News: Stars React After NBC News announced on Wednesday, November 29, that Matt Lauer had been fired overnight for \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace,\u201d several celebrities took to social media to react. In response to the news, President Donald Trump attacked the network once again for its coverage of his administration. \u201cWow, Matt Lauer was just fired [\u2026]\n\n\u201cRepairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul searching and I\u2019m committed to beginning that effort. It is now my full time job,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe last two days have forced me to take a very hard look at my own troubling flaws. It\u2019s been humbling. I am blessed to be surrounded by the people I love. I thank them for their patience and grace.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
