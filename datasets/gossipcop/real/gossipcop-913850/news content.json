The image of Jenner's first born has racked up more than 14.1 million \"likes\" as of Wednesday afternoon. Trailing close behind is Beyonce\u0301's 2017 post in which she revealed she was pregnant with twins. The photo has been \"liked\" more than 11.2 million times. A family photo shared by soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo last year has amassed more than 11.3 million \"likes.\"\n\nJenner's rep, Carrie Gordon, confirmed the baby's name to USA TODAY. .\n\nStormi's cousins are North, Saint and Chicago from Aunt Kim, and Dream from Uncle Rob. Aunt Kourtney provided playmates with relatively tame names by comparison: Mason, Penelope and Reign.\n\nCan't get enough of the Kardashian-Jenners?
