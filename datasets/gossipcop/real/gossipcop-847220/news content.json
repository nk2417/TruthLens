The stars of HGTV's Flip or Flop, who called it quits in late 2016 after seven years of marriage, were all smiles when they attended the Daytime Emmys together on Sunday. Christina, who recently showed off her amazing bikini body during a getaway to Hawaii in April, happily posed for photos with her ex on the red carpet at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in California.\n\nDespite their split, Tarek and Christina, who share daughter Taylor, 6, and son Brayden, 20 months, continue to work together. \"We'll be together for the rest of our lives because we have kids,\" Tarek told Us Weekly in March. \"We need to get along for the kids and for our sanity.\" Christina also told ET in March that they are \"actually getting along really, really well right now\" and \"letting go of past resentment, living in the future and remembering that kids are the priority.\" Their hit show was also recently picked up for an eighth season.", "images": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/7s9lHSbszObU8LZqsv4HXlD89es=/fit-in/792x940/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2017/05/01/594/n/1922398/e2b72a3d59073511a45d21.53876355_edit_img_cover_file_16360412_1493644324.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/24kT3ik67XMgUGxzFlvC1bHurqA=/fit-in/792x1188/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2017/05/01/594/n/1922398/173bcf6653d7ee19_GettyImages-675291714.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/6nVNpJD4EEKWtJ5Nw7AP5-rayG0=/fit-in/792x529/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2017/05/01/594/n/1922398/91eb92ad70b34cb9_GettyImages-675339594.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/GXArpIAvsWomt5GmjubUgZFnWzc=/fit-in/792x1187/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2017/05/01/594/n/1922398/02b554d60ee7510b_GettyImages-675294546.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/xYHX580L9KYOOCKM75tshRT_2rQ=/fit-in/792x940/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2017/05/01/594/n/1922398/ecb4b51c60ad3acb_GettyImages-675270962.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/ALQ5ATvXhLaVAPYz0PjpijZXk4s=/fit-in/792x515/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2017/05/01/594/n/1922398/671e53253fd4c68f_GettyImages-675339522.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/e6F3ZqkQ8acYpuA3drUHoEG4VAE=/fit-in/792x1029/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2017/05/01/594/n/1922398/29a59ed3e94ba0cd_GettyImages-675271090.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/gCHrQA5G30jr94IhKrJWI9Cg4-M=/fit-in/4213x2201/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2017/05/01/594/n/1922398/ca3d256e590735140f5153.63989660_edit_img_facebook_post_image_file_16360412_1493644324.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/gCHrQA5G30jr94IhKrJWI9Cg4-M=/fit-in/4213x2201/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2017/05/01/594/n/1922398/ca3d256e590735140f5153.63989660_edit_img_facebook_post_image_file_16360412_1493644324.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caitlin Gallagher", "Updated On May", "At Pm"], "canonical_link": "https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/tarek-christina-el-moussa-daytime-emmy-awards-2017-43486073", "title": "Flip or Flop's Tarek and Christina El Moussa Hit the Red Carpet Together After Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "keywords": "popsugar, caitlin gallagher, celebrity, celebrity breakups, red carpet, celebrity couples, tarek el moussa, flip or flop, christina anstead", "robots": "max-image-preview:large, follow, index", "bingbot": "nocache", "google-site-verification": "-ULnbgnS51gqvbNlz7JAhFDpYe74n2hhzpfc4KXeONA", "description": "PS makes wellness more accessible through real-life stories, first-person perspectives, and expert-backed information.
