Hudgens says she's in no rush to get married and have kids with Butler, whom she's been dating since 2011.\n\n\u201cI want to get married, travel, then have kids -- probably in my late 30s,\u201d she says.\n\nAs for the latest trend of quick celebrity engagements, she notes, \"Everyone\u2019s clock is different.\"\n\nHudgens says that the former Switched at Birth star inspires her more than anyone.\n\n\u201cWe both respect, trust, and admire each other,\" she shares about what makes their relationship work. \"It\u2019s so solid now because I feel strong as an independent woman. I am very self-reliant, but it\u2019s nice to have a best friend you can share victories with as well as losses.\u201d\n\nAs for currently being in incredible shape, Hudgens credits it to intermittent fasting, following a pescatarian diet and working out at least six days a week. She also admits she has been conscious about her weight since she turned 18, when she went on the High School Musical tour.\n\n\u201cWe were getting ready to go on the second leg of our tour, and it had been only two or three months, but the costume would not fit over my butt,\u201d she recalls. \u201cSo I had to pull it on over my head, and then it wouldn\u2019t zip up all the way, and I was like, \u201bWhat do you mean I can\u2019t eat Hot Cheetos and rice and beef jerky every day?\u2019 So I had to start making changes at an early age.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I do a scene that requires me to not have a lot of clothes on, I definitely get very strict with myself and cut sugar and carbs,\" she adds.\n\nDennis Leupold\n\nThese days, despite body insecurities, Hudgens has found a way to power through.\n\n\u201cBecause I\u2019m very petite, I\u2019ve always felt that women who are taller are smarter and more powerful,\u201d she admits. \u201cI would feel less than because of my size. I see how women who are 5\u20329\u2033 walk into a room, and I am so attracted to the space they take up. But then I started to realize that you can take up space without height -- with your achievements, points of view, and opinions. Now that I\u2019ve realized I can work through it, I\u2019m like, \u2018How do I make myself feel more confident?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I ever get to the point that I\u2019m not happy with my body, I\u2019ll do something about it,\u201d she also notes. \u201cYou will always have the power to do something. Sometimes it will take a little longer than you would like, and sometimes it may be a little more extreme. But if you honestly have a goal, you can do it. You just need to figure out the right way to get there.\u201d\n\nDennis Leupold\n\nET spoke to Hudgens in August, when she talked about her and Butler always \"having each other's backs.\" Watch the video below for more:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-09/gettyimages-1025188840.jpg?h=04e1f183&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2019-09/GettyImages-1059503152.jpg?h=e1c22784&width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-11/900_watermarked_whm120118feacoverstory_002.jpg?h=7cb94769", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-11/900_watermarked_whm120118feacoverstory_002.jpg?h=7cb94769&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-08/vanessa-hudgens-gettyimages-1025165848.jpg?h=3ae4097c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-11/900_watermarked_whm120118feacoverstory_002.jpg?h=7cb94769", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/vanessa-hudgens-isnt-looking-to-get-married-anytime-soon-despite-7-year-romance-with-austin-butler", "title": "Vanessa Hudgens Isn't Looking to Get Married Anytime Soon Despite 7-Year Romance With Austin Butler", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-11/900_watermarked_whm120118feacoverstory_002.jpg?h=7cb94769", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Vanessa Hudgens is perfectly content when it comes to her longtime relationship with boyfriend Austin Butler.", "title": "Vanessa Hudgens Isn't Looking to Get Married Anytime Soon", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/vanessa-hudgens-isnt-looking-to-get-married-anytime-soon-despite-7-year-romance-with-austin-butler", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Vanessa Hudgens is perfectly content when it comes to her longtime relationship with boyfriend Austin Butler.", "twitter": {"description": "Vanessa Hudgens is perfectly content when it comes to her longtime relationship with boyfriend Austin Butler.", "title": "Vanessa Hudgens Isn't Looking to Get Married Anytime Soon", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/vanessa-hudgens-isnt-looking-to-get-married-anytime-soon-despite-7-year-romance-with-austin-butler", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-11/900_watermarked_whm120118feacoverstory_002.jpg?h=7cb94769", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Vanessa Hudgens Isn't Looking to Get Married Anytime Soon Despite 7-Year Romance With Austin Butler | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Vanessa Hudgens", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
