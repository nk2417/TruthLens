She managed to piece together \u201csmall bits of information\u201d after a \u201cbrief refresh with john.\u201d\n\n\u201cit began with our friends (john\u2019s manager and co-writers and a couple others) talking about how BEAAAAAAUUUUTIFUL some of the women were \u2026 and they were! But in my mind they not only were talking about it, they were talking about it on purpose to rile me up,\u201d she recalled. \u201cLooking back and knowing how well I know them now, THEY WERE DEFINITELY RILING ME UP AND GETTING A KICK OUT OF IT.\u201d\n\nRelated: Chrissy Teigen\u2019s Most Entertaining Twitter Feuds Click through to relive Chrissy Teigen's most entertaining Twitter feuds\n\nTeigen tweeted that she \u201cwatched the monitor like a psychotic (tarantula) hawk\u201d while Legend, now 39, filmed one particular scene with a female costar. \u201cHe probably laughed at something she said. And in my mind it was some GRAND conversation I was conjuring up,\u201d she continued. \u201cThey were probably just talking about craft services honestly but in my mind she was like \u2018hey we should bone\u2019 and he was like \u2018haha f\u2013k yeah!\u2019\u201d\n\nEventually, after \u201ca few more shoulder touches and laughs,\u201d the Lip Sync Battle color commentator lost her cool. \u201cAnger turned to sobbing turned to fleeing the set and getting a hotel room,\u201d she recounted. \u201cThe director (ALAN FERGUSON!) was baffled. Everyone was. Anyhow I wish more happened but no. I was just a jealous, angry 22 year old. I\u2019m better now. BUT DONT TEST ME.\u201d\n\nThe video shoot was particularly sensitive for Teigen because she and the Grammy winner were first introduced on the 2007 set of his \u201cStereo\u201d visual. \u201cKeep in mind john and I met on a video,\u201d she reminded fans. \u201cI was that girl! I know how this s\u2013t works!\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Music Video Couples Showing off their love -- on and off screen! Some Hollywood A-list couples don't mind taking their work home. Here's to Beyonce and Jay Z, John Mayer and Katy, and other celebrity couples who've appeared in each other's music videos.\n\nWhen asked if her self-proclaimed \u201cmeltdown\u201d is the reason she now regards \u201cGreen Light\u201d as her least favorite Legend song, the model responded, \u201cmaybe subconsciously but mostly I just thought it was corny. LOVE YOU JOHNNY!!!!\u201d\n\nTeigen\u2019s moment of jealousy didn\u2019t last long, though. She and Legend went on to marry in Italy in September 2013. They share two children: daughter Luna, 2, and son Miles, 2 months.\n\nFun fact, I had a jealously-fueled meltdown visiting this video set and made an asshole out of myself to a large group of people. https://t.co/SiE3h9aisY \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 30, 2018\n\nmaybe subconsciously but mostly I just thought it was corny \ud83d\ude2c\ud83d\ude2c LOVE YOU JOHNNY!!!! https://t.co/03EkwIeXXB \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 30, 2018\n\nOh you want to know more, do you? Let me try to remember. 10 years is a long time! \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 30, 2018\n\nOk after a brief refresh with john, I have pieced together small bits of information \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 30, 2018\n\nit began with our friends (john\u2019s managers and co-writers and a couple others) talking about how BEAAAAAAUUUUTIFUL some of the women were\u2026 \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 30, 2018\n\n\u2026and they were! But in my mind they not only were talking about it, they were talking about it on purpose to rile me up. Looking back and knowing how well I know them now, THEY WERE DEFINITELY RILING ME UP AND GETTING A KICK OUT OF IT \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 30, 2018\n\nI was watching the monitor with all the guys and someone, I can\u2019t remember who, said, \u201cooooooo look at that girl with john ooooooooo!\u201d so I watched the monitor like a psychotic (tarantula) hawk and in my mind, oh he was in trouble \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 30, 2018\n\nKeep in mind john and I met on a video. I was that girl! I know how this shit works! \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 30, 2018\n\nHe probably laughed at something she said. And in my mind it was some GRAND conversation I was conjuring up. They were probably just talking about craft services honestly but in my mind she was like \u201chey we should bone\u201d and he was like \u201chaha fuck yeah!\u201d \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 30, 2018\n\nA few more shoulder touches and laughs with her later, I lost it. Anger turned to sobbing turned to fleeing the set and getting a hotel room. The director (ALAN FERGUSON!) was baffled. Everyone was. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 30, 2018\n\nAnyhow I wish more happened but no. I was just a jealous, angry 22 year old. I\u2019m better now. BUT DONT TEST ME \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 30, 2018\n\nWhat a boring story.
