All three entries in \u201cThe Matrix\u201d trilogy are heading to Netflix, as is the ambitious \u201cCloud Atlas,\u201d which means you\u2019ll be able to bring summer to an end by bingeing mind-melting science fiction.\n\nREAD MORE: Netflix Is Not the Problem: Why Bad Theatrical Presentations Are Destroying the Experience\n\nOther titles joining the streaming service include underrated gems from Quentin Tarantino and Michael Haneke, plus two of the year\u2019s most exciting documentary films. Check out a complete list of all the new movies joining Netflix in August 2017 below, including our 7 must-binge choices.\n\n\u201cThe Matrix\u201d Trilogy (August 1)\n\nAugust kicks off with \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d \u201cThe Matrix Reloaded\u201d and \u201cThe Matrix Revolutions\u201d all becoming available to stream on Netflix. Say what you want about the two sequels, but the original still remains one of the greatest movies of the 1990s. The Wachowskis mixed together Asian film wire work (choreographer Yuen Woo-ping) and gun play, cyber punk anime, some tricks of their own (bullet time) and philosophical texts to create a completely different type of Hollywood film.\n\n\u201cClouds Atlas\u201d (August 1)\n\nThe Wachowskis and Tim Twyker\u2019s \u201cCloud Atlas\u201d was probably too ambitious to ever have a shot at doing well at the box office, but the sprawling adaptation of David Mitchell\u2019s 2004 novel of the same name is exhilarating and profound from start to finish. Bolstered by the rhythmic editing from Alexander Berner and the gorgeous original score by Tykwer, Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil, \u201cCloud Atlas\u201d might just be the fastest 171 minutes you\u2019ll ever see.\n\n\u201cJackie Brown\u201d (August 1)\n\nMost people don\u2019t usually name \u201cJackie Brown\u201d when asked what the best Quentin Tarantino movie is, and with options like \u201cPulp Fiction,\u201d \u201cKill Bill\u201d and \u201cReservoir Dogs\u201d we certainly don\u2019t blame them. But \u201cJackie Brown\u201d is an overlooked gem that finds Tarantino mashing up 1970s blaxploitation with 1990s American crime. The stellar acting work from Pam Grier, Robert Forester and Robert De Niro doesn\u2019t hurt either.\n\n\u201cFunny Games\u201d (August 1)\n\nShot for shot remakes aren\u2019t always the best idea (see Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cPsycho\u201d), and while Michael Haneke\u2019s remake of his own 1997 home invasion thriller isn\u2019t as good, it\u2019s still a disturbing look at domestic decay and disturbed psychopaths. It\u2019s probably best if you haven\u2019t seen the original, but even if you have there\u2019s enough agonizing work from Naomi Watts and Michael Pitt that \u201cFunny Games\u201d gets in your head and refuses to leave.\n\n\u201cIcarus\u201d (August 4)\n\n\u201cIcarus\u201d starts out as one kind of movie, and then becomes a much better one. At first, director Bryan Fogel seems intent on making the sporting world\u2019s answer to \u201cSuper Size Me,\u201d by subjecting himself to performance-enhancing drugs to see if he can avoid detection. But then he stumbles into shocking revelations about Russia\u2019s massive doping conspiracy and the scenario gets dark, gripping, and altogether more important.\n\n\u201cAll These Sleepless Nights\u201d (August 15)\n\n\u201cAll These Sleepless Nights\u201d is a mesmeric, free-floating odyssey that wends its way through a hazy year in the molten lives of two Polish twentysomethings. It\u2019s an unclassifiable wonder that obscures the divide between fiction and documentary until the distinction is ultimately irrelevant. IndieWire recently named it one of the best documentaries of the 21st century.\n\n\u201cDonald Cried\u201d (August 15)\n\nKris Avedisian wrote, directed and played the title character in his feature debut, a melancholy spin on the buddy comedy in which the buddies are estranged and the comedy is pitch black. This is the kind of thoughtful, low-key drama the indie world needs more of, as well as a sign of great things to come from Avedisian. IndieWire named it one of the best indies of 2017 so far earlier this month.\n\nAvailable 8/1/17\n\n\u201cA Cinderella Story\u201d\n\n\u201cBad Santa\u201d\n\n\u201cCrematorium: Season 1\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s Hero\u201d\n\n\u201cInnerspace\u201d\n\n\u201cLord of War\u201d\n\n\u201cNola Circus\u201d\n\n\u201cOpening Night\u201d\n\n\u201cPractical Magic\u201d\n\n\u201cSmall Soldiers\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Addams Family\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Astronaut\u2019s Wife\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Bomb\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Last Mimzy\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Number 23\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Truth About Alcohol\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Wedding Party\u201d\n\n\u201cTie The Knot\u201d\n\n\u201cWho Gets the Dog?\u201d\n\n\u201cWild Wild West\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/2/17\n\n\u201cJab We Met\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Founder\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/3/17\n\n\u201cSing\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Invisible Guardian\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/5/17\n\n\u201cHoles\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/9/17\n\n\u201cBlack Site Delta\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/10/17\n\n\u201cDiary of an Exorcist\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/11/17\n\n\u201cNaked\u201d\n\n\u201cWhite Gold\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/13/17\n\n\u201cArthur and the Invisibles\u201d\n\n\u201cHot Property\u201d\n\n\u201cMission Control: The Unsung Heroes of Apollo\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/14/17\n\n\u201cThe Outcasts\u201d\n\n\u201cUrban Hymn\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/15/17\n\n\u201cBarbeque\u201d\n\n\u201cBrad Paisley\u2019s Comedy Rodeo\u201d\n\n\u201c21\u201d\n\n\u201cA New Economy\u201d\n\n\u201cMy Ex-Ex\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sweet Life\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/16/17\n\n\u201cGold\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/18/17\n\n\u201cI Am Sam\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat Happened to Monday\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/19/17\n\n\u201cHide and Seek\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/20/17\n\n\u201cCamera Store\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/21/17\n\n\u201cAWOL\u201d\n\n\u201cBad Rap\u201d\n\n\u201cBeautiful Creatures\u201d\n\n\u201cUnacknowledged\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/22/17\n\n\u201cLynne Koplitz: Hormonal Beast\u201d\n\n\u201cSadie\u2019s Last Days on Earth\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/23/17\n\n\u201cFeel Rich\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/25/17\n\n\u201cDeath Note\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/29/17\n\n\u201cBring It On: Worldwide #Cheersmack\u201d\n\n\u201cRyan Hamilton: Happy Face\u201d\n\nAvailable 8/31/17\n\n\u201cBe Afraid\u201d\n\nStay on top of the latest film and TV news!
