We went back to 2012 and charted the course of their relationship, and the couple has been divided over two big issues for years.\n\n2012 - The first date\n\nAfter working together for years, John Cena surprised Nikki Bella by asking her out in 2012, months after filing for divorce from his first wife.\n\nVia Cosmopolitan:\n\nhttps://www.eonline.com/shows/total_divas/news/700620/john-cena-tells-nikki-bella-talking-about-pregnancy-makes-him-get-the-sweats-watch-the-total-divas-clip\n\nLate 2015/Early 2016 - Dolph Ziggler offers 'marriage, babies' to Nikki Bella\n\nIn a shocking development, Nikki Bella revealed that WWE star Dolph Ziggler, who dated prior to Bella's relationship with Cena, wants to marry her.\n\n\"Dolph pulled me aside at work and told me that he wants to give me marriage and babies. And then he tried to kiss me.\"\n\nZiggler had approached Bella back in 2015 to tell her that he still had feelings for her. Prior to WrestleMania 33, The Miz roasted Cena - who \"stole his girlfriend from Dolph Ziggler\" - on an episode of Talking Smack.\n\nApril 21st, 2016 - Cena confirms he's still opposed to marriage and to having children in a Rolling Stone profile\n\nRolling Stone profiled Cena just after WrestleMania 32, and he went public with some very strong views on marriage and having kids.\n\nVia Rolling Stone:\n\n\u201cJust because everyone else is happy with children doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s how I have to live,\u201d Cena said. \u201cI\u2019ve been upfront about this. I just have things I need to get done. It\u2019s not negotiable. We\u2019ve been to therapy over it. I don\u2019t think it will ever be over with. I\u2019m stubborn as [expletive] and extremely selfish as well. I don\u2019t want kids, I don\u2019t want marriage. That\u2019s me just saying, \u2018Hey, this is my life and this is how I\u2019m going to live.\u201d\n\nOctober 5th, 2016 - The Total Bellas premiere\n\nCena came off as an extremely rigid creature of habit when television cameras entered his home.
