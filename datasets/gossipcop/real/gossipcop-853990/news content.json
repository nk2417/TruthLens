The bride-to-be was spotted leaving the Santi London beauty spa in South Kensington, described as a \"beautiful cross between an uber-boutique spa and a beauty clinic\", which prides itself on tailor-made treatments for its clients. The spa offers an extensive menu; from a \u00a370 aromatherapy massage, to a \u00a360 Santi Glow facial treatment, which combines skin polishing and oxygen infusion to fully renew the skin, and a deluxe manicure at \u00a340.\n\nPippa Middleton and James Matthews will marry in St Mark's Church, Englefield on Saturday\n\nPippa, 33, also appears to have been following a strict exercise regime in the lead up to her wedding, regularly attending the luxury gym, Grace Belgravia. The women-only Knightsbridge facility, where a lifetime membership reportedly costs \u00a355,000, includes a gym, day spa and a medicinal clinic.\n\nSTORY: Pippa Middleton's wedding: how she's spending the final week of preparations\n\nOn Saturday 20 May, Pippa and her fianc\u00e9 James Matthews, 41, will say \"I do\" at St Mark's Church in Englefield \u2013 a Grade 1-listed country church that dates back to the 13th century. The couple have asked Rev, Nick Wynne- Jones, the resident priest at St Mark's to officiate the ceremony. Guests will then head to the Middleton family's home in Bucklebury, seven miles away, for the wedding reception. This week, a large, glass conservatory-style structure was seen being installed in the garden of the seven-bedroom Berkshire property, ready for the evening celebrations.\n\n\u00a9 Photo: Getty Images\n\nThe bride's sister Kate will attend with Prince William, and their two children\n\nLarge crowds are expected to turn out to see the arrival of famous guests at the wedding, foremost among them the bride's elder sister, the Duchess of Cambridge.
