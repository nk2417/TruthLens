Because I've got a great life,\" she said. \"I am more concerned about her than I am about me. Equal pay for equal work!\"\n\nJessica Chastain is featured on the cover of the June 6, 2018 issue of \"The Hollywood Reporter.\" The Hollywood Reporter\n\nChastain, who has her own production company, told THR that once she found out about what Spencer was being offered on their upcoming Christmas comedy, she knew she had to act.\n\n\"Your silence is your discrimination,\" she said. \"So if you are succeeding in an environment where there is discrimination, you are actively being discriminatory.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I knew women of color got paid less than Caucasian actresses. What I didn\u2019t know is someone of Octavia\u2019s level, who had an Oscar and two Oscar nominations, how much less she would be getting paid. When she told me what she was making, that\u2019s what really made me go, 'Hold up, that doesn\u2019t compute in my brain.'\"\n\nSpencer first revealed how Chastain helped her make five times more back in January during a panel at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nOctavia Spencer is pictured in New York, May 21, 2018.

We\u2019re going to be favored nations and we\u2019re gonna make the same thing, you are going to make that amount.\u2019 Fast-forward to last week, we\u2019re making five times what we asked for,\" Spencer concluded.\n\nShe applauded Chastain for not just taking up her cause, but the crusade for gender equality.\n\n\"She provided a much-needed shoulder and listened,\" Spencer told The Hollywood Reporter. \"And then she did what she always does: She took up my cause and made it her own. As a friend, she\u2019s your biggest cheerleader; but as a colleague, she\u2019s your most vocal advocate.\"\n\nJessica Chastain poses during a photo call for 'Molly's Game', Jan. 29, 2018 in Sydney.

You wonder: These incredible actresses, where are they now? Why did they disappear for so long?,\" Chastain explained. \"It was a system that wasn\u2019t working. And so I thought, \u2018Well, what if we now take the power and give it to the actresses?\u2019\"", "images": ["https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/bf2f8ed5-a320-4d7e-b583-179abe072d92/trump-signs-shutdown-bill-20251112-ap-jh_1763006747268_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/009e3420-a5ae-477a-aeb3-edfa85648814/johnson-2-gty-jef-251118_1763480583977_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a904a3c1-1e2d-4174-9130-e846e8059dee/carnivaldeath_1762746067738_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/random/svg/gma_logo.svg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/octavia-spencer-jessica-chastain-gty-thg-180606_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/hollywood-reporter-jessica-chastain-cover-june-2018-ht-jc-180606_hpEmbed_10x13_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/octavia-spencer-gty-thg-180606_hpEmbed.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/7669390d-d027-4ec7-9673-1d2eccafbbec/comey-gty-er-251117_1763404424377_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/jessica-chastain-gty-thg-180606_hpEmbed_19x14_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/octavia-spencer-jessica-chastain-gty-thg-180606_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "https://assets-cdn.abcotvs.net/static/images/DisneyPlus.svg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/octavia-spencer-jessica-chastain-gty-thg-180606_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/jessica-chastain-explains-fought-equal-pay-octavia-spencer/story?id=55691417", "title": "Jessica Chastain explains why she fought for equal pay for Octavia Spencer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/jessica-chastain-explains-fought-equal-pay-octavia-spencer/story?id=55691417", "title": "Jessica Chastain explains why she fought for equal pay for Octavia Spencer", "description": "The actress has become a vocal advocate for equal pay in Hollywood.", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/octavia-spencer-jessica-chastain-gty-thg-180606_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "type": "article"}, "description": "The actress has become a vocal advocate for equal pay in Hollywood.", "keywords": "Jessica Chastain, Octavia Spencer , Article, 55691417", "theme-color": "#fff", "copyright": "2025 ABC News", "author": "ABC News", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "Jessica Chastain explains why she fought for equal pay for Octavia Spencer", "lastPublishedDate": "2018-06-06T17:30:06Z", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,55691417", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,55691417", "googleplay": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/jessica-chastain-explains-fought-equal-pay-octavia-spencer/story?id=55691417"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "ABC News", "title": "Jessica Chastain explains why she fought for equal pay for Octavia Spencer", "description": "The actress has become a vocal advocate for equal pay in Hollywood.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/jessica-chastain-explains-fought-equal-pay-octavia-spencer/story?id=55691417", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/octavia-spencer-jessica-chastain-gty-thg-180606_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "width": 640, "height": 360}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,55691417", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,55691417", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for ipad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/jessica-chastain-explains-fought-equal-pay-octavia-spencer/story?id=55691417", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/jessica-chastain-explains-fought-equal-pay-octavia-spencer/story?id=55691417"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
