He saw success with \u201cLove Never Felt So Good\u201d on the posthumous Michael Jackson album \"Xscape\" in 2014. There was also his happy-go-lucky No. 1 single \u201cCan't Stop The Feeling\u201d from the \"Trolls\" motion picture soundtrack in 2016. He also dabbled in voice acting, donning the role of lead character Branch in the animated film.\n\nAlthough Timberlake hasn't completely disappeared from the music world since his last record, some fans have been tweeting that they are ready to hear some new solo material from him.\n\n\u2014Kanye's God Complex (@Gerwld) June 22, 2017\n\nThe good news is that the veteran crooner has been leaving a paper trail that suggests he could have a new project on the way. For fans who haven't been paying close attention, here are three signs that the official announcement of a new Justin Timberlake album could come along any day now.\n\n1. Pharrell Williams spilled some beans\n\n... A post shared by Justin Timberlake (@justintimberlake) on Mar 28, 2017 at 7:37pm PDT Mar 28, 2017 at 7:37pm PDT\n\nPharrell Williams, who worked closely with Justin Timberlake on his debut solo album, \"Justified,\" confirmed on \"Today\" on Tuesday that new Timberlake music does in fact exist, and it's going to be good.\n\n\u201cI have work to do,\u201d Williams said. \u201cMusic to make. And so many records: Ariana Grande\u2019s album is amazing. The Justin Timberlake album is amazing.\u201d\n\nIn March, Timberlake posted the photo above on Instagram. In the photo, he\u2019s seated between Timbaland, who co-produced \"FutureSex/LoveSounds,\" and Pharrell, which gave us another clue about the future production of the yet-to-be titled album.\n\n2. This Justin Timberlake tweet\n\nIn March, a fan tweeted at Timberlake requesting new music, as he was tired of playing \"The 20/20 Experience\" over and over to get his JT fix. Timberlake quickly responded, \"On the way....\" The singer didn't offer much detail after that, which is still a tease, but it was more than enough to feed the curiosity around the album.\n\n3. Timberlake revealed the album's direction\n\nTimberlake was open about the sound of his next album during a November interview with \"Variety.\" He revealed that it would be much different from his last.\n\n\"I wouldn't say [my new material] is the antithesis of \"20/20,\" but it does sound more singular,\" Timberlake said. \"If '20/20' sounded like it literally surrounds your entire head, this stuff feels more like it just punches you between the eyes.\"\n\nBased on their recording sessions thus far, Pharrell told \"Variety\" that he believed Timberlake was coming into his own as an artist with this record.\n\n\"I would pay Justin a huge compliment to say he\u2019s just discovering who he is now,\" Pharrell said.\n\nWhen asked about the album's release date, Timberlake said, \u201cI\u2019ll put it out when it\u2019s done \u2014 when it feels right.\u201d\n\nUntil that day comes, he'll likely continue dropping hints to keep his fans on their toes.", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/56fe8b9b918a0f40313cf1de?width=150&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "https://i.insider.com/5956a884bb350308a45a04f2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5956a884bb350308a45a04f2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nateleg\u00e9 Whaley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/new-justin-timberlake-2017-6", "title": "We have reason to believe a new Justin Timberlake album could be on its way", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "We have reason to believe a new Justin Timberlake album could be on its way", "datePublished": "2017-06-30T21:14:00.000Z", "dateModified": "2017-06-30T21:14:30.000Z", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Culture, Music", "description": "It's been a long time since we've seen a new album from Justin Timberlake, but these hints prove that new music might just be on its way.", "author": "Nateleg\u00e9 Whaley", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "tbi-vertical": "Entertainment", "og": {"title": "We have reason to believe a new Justin Timberlake album could be on its way", "description": "It's been a long time since we've seen a new album from Justin Timberlake, but these hints prove that new music might just be on its way.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/new-justin-timberlake-2017-6", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/5956a884bb350308a45a04f2?width=1200&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noindex", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"psvp": "c"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "5956a885bb350308a45a04f4", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"sections": "Entertainment", "tags": "Page Type:story"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2025-05", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
