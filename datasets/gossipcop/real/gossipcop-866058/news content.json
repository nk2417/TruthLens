Each gentleman comes with his own set of controversy; Jordan, the younger brother of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, has been accused of cheating on his former girlfriend and of going on The Bachelorette for the fame he never found through pro football. Meanwhile, JoJo and Robby have fought over whether the former Olympic swimmer broke up with his long-term girlfriend just to sign up for the dating series.\n\nThat\u2019s quite a lot of baggage, but nothing the Texan can\u2019t handle. Ahead of the season 12 finale, The Hollywood Reporter spoke with JoJo about why she feels so strongly about her two athletes.\n\n\u201cMy favorite quality about Robby is how open he is with his emotions,\u201d JoJo tells THR. \u201cHow he\u2019s able to really put himself out there and be completely vulnerable.\u201d\n\nShe continues, \u201cHe was the first guy to tell me that he loved me and he stayed that way consistently.\u201d\n\nRobby told the bachelorette he loved her during their first one-on-one date in Uruguay. On their fantasy suite date last Monday, JoJo shared with the Florida man that his use of the \u201cL-word\u201d early on helped her open up and trust him.\n\nTrust has been far more challenging in her relationship with Jordan. For the past few weeks, JoJo has expressed concerns with the 27-year-old, culminating in a tough conversation before their night together in the fantasy suite. JoJo grilled the former quarterback to determine if he could commit to \u201cforever\u201d and admitted his instability made her \u201cnervous.\u201d She added, \u201cIt makes me feel that in six months you can get a phone call and be like, \u2018Well, peace! I\u2019m out.\u201d\n\nBut both on the show and when speaking with THR, she seems to put her worries aside. \u201cWith Jordan, my favorite thing about him was his ability to put me at ease and to make me laugh and in a lot of situations where I should have been very nervous,\u201d JoJo tells THR.\n\nShe adds, \u201cHe was one of the only guys who was able to ease that for me. We had a really great friendship, relationship, romance. There was a lot there.\u201d\n\nABC\u2019s previews of Monday night\u2019s finale (below) show that JoJo\u2019s final decision will be an emotional one. Stay tuned for the big moment to see who JoJo picks when The Bachelorette and After the Final Rose kickoff at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.
