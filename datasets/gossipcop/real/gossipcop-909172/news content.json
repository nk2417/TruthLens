The two are not looking to get back together following her split from Younes Bendjima, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively.\n\nRelated: Kourtney Kardashian and Younes Bendjima: The Way They Were From Los Angeles to France, Kourtney Kardashian can\u2019t stop showing off her hot romance with model Younes Bendjima \u2014 click through to see the couple\u2019s sexiest moments\n\n\u201cNothing with Scott is rumored or even remotely on the horizon at all, so while people will inevitably try to spin it and say he\u2019ll try and get back with her, they aren\u2019t going to,\u201d the insider explains. \u201cHe and Sofia [Richie] are happy where they are now and they\u2019re simply doing their own thing, and Scott and Kourtney are coparenting their kids as they have been with great success.\u201d (The exes share Mason, 8, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 3.)\n\nThe source adds: \u201cScott will always love and be there for Kourtney and is just happy that they are on good terms for the sake of their kids. He has Sofia and doesn\u2019t want to be bothered with any drama.\u201d\n\nRelated: Scott Disick and Sofia Richie: A Timeline of Their Relationship A rocky romance. Scott Disick and Sofia Richie couldn\u2019t have been more in love after sparking up a relationship in 2017 \u2014 but the duo\u2019s flame eventually fizzled out nearly three years later. The Flip It Like Disick star was first seen cozying up to the model, who is 16 years his junior, during a [\u2026]\n\nUs confirmed on Tuesday, August 7, that Kardashian, 39, and Bendjima broke up the same day photos surfaced of the 26-year-old model with another woman in Mexico. He denied being unfaithful, though the reality star\u2019s sisters, Kim Kardashian and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, called him out on social media on Tuesday. \u201cShe ended it because it just wasn\u2019t working anymore,\u201d a source told Us. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t any dramatic moment.\u201d\n\nJust last month, Kris Jenner opened up about the possibility of her eldest daughter reuniting with Disick, 35. \u201cI don\u2019t think that anybody can ever predict what\u2019s going to happen with this family, so I\u2019ve learned long ago to not really make my judgment on the different couple relationships when there\u2019s a rift, especially with Scott, because Scott\u2019s like my family,\u201d the momager, 62, exclusively told Us on July 24. \u201cI love him very much. I feel like he\u2019s my son, and he\u2019s been around for going on 13 years, I think, and he\u2019s the father of my grandchildren, so with us it\u2019s like he\u2019s family. So I look at it much differently from the inside than somebody might look at it from the outside.\u201d\n\nRelated: Kardashian-Jenner Family\u2019s Biggest Controversies and Scandals All the drama! Over the years, the Kardashian-Jenner family has made headlines for the ups and downs that occurred in their personal and professional lives.

And all I really care about is that the kids are happy. I want happiness for my children, of course, but my grandkids, it\u2019s really important that they stay really happy and grounded and they understand what\u2019s going on in this transition, and I think everybody\u2019s doing OK.\u201d\n\nAfter a brief split in June, Us broke the news in July that Disick was taking the next step with Richie, 19, whom he has been dating since September 2017. \u201cScott and Sofia are moving in together,\u201d an insider revealed at the time. \u201cShe\u2019ll move into his house.\u201d\n\nWith reporting by Carly Sloane and Brody Brown", "images":
