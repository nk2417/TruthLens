I didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d heard of her, but she\u2019s a friend of mine.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres then pointed to the music video\u2019s success (it\u2019s been viewed more than 425 million times since it premiered during the MTV VMAs late last month), but noted that it \u201ccould have been better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was in the original, because I\u2019m part of her squad,\u201d the comedian explained. \u201cApparently, she cut me out \u2026 I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s threatened by me sometimes. Nice try, Tay-Tay, \u2019cause I got my hands on the real video. So, I\u2019m gonna share it with all of you for the first time.\u201d\n\nThe video spoof shows DeGeneres edited into several major scenes, including the one of Swift in a bathtub full of diamonds; DeGeneres lounges casually on the opposite end of the tub, playing with strands of glittering jewels as Swift expounds an unnamed nemesis.\n\nAt another point, DeGeneres pretends to be on the other end of the line when Swift delivers her piercing statement: \u201cThe old Taylor can\u2019t come to the phone right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d DeGeneres demands.\n\n\u201cWhy? Oh, \u2019cause she\u2019s dead,\u201d Swift replies.\n\n\u201cThen who am I playing footsies with?\u201d DeGeneres asks, looking puzzled. \u201cSomebody\u2019s got a little attitude today.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the spoof, DeGeneres shows off her own collection of former selves, including \u201cTipsy,\u201d \u201cScarlett Kardashian,\u201d \u201ccowboy Ellen\u201d and \u201ctwerking Ellen,\u201d whom she dubs her favorite.\n\nWatch the clip above.", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ellen-swift-62f0c614-6b0d-4296-9fbe-1983d0003cd6.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ellen-swift-62f0c614-6b0d-4296-9fbe-1983d0003cd6.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/ellen-degeneres-spoofs-taylor-swifts-look-what-you-made-me-do-video-watch-197784/", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres Spoofs Taylor Swift's Look What You Made Me Do", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Ellen DeGeneres inserts herself into Swift's visual narrative, including diamond-filled bathtub scene.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Joyce Chen", "tags": "Ellen DeGeneres, Taylor Swift", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres Spoofs Taylor Swift's 'Look What You Made Me Do': Watch", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/ellen-degeneres-spoofs-taylor-swifts-look-what-you-made-me-do-video-watch-197784/", "description": "Ellen DeGeneres inserts herself into Swift's visual narrative, including diamond-filled bathtub scene.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ellen-swift-62f0c614-6b0d-4296-9fbe-1983d0003cd6.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "width": 1401, "height": 788, "alt": "ELLEN - Taylor Swift Spoof"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-22T18:19:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T14:48:21+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ellen DeGeneres inserts herself into Swift's visual narrative, including diamond-filled bathtub scene.", "site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ellen DeGeneres Spoofs Taylor Swift\u2019s \u2018Look What You Made Me Do\u2019 Video: Watch", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ellen-swift-62f0c614-6b0d-4296-9fbe-1983d0003cd6.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506104376.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
