(Photo by Jonathan Ferrey/Getty Images)\n\nBow Wow ended up clowning himself earlier this week when he was caught lying about flying in a private jet on Instagram. After he was exposed as flying commercial like the rest of us, Twitter briefly became good again as users focused their creative energies on owning the TV host via the #BowWowChallenge.\n\nThis morning, the rapper-turned-tv-personality-turned-meme sat down with Hot 97 to promote his upcoming WE tv show Growing Up Hip Hop Atlanta, and addressed the false private jet picture before the hosts could even ask.\n\n\u201cI just wanna say, off top, I love it,\u201d Bow Wow said about the #BowWowChallenge. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand the scientific method to my madness. I\u2019m about to have to the biggest show on WE tv, period. It\u2019s a scientific method to my madness. You gotta just watch the show. Everything\u2019s for the show.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, so you\u2019re admitting that this is a troll,\u201d host Laura Stylez inquired.\n\n\u201cYou gotta watch the show,\u201d Bow Wow reiterated.\n\nIf the \u201cmadness\u201d here refers to promoting his show, I\u2019d argue the method has worked. How many of us would have even known Bow Wow had a TV show if the #BowWowMemeChallenge had never happened?\n\nWatch the full interview below.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=P2W0ItsDexo%3Fecver%3D1", "images": ["https://www.spin.com/app/themes/spin/public/images/svg/logo.bacb61.svg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2025/01/GettyImages-2196894108-340x227.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=557085890510243&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://static.spin.com/files/2025/04/Secondary-General-Use-Photo-Credit_-Thistle-Brown-340x226.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2025/11/leaduse2025-10-12_LCP_DGHWT_PassingTheCrown_LawrenceSumulong-0148-340x226.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2025/11/DSC00092_DxO_5MB-340x227.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2025/10/SPIN-Print-Fall2025-1200x.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5703a38df87ca718f4cb5cb9dfac89b7076f42661a82b1639960d6af6fb21c39?s=48&d=mm&r=g", "https://static.spin.com/files/2025/11/GettyImages-1054524238-340x227.jpg", "https://static.spin.com/files/2017/05/bowwow-1494512349.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.spin.com/files/2017/05/bowwow-1494512349.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Josephs"], "canonical_link": "https://www.spin.com/2017/05/bow-wow-picture-meme-response/", "title": "Bow Wow Responds to Fake Private Jet Photo: \u201cIt\u2019s a Scientific Method to My Madness\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"title": "Bow Wow Responds to Fake Private Jet Photo: \u201cIt\u2019s a Scientific Method to My Madness\u201d", "description": "Bow Wow ended up clowning himself earlier this week when he was caught lying about flying in a private jet on Instagram.
