And if it's tight on me, so what? It doesn't matter if it was made for a girl.\"\n\nHadid, 22, agrees, saying: \"Totally. It's not about gender. It's about, like, shapes. And what feels good on you that day.\n\n\"And anyway, it's fun to experiment.\"\n\nINEZ AND VINOODH/VOGUE\n\nVogue writer Maya Singer comments in the piece, in US Vogue's August issue, that for many young people \"gender is a more or less arbitrary distraction\" and that there is \"a terrific opportunity for play\".\n\nShe says \"this new blase attitude toward gender codes marks a radical break\", adding: \"For these millennials, at least, descriptives like boy or girl rank pretty low on the list of important qualities - and the way they dress reflects that.\"\n\n'Such a big jump'\n\nBut poet Tyler Ford, who's quoted in the accompanying article exploring gender norms, tweeted (with an eyeroll emoji): \"The only mention of the word 'trans' is by me via interview.\"\n\nJournalist and author Hannah Orenstein said she would have preferred Tyler to have been profiled instead of Hadid and Malik, tweeting: \"Zayn and Gigi are profiled in this piece on gender fluidity because... they borrow each other's clothes sometimes?\"\n\nAnother reader noted on Twitter: \"Y'all notice Zayn isn't out here wearing dresses.\"\n\nAnd Colette Fahy wrote: \"All Z & G say is that they borrow each other's clothes. Such a big jump for the mag to declare gender fluidity.\"\n\nIn a statement issued on Friday, a Vogue spokeswoman said: \"The story was intended to highlight the impact the gender-fluid, non-binary communities have had on fashion and culture.\n\n\"We are very sorry the story did not correctly reflect that spirit - we missed the mark.\n\n\"We do look forward to continuing the conversation with greater sensitivity.\"", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/mcs/media/images/76020000/jpg/_76020974_line976.jpg", "https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/A2FB/production/_96932714_zayn_vogue2.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/180DB/production/_96932589_zayn_vogue1.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7353/production/_96932592_zayn_vogue2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7353/production/_96932592_zayn_vogue2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-40608053", "title": "Vogue sorry for Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik 'gender fluid' claim", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "page.section": "Culture", "page.subsection": "Entertainment_and_arts", "og": {"title": "Vogue sorry for Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik 'gender fluid' claim", "description": "Some weren't happy that the magazine said Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid were \"gender fluid\".", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7353/production/_96932592_zayn_vogue2.jpg", "alt": "Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid in Vogue"}}, "twitter": {"title": "Vogue sorry for Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik 'gender fluid' claim", "description": "Some weren't happy that the magazine said Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid were \"gender fluid\".", "image": {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/7353/production/_96932592_zayn_vogue2.jpg", "alt": "Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid in Vogue"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Some weren't happy that the magazine said Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid were \"gender fluid\".", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364147881, app-argument=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-40608053", "version": "web-2.33.2-3", "al": {"ios": {"url": "bbcx://news/entertainment-arts-40608053", "app_store_id": 364147881, "app_name": "BBC: World News & Stories"}, "android": {"url": "bbcx://news/entertainment-arts-40608053", "app_name": "BBC: World News & Stories", "package": "bbc.mobile.news.ww"}, "web": {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-40608053"}}, "cXenseParse": {"pageclass": "article", "publishtime": "2017-07-14T12:52:16.000Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2017-07-14T22:33:36.000Z"}, "next-head-count": 41}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.bbc.com", "summary": ""}
