{"url": "https://www.who.com.au/second-act-jennifer-lopez-vanessa-hudgens-movie-review", "text": "For her first onscreen film role in three years, Jennifer Lopez slips seamlessly back into a genre she used to dominate: the lightweight comedy. In fact, with its false identity premise, Second Act (watch the trailer below) bears more than a passing resemblance to 2002\u2019s Maid in Manhattan, but instead of a hotel employee with ideas above her station, she plays a Whole Foods-type grocery store\u2019s assistant manager who is passed over for promotion, only to trick her way into a fancy new job under false credentials.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHired as a consultant for a major beauty company, Lopez\u2019s character, Maya, finds herself going head-to-head with hotshot young executive Zoe (Vanessa Hudgens) in a race against the clock to create a new skincare line. Can Maya prove her lack of tertiary education doesn\u2019t prevent her from excelling? And what of her relationship with boyfriend Trey (Milo Ventimiglia), who is tried of waiting to start a family?\n\n(Credit: Roadshow)\n\nIf that were the extent of the plot, Second Act would be a fun but predictable journey towards the inevitable comeuppance for the doubters, but a whole other storyline unfolds that makes the exercise even more preposterous. If you can suspend your disbelief, this is harmless frivolity, with plenty of scene-stealing moments from co-star Leah Remini; if you can\u2019t, admire Lopez and Hudgens\u2019 array of stunning outfits instead. (Out now) 3 stars\n\nRelated\n\nAdvertisement", "images": ["https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/media/26172/second_unit_00652r2.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/media/26172/second_unit_00652r2.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2024/06/whw_2542-691e7c8197cb4.jpg?resize=444%2C581", "https://www.who.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2024/10/mary-fowler-nathan-cleary-1920-x-1080-px.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/11/mm_who2547_netflix-3-691e5cdb44e97.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/10/ntlhero-2025-10-27t145850.743-68feedfd5c836.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/11/rolling-lloud-691e98255d866.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/11/mandy_who2546_supplied-1-691e7beb070db.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2024/12/australian-idol-2025-header.png?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2024/11/herolandscape-47-690aad1a176f7.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/10/herolandscape-39-69016b6338c09.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://www.who.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2024/06/Logo.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/05/ntlhero-2025-05-30t133341.043-6839271ac0ce5.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/11/feature-1920-x-1000-px-1-691e91fa66828.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/11/rolling-lloud-691ea2d94bf05.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/11/dom-dolla-hero-2-691d4a80bf3ab.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.who.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/icon-phosphor-circle.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2018/04/gavin-headshot-for-author-bio.jpg?fit=95%2C128", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2025/11/amyl-and-the-sniffers-1-691e6f9a73c05.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/media/26173/second_unit_01644r.jpg?resize=1024%2C694"], "top_img": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/media/26172/second_unit_00652r2.jpg?resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gavin Scott", "After Cutting His Teeth On Teen Titles Smash Hits", "Tv Hits", "Remember Them", "In The", "Gavin Moved Into Weekly Magazines", "Working For Tv Week For Many Years", "Continuing To Contribute To That Title To This Day", "Writing For Who", "Woman S Day"], "canonical_link": "https://www.who.com.au/entertainment/second-act-jennifer-lopez-vanessa-hudgens-movie-review/", "title": "REVIEW: \u2018Second Act\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "taboola-author": "Gavin Scott", "taboola-category": "ENTERTAINMENT", "taboola-section": "entertainment", "taboola-pub-date": "2018-12-06T11:53:30+11:00", "taboola-updated-date": "2024-06-04T06:37:36+10:00", "taboola-title": "REVIEW: \u2018Second Act\u2019", "taboola-description": "<p>Jennifer Lopez is back in cinemas, but what's the verdict on her new comedy film?</p>", "taboola-image-url": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/media/26172/second_unit_00652r2.jpg?fit=1500%2C800", "taboola-tags": "Comedy, Film, Film Review, Jennifer Lopez, Latest Film Review, Latest Movie Review, Milo Ventimiglia, Movie, Movie Review, Second Act, Vanessa Hudgens", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Jennifer Lopez is back in cinemas in new romantic comedy movie Second Act, also starring Vanessa Hudgens, Milo Ventimiglia and Leah Remini, about a woman hired under false pretences to work for a cosmetic company.
