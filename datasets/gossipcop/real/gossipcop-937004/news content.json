Lady Jane, who made a speech at her younger sister Diana's funeral, gave the only reading -- from the Song of Solomon -- at the wedding ceremony.\n\nThe ring\n\nHarry designed Duchess Meghan's ring with a central cushion-cut diamond from Botswana and two brilliant cut diamonds on the outside that belonged to his late mother.\n\nThe hymn\n\nThe hymn \u201cGuide Me, O Thy Great Redeemer,\u201dsung at the wedding, was also sung during Diana\u2019s funeral.\n\nThe flowers\n\nPrince Harry picked flowers from the gardens of Kensington Palace to include in his bride's bouquet, which was designed by florist Philippa Craddock.\n\n\"The spring blooms include Forget-Me-Nots which were Diana, Princess of Wales\u2019 favorite flower. The couple specifically chose them to be included in Ms. Markle\u2019s bouquet to honour the memory of the late Princess on this special day,\" Kensington Palace said in a statement.\n\nThe singer\n\nElton John, who performed a reworked version of Candle in the Wind at Diana's funeral, was a guest at the wedding and performed at the lunchtime reception.\n\n\"Prince Harry asked Sir Elton to perform at the Reception which was hosted by Her Majesty The Queen at St George's Hall, Windsor Castle,\" Kensington Palace said in a statement. \"Sir Elton performed for the newly married couple in recognition of the close connection he has with Prince Harry and his family,\" the palace added.\n\nThe charities\n\nThe couple asked that charitable donations be made in lieu of wedding gifts. Two of their chosen charities are dedicated to causes Diana supported. The Children's HIV Association (CHIVA) provides resources for HIV positive children and young adults in Ireland and the U.K., and Crisis provides homeless people in England, Scotland and Wales with support, counsel and courses.", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/325fab7218200d61fb9b806879312fe98b7ed290/c=0-152-3000-1847/local/-/media/2018/05/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636623303065435894-AP-Britain-Royal-We-99995671.JPG?width=3000&height=1695&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gciaf/prod/p?a=pageview&p=USAT-TEALIUM-TANGENT&m=web&k=f14ebdd6-0569-4c64-af73-99937bc06379&s=noscript", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/presto/2020/12/01/USAT/67933d9a-05ea-438b-b11e-385393232ae3-Oyanga_Jane.jpg?crop=189,189,x0,y32&width=48&height=48&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/325fab7218200d61fb9b806879312fe98b7ed290/c=0-152-3000-1847/local/-/media/2018/05/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636623303065435894-AP-Britain-Royal-We-99995671.JPG?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/325fab7218200d61fb9b806879312fe98b7ed290/c=0-152-3000-1847/local/-/media/2018/05/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636623303065435894-AP-Britain-Royal-We-99995671.JPG?width=3000&height=1695&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/05/19/meghan-and-harry-honor-princess-diana-royal-wedding/625844002/", "title": "How Prince Harry and Meghan Markle honored Princess Diana at their wedding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "How Prince Harry and Meghan Markle honored Princess Diana at their wedding", "description": "The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex honored the beloved princess in a number of ways.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/05/19/meghan-and-harry-honor-princess-diana-royal-wedding/625844002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/325fab7218200d61fb9b806879312fe98b7ed290/c=0-152-3000-1847/local/-/media/2018/05/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636623303065435894-AP-Britain-Royal-We-99995671.JPG?width=3000&height=1695&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3000, "height": 1695}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Jane Onyanga-Omara", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex honored the beloved princess in a number of ways.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 1279862243338849}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/325fab7218200d61fb9b806879312fe98b7ed290/c=0-152-3000-1847/local/-/media/2018/05/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636623303065435894-AP-Britain-Royal-We-99995671.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "How Prince Harry and Meghan Markle honored Princess Diana at their wedding", "description": "The new Duke and Duchess of Sussex honored the beloved princess in a number of ways."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526702400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
