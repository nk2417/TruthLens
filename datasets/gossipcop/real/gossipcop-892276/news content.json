Although Kardashian assured WWD that she wants to release new items monthly, she added that she might \u201cnot have as many drops [as Jenner] and I don\u2019t have all the color kits that she does.\u201d\n\nInstead of focusing on bold lipsticks and bold eye shadow palettes, Kardashian plans to focus on skin. A concealer kit will come out in about two months, WWD reports. \u201cA lot of my stuff is going to be for skin.\u2026[I\u2019m] trying to mirror skin care with makeup,\" Kardashian told the publication. \"It\u2019s going to be a different vibe; it\u2019s not going to be a full color cosmetics [range] with shadows and all of that to start. I will probably do some kits here and there of specific [makeup] looks I\u2019ve done and keep it within the looks.\"\n\nAnother difference is that the upcoming Creme Contour & Highlight Kit probably won't sell out as quick as the first Lip Kits did. That's a good thing. Why? Kardashian worked with Seed Beauty to prepare for the demand. \u201cWe have a good model, and even from our lip kit we have a really good general idea of what our customer is going to be like,\" Kardashian told WWD. \"We are definitely prepared for the demand.\u2026I know they [Seed Beauty] do make a mass volume. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re making a small quantity and it\u2019s selling out.\" Hallelujah.\n\nKKW Beauty officially launches Wednesday, June 21, on kkwbeauty.com.\n\nMore on Kim Kardashian:\n\nNow, check out Kim Kardashian's style evolution:\n\nFollow Devon Abelman on Twitter and Instagram.", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/6916343ca33473dcfd6aac43/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6904c1f810c91f09f41c3298/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/690cc01e66ddff16cb311bd3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/68ff9a615d6b62c3d564441c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/68fbc7437b287a1dcff8e502/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6908db9e6df9c40528ad1e6b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/68c32805adb7df8523195669/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/68fa7f92e9c638caa44f0e80/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5947d1fd4343936458f479e6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/19121721_771889382987113_2800307973933498368_n.jpeg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/68ffc2fc17161b136b0dcc07/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/68f918f33483d028b7813ebf/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/691390c7f3aaf54e55f67920/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/690117fe232c4178c6e9eba8/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/624493d6b5d3d31ccdd63da0/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5947d1fd4343936458f479e6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/19121721_771889382987113_2800307973933498368_n.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Devon Abelman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/kim-kardashian-difference-between-kkw-beauty-kylie-cosmetics", "title": "Kim Kardashian Just Revealed the Difference Between KKW Beauty and Kylie Cosmetics", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Devon Abelman", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "With KKW Beauty launching this week, Kim Kardashian explains how her beauty brand differs from Kylie Cosmetics.", "id": "5947cb24db605a56d79a2568", "keywords": "kim kardashian,kkw beauty,kylie jenner,kylie cosmetics", "news_keywords": "kim kardashian,kkw beauty,kylie jenner,kylie cosmetics", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5947cb24db605a56d79a2568", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"With KKW Beauty launching this week, Kim Kardashian explains how her beauty brand differs from Kylie Cosmetics.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5947d1fd4343936458f479e6/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/19121721_771889382987113_2800307973933498368_n.jpeg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5947d1fd4343936458f479e6/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/19121721_771889382987113_2800307973933498368_n.jpeg\"}", "og": {"description": "Spoiler alert: They aren't in competition.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5947d1fd4343936458f479e6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/19121721_771889382987113_2800307973933498368_n.jpeg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Kim Kardashian Just Revealed the Difference Between KKW Beauty and Kylie Cosmetics", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/kim-kardashian-difference-between-kkw-beauty-kylie-cosmetics"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-06-19T13:52:53.385Z", "modified_time": "2017-06-19T13:52:53.385Z", "author": "Devon Abelman"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "Spoiler alert: They aren't in competition.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5947d1fd4343936458f479e6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/19121721_771889382987113_2800307973933498368_n.jpeg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Kim Kardashian Just Revealed the Difference Between KKW Beauty and Kylie Cosmetics"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5947d1fd4343936458f479e6/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/19121721_771889382987113_2800307973933498368_n.jpeg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497880373.385, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
