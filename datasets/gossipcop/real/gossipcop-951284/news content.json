They headed to the restaurant after spending the morning visiting Croke Park and Trinity College, where massive crowds were there to greet them. Lunch, then, was a moment for peace and quiet; the venue was closed to the public so that the royals could enjoy their meal in peace.\n\n\u201cThe booking was made some time ago, and they had pre-ordered their meals,\u201d manager Grace Davis told Vanity Fair. \u201cThey had the smoked salmon starter. Meghan had the hake for her main course; Harry had the lamb. They had planned to have dessert too, but said they were too full by the end of their meal. So they just had what we call our 3fe Dublin roasted coffee. They seemed to love it\u2014it was empty plates all around. They even shared a half-pint of Guinness, and Harry had a Coke.\u201d\n\nMeghan is a self-confessed foodie and loves to eat out. While a quick lunch on the go is usually the order of the day for royal tours, the prince wanted to treat Meghan to an authentic Dublin experience, to mark the end of what has been a very successful\u2014and enjoyable\u2014tour.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69138dc2108d96082627c8f5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691388cbb0b7e0bbf578f04e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ba93e3787834306acdc6688/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Meghan-Markle-Blue-Shirt.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6902272ce593df117190f65c/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68ff920fac05a478f30a076a/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6900e724719651cf92568024/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6900e51ced438c365eee89f9/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5baa7218b2ab083a47a5bf49/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Meghan-Markle-Black-Dress.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb4d4f4e5ae6a094d0019c5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Meghan-Markle-All-Green.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b45ecc7dd00b90bb2b15968/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/harry-meghan-ireland-day-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691749567922be8584aa2766/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62fe7ae3f9f2d6c81700a52c/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690cd8954962ddec3a078f19/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69123a9c394f434c95534e34/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b45ecc8dd00b90bb2b1596a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-harry-meghan-ireland-day-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690bcf4cd862d6f327955a94/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69137f7deea4fcf5c9461528/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6908b9ad88b4a7dfb6190d78/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b45ecc8dd00b90bb2b1596a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-harry-meghan-ireland-day-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Nicholl"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/harry-meghan-secret-romantic-lunch-dublin", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Were \u201cVery Happy Together\u201d at a Secret, Romantic Lunch in Dublin", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Katie Nicholl", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "\u201cIt was empty plates all around.
