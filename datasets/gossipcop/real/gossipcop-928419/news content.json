Cast: Amy Schumer, Michelle Williams, Busy Philipps, Naomi Campbell, Aidy Bryant, Emily Ratajkowski. 12A cert, 110 mins\n\nAmy Schumer doesn\u2019t need too many excuses to be funny, and she certainly doesn\u2019t need the trumped-up self-body-shaming of I Feel Pretty, her new vehicle as a producer and star. The film wants it both ways: to reject the unattainable hierarchies of the beauty industry, but also to ridicule a person who doesn\u2019t know her place within them.\n\nThe only means it can find to be funny is sabotaging its own message, which isn\u2019t a great starting point, let alone finishing point, for a body-positive comedy.\n\nRen\u00e9e (Schumer) is a minor employee at a scarily top-end New York cosmetics firm. She\u2019s as far from front-of-house as could be imagined, sifting through web orders in a dingy basement that's miles from the gleaming HQ uptown. And she hates the way she looks, trapped in a state of precarious mental health which can\u2019t be helped by her choice of employer.\n\nBrought to mind in a scene when she watches Big (1988) are the high-concept comedies of the 1980s. One of these might have decided to port Ren\u00e9e into someone else\u2019s physique \u2013 say, the lissom style princess played here by Michelle Williams \u2013 and watched them grapple with their change in fortunes.", "images":
