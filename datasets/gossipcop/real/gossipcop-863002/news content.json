{"url": "https://variety.com/2017/film/news/johnny-depp-trump-assassination-apology-1202477242/", "text": "Johnny Depp has issued an apology for a controversial comment about President Donald Trump, asking, \u201cWhen was the last time an actor assassinated a president?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt did not come out as intended, and I intended no malice. I was only trying to amuse, not to harm anyone,\u201d the actor said in a statement to People on Friday.\n\nDepp\u2019s joke, in reference to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln by John Wilkes Booth in 1865, was made during an appearance at the Glastonbury Festival. \u201cI want to qualify, I am not an actor. I lie for a living,\u201d he added at the U.K. music festival. \u201cHowever, it has been a while and maybe it is time.\u201d\n\nShortly after news broke of Depp\u2019s comments, the White House issued a statement strongly condemning the joke and calling on others in Hollywood to speak out.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cPresident Trump has condemned violence in all forms and it\u2019s sad that others like Johnny Depp have not followed his lead,\u201d the statement read. \u201cI hope that some of Mr. Depp\u2019s colleagues will speak out against this type of rhetoric as strongly as they would if his comments were directed to a Democrat elected official.\u201d\n\nDepp is only the latest celebrity to find himself in hot water over violent commentary aimed at Trump. Late last month, Kathy Griffin posed for a photo shoot in which she held up a bloody prop head that resembled Trump. The comedian has also apologized, and was dropped from her co-hosting gig at CNN\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve show.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/johnny-depp-donald-trump.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/johnny-depp-donald-trump.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Stedman", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/film/news/johnny-depp-trump-assassination-apology-1202477242/", "title": "Johnny Depp Apologizes for Donald Trump Assassination Joke", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Johnny Depp has issued an apology for a controversial comment about President Donald Trump.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Alex Stedman", "tags": "Donald Trump, Johnny Depp, sensitive", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Johnny Depp Apologizes for Donald Trump Assassination Joke", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/film/news/johnny-depp-trump-assassination-apology-1202477242/", "description": "Johnny Depp has issued an apology for a controversial comment about President Donald Trump.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/johnny-depp-donald-trump.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Johnny Depp Donald Trump"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-23T18:23:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-23T18:41:09+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Johnny Depp has issued an apology for a controversial comment about President Donald Trump.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@a_sted", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Johnny Depp Apologizes for Donald Trump Assassination Joke", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/johnny-depp-donald-trump.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498242201.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
