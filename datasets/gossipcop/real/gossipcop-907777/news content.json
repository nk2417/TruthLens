Equality in the workplace, 50/50 by 2020, these are messages that are getting out there now.\"\n\nLast week, Chalamet announced on Instagram that he donated his salary from the upcoming Woody Allen film A Rainy Day in New York to charity.\n\nThe money will go to Time's Up campaign, the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), and New York's LGBT Center. It followed criticism of his decision to work with Allen, who was accused of sexual assault by his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow.\n\nChalamet said he refrained from talking about the choice to work on Allen's movie due to contractual obligations, although a report has claimed these restrictions don't actually exist in the contract.\n\nFeatured Video For You", "images":
