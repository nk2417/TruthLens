{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturi_Naughton", "text": "American actress and singer\n\nMusical artist\n\nNaturi Cora Maria Naughton-Lewis (born May 20, 1984)[1] is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. Naughton is best known as one-third of the R&B group 3LW and for her acting roles in the films Fame and Notorious, playing rapper Lil' Kim in the latter film. Naughton was a series regular on the NBC series The Playboy Club as Bunny Brenda, starred in the first season of the Lifetime drama series The Client List as Kendra and starred in the Starz drama Power as Tasha St. Patrick, a role she reprised in the spin-off series Power Book II: Ghost. In 2022, she starred as Jill \u201cDa Thrill\u201d in the ABC series Queens.\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nNaughton was born and raised in East Orange, New Jersey,[1] the daughter of Brenda, a part-time paralegal, and Ezra Naughton, a retired accountant.[2] Her father is originally from St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands and her mother is from Raleigh, North Carolina.[3] Her musical talent emerged at the age of five years old, when she joined the choir at New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, New Jersey (the same church where Whitney Houston had performed in her youth). Naughton continued her musical studies at the Newark School of the Arts. She attended St. Joseph's Catholic school and Immaculate Conception High School in Montclair, New Jersey. Naughton has sung the national anthem at various events in New Jersey and attended Seton Hall University.[4]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\n3LW [ edit ]\n\nIn 1999, at age 15, Naughton joined Adrienne Bailon and Kiely Williams to form the group 3LW. Their first single, \"No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)\", was released in the fall of 2000. \"No More\" was a success and was followed by the second single, \"Playas Gon' Play\" in early 2001. The group's debut album, 3LW, was released on December 5, 2000. The album went platinum, selling 1.3 million copies in the U.S. alone.\n\n3LW returned in the summer of 2002 with the P. Diddy-produced single \"I Do (Wanna Get Close to You)\", featuring Loon. In August 2002, the group was set to release its newest LP, A Girl Can Mack, when Naughton announced that she was no longer a member of the trio. Naughton insisted that the other two girls and their management had forced her out.[5] The problems reached a breaking point after a heated argument with Williams, Bailon, and their manager, which allegedly involved Williams throwing a hot plate of KFC food at Naughton.[6] Following Naughton's departure, Bailon and Williams resumed as a duo for a short time, before Jessica Benson became Naughton's replacement.[7] The group has since disbanded. In May 2017, Naughton reunited with Bailon on the daytime talk show The Real,[8] while promoting the season premiere of Power.\n\nSolo work [ edit ]\n\nNaughton at H-E-B Holiday Parade 2009\n\nNaughton recorded five tracks for the Fame soundtrack, released on August 25, 2009.[9] The following month, Naughton scored her first solo chart entry ever with her cover of Fame peaking at No. 33 on the UK Singles Chart. The single also reached the Top 20 in Finland, Portugal and Norway.[10] In 2010, an extended play was released, titled Fame Presents Naturi Naughton as Denise: Didn't I Tell You?. The EP included both previously released and unreleased tracks.[11][12]\n\nDuring her February 2010 appearance on The Mo'Nique Show, Naughton expressed interest in recording a solo-debut album. She was believed to be working with music producer Full Force at the time. Naughton has since revealed that she is now focusing on her acting career, but has not ruled out an album. An ensemble of demos, including a duet with Lil' Kim, have been leaked to the internet in recent years. However, it is unknown whether or not they will be released on Naughton's debut album.\n\nActing [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2008, Naughton was cast to portray Grammy Award-winning rap artist Lil' Kim in Notorious, a biopic film about The Notorious B.I.G.[13] The film was released in January 2009 to mixed reviews[14] and went on to make over $43 million worldwide.[15] Lil' Kim has stated that she \"hated everything about that movie\" and would not have chosen Naughton to play her because they \"have nothing in common\".[16][17]\n\nNaughton was later cast as Denise, an aspiring singer, in the Lionsgate remake of the 1980 film of the same name Fame.[18] Filming took place in New York City and Los Angeles in November and December 2008. The film was released in September 2009 and opened No. 3 at the U.S. box office in its opening weekend despite negative reviews from critics.[19] It went on to make $77 million worldwide.\n\nIn August 2010, Naughton was announced to appear in an episode of the AMC drama television series Mad Men.[20] The episode, \"Hands and Knees\", which aired on September 26, 2010, saw Naughton portray the role of Toni Charles, a Playboy Bunny mistress to the character Lane Pryce.

The series premiered on April 8, 2012 to 2.79 million viewers[28] and mixed reviews from critics.

She won an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for the third season. Naughton reprised her role as Tasha in the spin-off series Power Book II: Ghost, which began airing in September 2020.\n\nOn March 8, 2021, it was announced that Naughton had joined the cast of American Broadcasting Company's music series Queens, alongside Brandy and Eve.[30][31][32][33] In May 2021, it was announced the show was being picked up for a full series,[34][35][36][37] followed by the first official trailer, released on May 18.[38] On October 1, 2021, the first promo single from Queens (\u201cNasty Girl\"), featuring Naughton alongside the cast: Brandy, Eve and Velazquez, was released.[39] A music video, directed by Tim Story, premiered on the same day.[40] This was followed on October 18, 2021, by another rap song from the Queens soundtrack, \u201cThe Introduction\u201d, which was co-written by Nas.[41] Queens debuted on October 19; although the series was cancelled after one season, reviews were largely positive.
