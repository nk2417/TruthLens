Andrew Cuomo, who has served two terms, for the Democratic nomination.\n\nNixon, 52 \u2014 who supports increased funding for New York public schools, abortion rights and the legalization of marijuana \u2014 is running on a progressive platform. If she wins the primary and then the election on Nov. 6, Nixon would be the first woman and openly gay person to hold the position.\n\nWhile it\u2019s still too soon to know the fate of Nixon\u2019s gubernatorial run, here\u2019s a look back at all the warm endorsements Nixon has received from her fellow Sex and the City alums.\n\nEverett\n\nSarah Jessica Parker\n\nSarah Jessica Parker, whose friendship with Nixon predates the beloved HBO series, revealed in April that she knew about Nixon\u2019s plans to run for office before the official announcement.\n\n\u201cShe shared with me that she was going to announce about a month before. I was incredibly excited and proud of her. I think she\u2019s already been good for the conversation,\u201d Parker, 53, told a large crowd gathered for a retrospective on her career at the 2018 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City.\n\nNew Line Cinema/Hbo/Village Roadshow/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cThis is what\u2019s exciting about primaries, right? People can inspire an incumbent to reconsider policy\u2026or just have a robust conversation,\u201d Parker added. \u201cShe\u2019s formidable. She\u2019s incredibly bright. She\u2019s really brave. She\u2019s excited about this race, and it\u2019s challenging. But, she seems enormously energized and I think it\u2019s good for us to have a competitor \u2014 it\u2019s always good. A challenger is good.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Cynthia Nixon Confirms She\u2019s Running for Governor: \u2018I Love New York, But Something Has to Change\u2019\n\nEarlier at the event, Parker admitted that while she \u201cdidn\u2019t [anticipate] that she would seek a gubernatorial seat,\u201d Nixon has \u201cbeen an activist her entire life.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s incredibly bright, she loves this city, she\u2019s been involved in conversations about policies that have been really important to her for many years: Education, public schools, housing\u2026the larger issues that are part of conversations that affect us here [in the city] and upstate as well,\u201d she added.\n\nShortly after Nixon announced her candidacy, Parker also penned a sweet note on Instagram, offering her pal support.\n\nDescribing Nixon as \u201ca mother, an activist, an advocate, a fighter, a NY\u2019er and a dear friend,\u201d Parker told Nixon, \u201cMy sister on and off screen, you have my love, support and vote.\u201d\n\nKim Cattrall\n\nDays after Nixon announced her candidacy in March, Kim Cattrall revealed that she supported her costar\u2019s decision.\n\nMATT CAMPBELL/AFP/Getty\n\nResponding to a Twitter user who asked for her opinions, the 61-year-old actress who played Samantha replied, \u201cI support & respect any former colleague\u2019s right to make their own career choices.\u201d\n\nKristin Davis\n\nMere minutes after Nixon announced her bid, Kristin Davis was ready to offer her friend a warm endorsement.\n\n\u201cI am so proud of @cynthiaNixon, no one cares more than she does about EVERY person getting a fair change and a good education. I know she would be an excellent Governor !\u201d wrote Davis, 53, who played Charlotte on the hit HBO series.\n\nDimitrios Kambouris/VF1/WireImage\n\nDavis then shared that she had already donated to Nixon\u2019s campaign, and urged her followers to do the same.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited to support someone I have know [sic] for 20 years to be one of the most intelligent and caring people in my life,\u201d Davis added.\n\nWillie Garson\n\nSupport for Nixon wasn\u2019t limited to her female costars!\n\nWillie Garson, 54 \u2014 who played Parker\u2019s friend Stanford Blatch \u2014 was also quick to endorse her.\n\n\u201cI cant think of anyone who\u2019s more prepared, more caring, more educated on the issues and more READY than @cynthiaenixon\u2026.please join her on this journey, together we can turn things around with candidates such as her,\u201d he wrote alongside a clip of her campaign video.", "images":
