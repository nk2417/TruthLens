It\u2019s just, you know, Broadway\u2019s hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve talked a lot about it and we kind of took a first round of meetings to explore that universe,\u201d McKenna added at Monday\u2019s Television Critics Association press tour. \u201cWe\u2019re busy figuring out this end of the TV chapter, but we are definitely intending to do a play.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just wanted the \u2018Likes\u2019 on Instagram,\u201d Bloom said. She got more than 11,000 for the effort, which our readers can see below.\n\n\u201cBathroom selfie with @abmck [McKenna] on this Galentines Day,\u201d Bloom\u2019s Instagram post read. \u201cWe\u2019re celebrating it by doing our first round of NYC meetings for the \u2018Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\u2019 Broadway musical. Coming to Broadway in probably 2150 because that\u2019s how Broadway works I think.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the post that accompanied that caption:\n\nEarlier during the TCA panel, Bloom and McKenna explained the odd-but-apparently-creative choice to recast Santino Fontana\u2019s role of Greg in favor of new star Skylar Astin.\n\n\u201cWhen Rachel and I were conceiving the show we had always sort of intended that Greg and Rebecca\u2019s romance would end sort of where it did,\u201d McKenna said.\n\nBut much like the show has continued to explore the character of Josh despite the end of his romance with Rebecca, McKenna and Bloom wanted to find new ways to incorporate Greg despite Fontana\u2019s departure at the beginning of Season 2.\n\n\u201cRachel and I had always been exploring bringing back that character and sort of trying to figure out a way to do it that suited our show,\u201d McKenna continued. \u201cSo now bringing the character of Greg back, he is part of our storytelling. It\u2019s a plot point in the story that the character is reimagined and so he\u2019s going to be played by a different actor, which is Skylar.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tony-Maglio.png?fit=53%2C58&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tony-Maglio.png?resize=150%2C150&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/5x4_082025_COVER_B.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/crazy-ex-girlfriend-review-101215.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/crazy-ex-girlfriend-review-101215.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tony Maglio", "Tv Editor", "Tony.Maglio Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/crazy-ex-girlfriend-broadway-musical-cw-rachel-bloom/", "title": "\u2018Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\u2019: We\u2019ve Got an Update on That Whole Broadway Musical Thing", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend': We've Got an Update on That Whole Broadway Musical Thing", "description": "TCA 2018: \"'Twas a bit premature on my part,\" Rachel Bloom admits of her exciting Instagram announcement", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/crazy-ex-girlfriend-broadway-musical-cw-rachel-bloom/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/crazy-ex-girlfriend-review-101215.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2018-08-06T18:14:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-06T23:47:08+00:00"}, "author": "Tony Maglio", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Tony Maglio", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "aline_brosh_mckenna, broadway, crazy-ex-girlfriend, rachel-bloom, santino-fontana, skylar_astin, tca, tca-2018, the_cw", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "culture, music, report-tca, report-from-tca, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533579283.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
