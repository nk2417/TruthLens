We blasted Cypress Hill. It was mid-\u201890s, late-\u201890s. We felt so baller.\u201d\n\nIn order to maintain her innocence, Barrymore spray painted things her ex wouldn\u2019t have expected onto his car.\n\n\u201cA lot of really horrible things that would not seem like me. It wasn\u2019t like, \u2018You screwed me over, you d**k.\u2019 It was like, \u2018Anarchy\u2019 and \u2018Black Flag,\u2019\u201d she noted. \u201cAnd then he called me crying like a little b**ch, and he said, \u2018You wouldn\u2019t have done this, would you have?\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Noooo.\u2019\u201d\n\nBarrymore added that she never admitted her act of rebellion to her ex, saying, \u201cIt was really gratifying and now he knows it\u2019s me\u2026I went with my girlfriend Justine, and we were young and we felt so cool driving up the Canyon in my Ford Bronco, blasting Cypress Hill. It was such a moment. It was worth the phone call I might get sometime soon.\u201d\n\nBarrymore also reflected on her one-of-a-kind childhood, and talked about meeting the late Princess Diana as a kid around the time E.T. came out.\n\n\u201cI remember it like it was yesterday. It was the most exciting moment for me to meet a real-life princess, the real life princess, the People\u2019s Princess,\u201d she recalled. \u201cDiana was and is and will always be the epitome of a woman that all little girls look up to. She was so kind and so nice and I have to say growing up with her as a princess was just such a good example.\u201d\n\nIn the photo of the encounter, director Steven Spielberg is carefully watching Barrymore as she meets with royalty.\n\n\u201cYou can see Steven [Spielberg]\u2019s really looking, wanting to make sure I didn\u2019t mess this up,\u201d Barrymore said of her godfather. \u201cHe was very paternal to me, and he was like, \u2018Well, your mom took you to Studio 54 last night so I want to make sure you don\u2019t mess up\u2019\u2026 -- and thank you, Mom, because it was so fun \u2013 \u2018I want to make sure you don\u2019t screw up this very royal, regal moment.\u2019\u201d\n\nBarrymore hopes to instill a similar sense of responsibility in her own children \u2013 daughters Frankie, 4, and Olive, 5.\n\n\u201cI really do want them to summer intern when they start asking for money and doing their own laundry and learning how to be self-preserving,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to have a hard knock life the way, you know, I certainly grew up in an unorthodox way, but there were also so many cool things to it too. It was a balance that took a real art to navigate, and they\u2019re not going to have any kind of life like that. So I\u2019m always trying to figure out what will be their harsh realities that will really motivate them to be empathic and know that it\u2019s important to take care of yourself and ours.\u201d\n\nKimmel then brought up that Barrymore had Madonna at her 12th birthday party, and the actress added that Billy Idol, Grace Jones, and Stephen Pearcy from the band Ratt were also there.\n\n\u201cIt was so cool,\u201d she admitted. \u201cMy kids are going to miss out on fun things like that.\u201d\n\nFor more from Barrymore, watch the clip below:\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2019-10/jwpww.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-03/brown_vidpic_032918_1280_0.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/drew-barrymore-youtube.jpg?h=827f73f4", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-05/sarah-paulson-drew-barrymore-getty_0.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/drew-barrymore-youtube.jpg?h=827f73f4&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-03/drew_barrymore_gettyimages-936777346.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/drew-barrymore-youtube.jpg?h=827f73f4", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/drew-barrymore-recalls-spray-painting-her-ex-boyfriends-car-he-called-me-crying-104749", "title": "Drew Barrymore Recalls Spray Painting Her Ex-Boyfriend\u2019s Car: \u2018He Called Me Crying\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/drew-barrymore-youtube.jpg?h=827f73f4", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The actress also opens up about meeting \u2018real-life' Princess Diana.", "title": "Drew Barrymore Recalls Spray Painting Her Ex-Boyfriend\u2019s Car: \u2018He Called Me Crying\u2019", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/drew-barrymore-recalls-spray-painting-her-ex-boyfriends-car-he-called-me-crying-104749", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The actress also opens up about meeting \u2018real-life' Princess Diana.", "twitter": {"description": "The actress also opens up about meeting \u2018real-life' Princess Diana.", "title": "Drew Barrymore Recalls Spray Painting Her Ex-Boyfriend\u2019s Car: \u2018He Called Me Crying\u2019", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/drew-barrymore-recalls-spray-painting-her-ex-boyfriends-car-he-called-me-crying-104749", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/drew-barrymore-youtube.jpg?h=827f73f4", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Drew Barrymore Recalls Spray Painting Her Ex-Boyfriend\u2019s Car: \u2018He Called Me Crying\u2019 | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Drew Barrymore, Princess Diana, Madonna, Jimmy Kimmel", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
