Using his talents for both, the English prestidigitator pulled off a slow-burn magic trick that wowed the judges, and has to be seen to be believed.\n\nWhile the amazing illusion took a while to ramp up, the incredible conclusion was enough to make all the judges believe that magic might just be real, and London got four yes votes to continue on.\n\nThere have been quite a few magicians auditioning this season, but there seems to be even more clowns coming out of the woodwork to show off their talents. From funny clowns to sad clowns to goofy clowns to downright disturbing clowns -- the last thing Simon Cowell wanted to see on Tuesday was another one.\n\nBut Bello Nock is not your normal clown. While he's got the bizarre make-up and over-the-top costume, this particular clown is a wild and crazy daredevil who showed what set him apart from other jesters by climbing to the top of a 30-foot-tall pole in a death-defying stunt that terrified the judges and won over the crowd.\n\nWhile Nock won over most of the judges, Cowell was not as impressed and voted no. In an effort to change his mind, the daredevil made a bold promise to make his next stunt even crazier -- he said he'd be willing to get shot out of a cannon over a helicopter. The possibility seemed to impress Cowell, and he ended up switching his vote to a yes, sending Nock to the next round.\n\nIn true AGT form, the show saved the most emotional performance for last, with a 13-year-old singer named Evie Clair, whose heartbreaking story brought the audience to tears.\n\nClair comes from the small town of Florence, Arizona, where her dad works at one of the local prisons. A year ago, her father was diagnosed with stage-4 colon cancer, and given a five percent chance of survival.\n\n\"He still continued working and supporting our family,\" Clair recalled, as tears rolled down her face. \"So tonight I'm here to sing for him.\"\n\nThe AGT hopeful delivered a beautiful cover of Christina Perri's \"Arms,\" which is the song she sings to her dad whenever he's having a tough time during his battle with cancer.\n\n\"I sing him this song to help him feel better, and just to give him comfort and strength to continue fighting,\" Clair explained.\n\nIt was one of the most emotional AGT auditions we've seen this season, and the raw, heartfelt performance earned Clair a standing ovation and the votes she needed to move on to the next round.\n\nThis season is shaping up to be one of the most amazing AGTs in years.
