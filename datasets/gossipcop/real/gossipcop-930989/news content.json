We understand criticizing a famous artist is a good way to draw attention to those goals\u2014and in this case, it is unjust and off-target.\n\n\u201cWe fully support the rights of women to be empowered to make their own choices. Time\u2019s Up has neglected to speak with any of the women who welcome R. Kelly\u2019s support, and it has rushed to judgment without the facts. Soon it will become clear Mr. Kelly is the target of a greedy, conscious and malicious conspiracy to demean him, his family and the women with whom he spends his time.\n\n\u201cKelly\u2019s music is a part of American and African-American culture that should never\u2014and will never\u2014be silenced. Since America was born, black men and women have been lynched for having sex or for being accused of it. We will vigorously resist this attempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u2013Thanks for listening. R. Kelly management.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, WOC wrote that, \u201cfor too long, our community has ignored our pain. The pain we bear is a burden that too many women of color have had to bear for centuries. The wounds run deep,\u201d followed by the announcement that Time\u2019s Up will be joining the existing online campaign #MuteRKelly. It also called upon RCA Records, Spotify, Apple Music, Ticketmaster and the Greensboro Coliseum in North Carolina, where Kelly is scheduled to perform in May, to \u201cjoin us and insist on safety and dignity for women of all kinds.\u201d The organization\u2019s statement reads:\n\nRCA Records \u2013 The venerable music label currently produces and distributes R. Kelly\u2019s music;\n\n\u2022 Ticketmaster \u2013 The popular ticketing system is currently issuing tickets for R. Kelly\u2019s show on May 11;\n\n\u2022 Spotify and Apple Music \u2013 The popular streaming platforms currently monetizing R. Kelly\u2019s music;\n\n\u2022 Greensboro Coliseum Complex \u2013 The venue is currently hosting an R. Kelly concert on May 11.\n\nKelly has a long history of alleged misconduct with underaged women, including an annulled marriage to singer Aaliyah when she was 15; a long trial centering around a video allegedly depicting him having sex with an underaged women for which he was ultimately acquitted; and multiple accusations in recent months that he is running an \u201cabusive sex cult\u201d and essentially imprisoning women in his homes in Atlanta and Chicago. Kelly has maintained his innocence amid all of the allegations.\n\nEarlier this month, Kelly\u2019s entertainment attorney, Linda Mensch; his publicist, Trevian Kutti; and his executive assistant, Diana Copeland, all confirmed that they had resigned.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/r-kelly2.png?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/r-kelly2.png?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jem Aswad", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/music/news/r-kelly-responds-to-times-up-campaign-singer-is-target-of-greedy-conscious-and-malicious-conspiracy-1202792401/", "title": "R.
