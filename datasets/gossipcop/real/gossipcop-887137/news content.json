They should be able to flirt however they want with whomever they want.\u201d\n\nDespite her concession that it shouldn\u2019t be the duty of women \u201cto police our own behavior,\u201d the suggestion that her strategies would be helpful in staving off sexual predators enraged many people on social media, including Gabrielle Union, Emily Ratajkowski and Patricia Arquette, who all posted that dressing conservatively is not effective; many also accused Bialik of victim-blaming.\n\nReminder. I got raped at work at a Payless shoe store. I had on a long tunic & leggings so miss me w/ \u201cdress modestly\u201d shit. \u2014 Gabrielle Union (@itsgabrielleu) October 15, 2017\n\n.@missmayim I have to say I was dressed non provocatively at 12 walking home from school when men masturbated at me. It\u2019s not the clothes. \u2014 Patricia Arquette (@PattyArquette) October 14, 2017\n\nSo @missmayim \u201cadvice\u201d is: I was never pretty & never tried to be & ladies, take note if you don\u2019t want to be harassed? This isn\u2019t feminism pic.twitter.com/0Rrx6jrE5K \u2014 Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) October 15, 2017\n\nOthers criticized the Times as an institution for giving a platform to \u201cdangerous\u201d opinions. \u201cMayim Bialik\u2019s piece is part of the problem w/ the myth of journalistic objectivity, which suggests even dangerous opinions deserve platform,\u201d wrote Jamilah Lemieux, a culture critic and editor.\n\nMayim Bialik\u2019s piece is part of the problem w/ the myth of journalistic objectivity, which suggests even dangerous opinions deserve platform \u2014 Jamilah Lemieux (@JamilahLemieux) October 15, 2017\n\nAnother repeated critique of Bialik\u2019s piece is that her focus on not being a \u201cperfect 10\u201d in Hollywood and the ensuing decision to focus more on \u201cwhat was inside my brain than what was inside my bra\u201d was relevant to the discussion of sexual assault.\n\nThe schadenfruede that Mayim Bialik seems to have over the fact that she thinks that only pretty girls are sexually assaulted is gross \u2014 Ijeoma Oluo (@IjeomaOluo) October 15, 2017\n\nBialik has previously come under fire for criticizing women for dressing provocatively; in 2014 she wrote a piece for Kveller about a billboard featuring Ariana Grande in which she lamented that \u201cwomen are expected to be sexy and sexually available no matter what we do in society.\u201d\n\nMayim Bialik\u2019s trash NYT op-ed shouldn\u2019t be a surprise if you remember this pic.twitter.com/s6QeSIfaKe \u2014 Ira Madison III (@ira) October 14, 2017\n\nThe actress\u2019 comments on how women present themselves and the correlation to sexual harassment at the hands of men comes one week after designer Donna Karan suggested that women may be \u201casking for it\u201d by dressing provocatively. Karan has since apologized multiple times for her comments.\n\nOn Sunday evening, Bialik wrote that critics of the piece had \u201ctaken my words out of the context of the Hollywood machine and twisted them to imply that God forbid I would blame a woman for her assault.\u201d\n\nBeing told my @NYTimes piece resonated w/ so many. Also see some have taken my words out of the context of the Hollywood machine.
