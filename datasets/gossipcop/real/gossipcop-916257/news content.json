How do u fake marital problems? Makes absolutely no sense,\u201d Wilkinson wrote. \u201c2. Yes we are having issues. 3. My job has been reality tv for 13 years. 4. My show was a comedy and light hearted [until] sad times happened then we had to change my show from comedy to drama. Not what I wanted but was a part of my journey and story.\u201d\n\nKendra added three more points, noting that they are trying to overcome \u201cthese issues,\u201d which her family, friends and producers all know about.\n\n\u201cMy job is reality TV and I love my job unfortunately these issues at home are affecting my decisions [because] the last thing I want to do is hurt Hank,\u201d Kendra wrote. \u201cI hope to get back to the fun Kendra you all know. That\u2019s all I want [and] aim for. I hate drama!!! Thank you all for your support and understanding me at this time. I\u2019ve been in a lot of therapy lately n hope all gets resolved for me, Hank, kids and even for TV.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old Kendra gained fame after starring in E!\u2019s The Girls Next Door as one of Playboy founder Hugh Hefner\u2019s three girlfriends. In 2009, she married Baskett and the couple is featured on WE tv\u2019s Kendra on Top.
