The Academy has moved away from the mainstream over the last few years, awarding Best Picture to the low-budget \u201cMoonlight\u201d followed by the fantasy film \u201cThe Shape of Water,\u201d which bodes well for an eclectic group of contenders. But this year the studios are back in the race, led by Warner Bros.\u2019 redo \u201cA Star is Born\u201d and Universal\u2019s \u201cGreen Book.\u201d\n\nWhile the first quarter of 2018 quietly launched a handful of potential Oscar players, the record-breaking \u201cBlack Panther\u201d re-entered the conversation, as \u201cGet Out\u201d did last year, and rode its critical and commercial success all the way to seven Oscar nominations; Spike Lee\u2019s Cannes hit \u201cBlackKklansman\u201d landed six including Best Director, which could make him the first black filmmaker to win that category.\n\nEvery year, the majority of the year\u2019s biggest Oscar contenders debut in the fall. Academy Award winners Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, Barry Jenkins, and Damien Chazelle all dropped new projects on the festival circuit, along with Peter Farrelly, Adam McKay, Yorgos Lanthimos, Pawel Pawlikowski, Bradley Cooper, and more.\n\nClick the individual links below for Anne Thompson\u2019s developing Oscar predictions in each category.\n\nBest Picture\n\nBest Director\n\nBest Actress\n\nBest Actor\n\nBest Supporting Actress\n\nBest Supporting Actor\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay\n\nBest Original Screenplay\n\nBest Animated Feature\n\nBest Animated Short\n\nBest Cinematography\n\nBest Costume Design\n\nBest Documentary Feature\n\nBest Documentary Short\n\nBest Editing\n\nBest Foreign Language Feature\n\nBest Live Action Short\n\nBest Makeup and Hairstyling\n\nBest Production Design\n\nBest Original Score\n\nBest Original Song\n\nBest Sound Editing\n\nBest Sound Mixing\n\nBest Visual Effects", "images": ["https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Still-2-A-POET-UN-POETA_credit-Ocultimo-Juan-Sarmiento-G._.jpeg?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TNB_05859_R-H-2024-1.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Warner-Bros.-Discovery.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/P1032V65.jpg?w=2000&h=1333&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_9360960cr.jpg?w=3000&h=1687&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ANT_STILL2_FRANCISCO_PRONER.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1828-e1763583492953.jpeg?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/anaconda.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thoughts-and-prayers-hbo.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/working-girl.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Zack-Sharf.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_9360960cr.jpg?w=650", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple_TV_Your_Friends_and_Neighbors_key_art_graphic_header_16_9_show_home.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/P10XH2W.jpg?w=2000&h=1333&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-01-at-8.32.46\u202fPM.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_1828-e1763583492953.jpeg?w=2943&h=1918&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2233861423.jpg?w=3000&h=2537&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Eli-Feingold-e1763691944397.jpeg?resize=232,175", "https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/dish-vs-espn-sling-passes.png?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/251116B_0046.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_9360960cr.jpg?w=650", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zack Sharf"], "canonical_link": "https://www.indiewire.com/awards/industry/oscar-predictions-2019-academy-awards-nominations-1201962333/", "title": "2019 Oscar Predictions: 91st Academy Awards", "meta_data": {"description": "Academy Award winners Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, Damien Chazelle and Barry Jenkins are all back in the running for Oscars this awards season.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400654071", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Zack Sharf", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "2019 Oscar Predictions: 91st Academy Awards", "url": "https://www.indiewire.com/awards/industry/oscar-predictions-2019-academy-awards-nominations-1201962333/", "description": "Academy Award winners Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n, Damien Chazelle and Barry Jenkins are all back in the running for Oscars this awards season.", "site_name": "IndieWire", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_9360960cr.jpg?w=650", "width": 650, "height": 433, "alt": "No Merchandising.
