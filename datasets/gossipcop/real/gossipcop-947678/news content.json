I refuse for anyone to spread the idea that I lack the integrity to choose my own relationships. Only a man aka Brendan Tighe would come up with a crazy story like that,\u201d Johansson said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nWhile appearing on NBC\u2019s Megyn Kelly Today on Wednesday, Tighe said that while serving as a member of Cruise\u2019s Scientology security unit, he came across reports of women who auditioned to be in a relationship with the actor, one of whom was Johansson. Tighe explained that he saw the reports after they were accidentally sent to his printer and that he recalled only Johansson\u2019s name because hers was the only one he recognized.\n\n\u201cAnother actress, Erika Christensen, had to disconnect from Scarlett Johansson because it didn\u2019t go well. That was in that report,\u201d Tighe said.\n\nThe Church of Scientology also denied Tighe\u2019s claims regarding his role with Cruise.\n\nKarin Pouw, from the Church of Scientology International, told Kelly, \u201cBrendan Tighe was a Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization security guard/night watchman from 2002 to 2009. The \u2018access\u2019 he boasts of having was largely limited to viewing security cameras from a guard booth. He was removed from that position for dereliction of duty.\u201d\n\nTighe\u2019s accusation surrounding Johansson and Cruise is not the first time an alleged dating process for the actor has been rumored. According to a Vanity Fair article published in 2012, Scientology members underwent an audition process to see if they were a suitable match for Cruise. Actress Nazanin Boniadi was reportedly selected and was in a relationship with the actor from November 2004 to January 2005.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/scarlett_johansson_and_tom_cruise_-_split-getty-h_2018_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/scarlett_johansson_and_tom_cruise_-_split-getty-h_2018_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lexy Perez", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/scarlett-johansson-denies-demeaning-claim-she-auditioned-date-tom-cruise-1123768/", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Denies \u201cDemeaning\u201d Claim She Auditioned to Date Tom Cruise", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Scarlett Johansson is fighting back against a claim that she auditioned to date Tom Cruise following his split from Nicole Kidman.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Lexy Perez", "tags": "Scarlett Johansson, Scientology, Tom Cruise", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Denies \u201cDemeaning\u201d Claim She Auditioned to Date Tom Cruise", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/scarlett-johansson-denies-demeaning-claim-she-auditioned-date-tom-cruise-1123768/", "description": "Scarlett Johansson is fighting back against a claim that she auditioned to date Tom Cruise following his split from Nicole Kidman.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/scarlett_johansson_and_tom_cruise_-_split-getty-h_2018_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "Scarlett Johansson Denies \"Demeaning\" Claim She Auditioned Date Tom Cruise"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-27T15:11:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-28T17:34:05+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scarlett Johansson is fighting back against a claim that she auditioned to date Tom Cruise following his split from Nicole Kidman.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Denies \u201cDemeaning\u201d Claim She Auditioned to Date Tom Cruise", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/scarlett_johansson_and_tom_cruise_-_split-getty-h_2018_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530112297.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
