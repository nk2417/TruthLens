It\u2019s so challenging to create inside products but every time you stimulate your skin like this, it\u2019s there. Plus, the use of the warm cloth helps attach dead skin cells so it gives you great exfoliation. Just place the towel over your face and press. When you take it away, you\u2019ll see what glowing, flushing skin looks like and you can really see a lift. The blood also disperses which will provide you with a more even skin tone.\" I hate to head outside without a bit of concealer on at least, but I skipped makeup all day after this step.", "images": ["https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d68e2ddc49f6065953daf57eac5b849a.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/b3658fb2d9482c50df8996241fb2b67d.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/9aa89696be7da8b249e2ee2622a111e9.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/1ce585852b9e9a8cba36762b911e0f5f.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/cda4774d79df76d9c5ab2dfba3784155.png", "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/bef/0,212,3001,1576/x,80/2066092/image.jpg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/90e3b0501ff143bd058ecb3f754a4430.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/c5a8ae3dd50e6ebe17044593c2c7ee0c.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/6a9d712b4b1480df334054a94146cc34.png"], "top_img": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/bef/0,212,3001,1576/x,80/2066092/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacqueline Kilikita", "Karina Hoshikawa", "Venus Wong", "Varsha Patel", "Mica Ricketts", "Vanese Maddix", "Lucy Abbersteen", "Goop Skincare Products Review - Gwyneth Paltrow"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/goop-skincare-products-review", "title": "I Really Wanted To Hate Goop \u2013 But The Skincare Made Me Glow", "meta_data": {"title": "Goop Skincare Products Review - Gwyneth Paltrow", "description": "From jade vaginal eggs to dietary supplements, there's a reason why most of us are sceptical of Goop.
