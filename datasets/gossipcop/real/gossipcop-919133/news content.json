The actress and professional dancer, who is normally a very bright blonde, just completely changed up her look by dyeing her hair a rich copper red color. Hough penned a long caption explaining her hair decision and how she feels so much more comfortable in her own skin with her new hue. \"I have never felt more like ME than I do right now!!\" Hough wrote. \"I have always felt like a redhead my whole life, even to the point that I've thought that my future daughter would 100 [percent] be a redhead!\" She continued, \"I've seriously talked about doing this for [six] years, ask anyone who knows me...and now that I'm on this new journey, exploring and finding out who I truly am, I said screw it! I feel more feminine and alive and I love it! \" There's nothing like a good hair transformation to shake up your entire life.\n\nFor anyone who follows Hough on social media, it should come as no surprise that she went to Nine Zero One in Los Angeles, the salon co-owned by her hairstylist and close friend, Riawna Capri (who we gave the title of \"coolest hair on Instagram\" back in 2014 when the social media platform was still fairly new). Her colorist was Amber Maynard, who also works with Demi Lovato and Hillary Duff. Maynard used Joico LumiShine hair color to get her perfect red, and is calling the concoction a Femme Fatale Ruby Red Valentine Formula. If you're dying to copy the dye job exactly, Capri details the exact recipe, from base color to ends, on her Instagram.\n\nHough got inspired by Jessica Chastain's dark strawberry hue, which, according to a press release, took nine hours to achieve \u2014 even though Hough had just had a bleach and tone before going red.\n\nTake a peek at the multihyphenate's transformation in the Instagram post below:", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/6903775a3babbc8af2b04ebb/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/690368aa3babbc8af2b04eb4/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a8c5247c14da470bc492a11/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/julianne-hough.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/690cc01e66ddff16cb311bd3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/691b72e70532ad6d243613c5/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/69173bd3319f5515ee34ac5e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/691cc1750034d2996f8412d6/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6902155618beee78d5a38e4a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6917a54a10079be3a81be51f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a85a336c14da470bc492960/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/julianne-hough-dyes-hair-red.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5968bf0b49909e6578a0ab68/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/julianne.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5771aef33b5256713da4c54f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/beauty-trends-blogs-daily-beauty-reporter-2016-05-04-julianne-hough-hair.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/691390c7f3aaf54e55f67920/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5877e25bbe86c4464b612eca/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/00000000_XX_9274_5A6BAD412BFCF48B42B4F959460C08EE-Edit%252011-22.JPG", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a8c5247c14da470bc492a11/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/julianne-hough.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melissa Minton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/julianne-hough-dyes-hair-red", "title": "Julianne Hough Dyes Hair Red After Being Blonde for Years", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Melissa Minton", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Julianne Hough dyed her hair from platinum blonde to copper red at Nine Zero Salon in Los Angeles and took to Instagram to show off her new look.", "id": "5a85a25c966c5a7bcada41ca", "keywords": "snd,julianne hough,red hair,hair transformation,nine zero one", "news_keywords": "snd,julianne hough,red hair,hair transformation,nine zero one", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a85a25c966c5a7bcada41ca", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Julianne Hough dyed her hair from platinum blonde to copper red at Nine Zero Salon in Los Angeles and took to Instagram to show off her new look.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5a85a336c14da470bc492960/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/julianne-hough-dyes-hair-red.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5a85a336c14da470bc492960/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/julianne-hough-dyes-hair-red.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Beauty takes time", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a8c5247c14da470bc492a11/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/julianne-hough.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Julianne Hough's Hair-Color Transformation Into a Redhead Took a Whopping NINE Hours", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/julianne-hough-dyes-hair-red"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-02-15T17:47:47.859Z", "modified_time": "2018-02-20T17:09:00.000Z", "author": "Melissa Minton"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "Beauty takes time", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a8c5247c14da470bc492a11/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/julianne-hough.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Julianne Hough's Hair-Color Transformation Into a Redhead Took a Whopping NINE Hours"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a8c5247c14da470bc492a11/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/julianne-hough.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518716867.859, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
