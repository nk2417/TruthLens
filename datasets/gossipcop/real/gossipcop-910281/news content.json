Kudos have also gone to Coogler\u2019s long-running collaborators, including including production designer Hannah Beachler, editor Michael P. Shawver, and newly minted Oscar nominated cinematographer Rachel Morrison for helping turn Wakanda into a living, breathing world.\n\nBut the biggest praise has gone to the film\u2019s supporting cast, with critics hailing Michael B. Jordan\u2019s performance as Erik Killmonger as the latest addition to Marvel\u2019s recent streak of intriguing villains after years of forgettable foes. The women of Wakanda have also been praised as show-stealers, with breakout star Letitia Wright standing out as Black Panther\u2019s excitable tech wunderkind sister Shuri.\n\n\u201c\u2018Black Panther\u2019 boasts a lot of black talent on both sides of the camera, which is unusual enough for a big studio movie, but this is also one of the most Africa-centric films Hollywood has ever produced,\u201d wrote TheWrap\u2019s Alonso Duralde. \u201cAmerican viewers don\u2019t get much of a look at one of the planet\u2019s most gorgeous and populous continents, so it\u2019s exciting to see the wildly popular Marvel movies take us there.\u201d\n\nRead more of \u201cBlack Panther\u201d\u2018s rave reviews below:\n\nKenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times\n\n\u201cWith dialogue that deftly explores serious questions, such as how much if anything do wealthy countries owe the poor and oppressed of the world, \u2018Black Panther\u2019 draws energy from Coogler\u2019s sense of excitement at all he\u2019s attempting. The result is a superhero movie that\u2019s worth seeing twice, and that is a rare sighting indeed.\u201d\n\nDavid Ehrlich, IndieWire\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to watch a film of this size casually reckon with (or even merely allude to the existence of) the complex dynamic between Africans and their extended diaspora. The villain speaks in the language of slaves and oppressors, the hero wants to rewrite those roles from scratch, and the friction between their differing ideas of power is manifest through character-driven conflict that feels rooted to the ground they\u2019re fighting over. It doesn\u2019t matter that you know who wins in the end, or that the movie seldom deviates from its staid \u2018Macbeth\u2019 structure, because being Black Panther and becoming Black Panther are two very different things.\u201d\n\nJamie Broadnax, Black Girl Nerds\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s afro-futuristic and Blackity-black as hell. It\u2019s everything I\u2019ve ever desired in a live-action version of this popular superhero and yet so much more. Quite frankly, the experience is indescribable. I left the theater wanting to see this movie at least 10 more times. I already know that \u201cBlack Panther\u201d\u2018s weight in gold at the box office will be in repeat viewings, because we just won\u2019t want this cinematic experience to end.\u201d\n\nTim Grierson, Screen International\n\n\u201cEven if \u201cBlack Panther\u201c\u2018s story is a little plodding, Coogler and his creative team have crafted an absorbing, specific world for the viewer to explore. Oscar-nominated cinematographer Rachel Morrison and production designer Hannah Beachler envision a Wakanda that, to the rest of the world, looks like just another desolate, impoverished African country \u2014 only to reveal that the seemingly inconsequential nation is actually incredibly technologically advanced thanks to a treasure trove of a rare metal that powers its hidden cities and sophisticated spacecraft. Combined with Ludwig G\u00f6ransson\u2019s propulsive, rhythmic score, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d has a look and feel that separate it from other MCU movies, placing the film in its own unique universe.\u201d\n\nManohla Dargis, New York Times\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to the movie\u2019s politics and myth-building that he is surrounded by a phalanx of women, among them a battalion of women warriors called the Dora Milaje. These aren\u2019t moviedom\u2019s irritatingly token strong chicks, the tough babes with sizable biceps and skills but no real roles. For all his father issues, T\u2019Challa is enveloped by women who cushion him in maternal, military, sisterly and scientific support. A female general (Danai Gurira) stands by his side; his baby sister (a vivacious Letitia Wright) provides gadgets and withering asides \u00e0 la Bond\u2019s gadget guy. Angela Bassett swans in as the royal mother, while Lupita Nyong\u2019o, as a spy, makes the case for her own spinoff.\u201d\n\nPeter Travers, Rolling Stone\n\n\u201cUnlike other Marvel superheroes, T\u2019Challa is a king, a real-life royal with a burden of responsibility. Does he keep Wakanda safe by hiding its technological advances or share them with volatile intruders, who are eager to weaponize resources meant to strengthen and heal? In \u201cGet Out,\u201d Jordan Peele satirized white appropriation of black culture. Here, Coogler makes black identity invincible, but avoids simplification by turning Wakanda into a society of different tribes, each with its own customs, goals and political agendas that reflect a conflicted world very much like our own.\u201d\n\n", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeremy-Fuster.png?resize=150%2C150&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/5x4_082025_COVER_B.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeremy-Fuster.png?fit=53%2C58&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPantherJordanBoseman.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/BlackPantherJordanBoseman.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeremy Fuster", "Film Reporter", "Joined Thewrap In", "Covers Box Office", "Labor News.
