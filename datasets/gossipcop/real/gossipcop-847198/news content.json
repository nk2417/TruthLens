It comes after the 57 year-old took part in a Reddit Q&A called Ask Me Anything, last week.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nOne user enquired: \"A while ago, Michael Douglas claimed you had terminal cancer. What was the story behind that?\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 5 Images Actor Val Kilmer seems to have confirmed he was suffering with cancer (Image: Getty)\n\nResponding, Val said: \"He was probably trying to help me cause press probably asked where I was these days, and I did have a healing of cancer, but my tongue is still swollen altho healing all the time (sic).\n\n\"Because I don\u2019t sound my normal self yet people think I may still be under the weather.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nHis turn of phrase - \"a healing of cancer\" - is likely related to Scientology, of which he's a subscriber. The church believes that poor health can be healed through prayer because it's essentially a mental error.\n\nThe Mirror have contacted a representative for Val Kilmer, but are yet to receive a response.\n\n5 View 5 Images The actor, 57, has been the subject of rumours for some time (Image: Instagram/valkilmerofficial) 5 View 5 Images Kilmer is shown in the movie Batman Forever\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nHis apparent admission comes just months after he denied having any form of cancer.\n\nIn a lengthy post to Facebook which surfaced after fellow star Michael Douglas implied he'd been diagnosed, he said: \"I love Michael Douglas but he is misinformed.\n\n\"The last time I spoke to him was almost two years ago, when I asked him for a referral for a specialist to get a diagnosis for a lump in my throat, which prevented me from continuing a tour of my play CITIZEN TWAIN.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\"I ended up using a team at UCLA and have no cancer whatsoever. I still have a swollen tongue and am rehabbing steadily.\"\n\nView 5 Images Kilmer and Tom Cruise face off in Top Gun\n\n\"Some fans have mistakenly thought my silence about my personal issues meant that somehow I wasn't being responsible to my health, because of my reliance on prayer and Love. Nothing could be further from the truth. Altho I am very grateful for all the support from around the world, when people found out I had a physical challenge.\"(sic)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\u201cNothing could be further from the truth. Altho I am very grateful for all the support from around the world, when people found out I had a physical challenge.\n\n\"I hope this puts to rest any further concerns about my health by publications that have no respect for the truth. Whatever led Michael Douglas to speculate about my health, he's a loving and devoted friend to a privileged group of talent people around the world, and I'm sure he meant no harm.\u201d\n\nDouglas himself is a cancer survivor having recovered from stage four oral cancer in 2013.", "images": ["https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article9177748.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Val-Kilmer.jpg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/ipso.svg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/trust-project.svg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/nav-web-static/release-v41-14493b7c888038a7d89b99cb3a7937c2b71eaebe/public/logo-reach.png", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article7628769.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Val-Kilmer-is-shown-as-he-portrays-Batman-in-Batman-Forever.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article9161434.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/topgun_article_story_large.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article5079244.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Val-Kilmer.jpg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/assets/mirror/logos/masthead-mirror-default.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article9244365.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Val-Kilmer.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article9244365.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Val-Kilmer.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article9244365.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Val-Kilmer.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Draper", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/i-healing-cancer-val-kilmer-10333698", "title": "\"I did have a healing of cancer\": Val Kilmer FINALLY admits to battling disease", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"page_id": 6149699161, "app_id": 123792601022133, "pages": 1814357575554395}, "description": "The 57 year-old made the admission in a Reddit chat", "author": "James Draper", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "Googlebot-News": "noarchive", "referrer": "unsafe-URL", "keywords": "Michael Douglas, Val Kilmer, Michael Douglas cancer, Cancer", "news_keywords": "Michael Douglas, Val Kilmer, Michael Douglas cancer, Cancer", "allowTaboolaDeepDive": "true", "vf": {"00000000-0000-4000-8000-67e599051dc3": "mirror-prod-10333698"}, "og": {"title": "Val Kilmer admits he's fought cancer", "description": "The 57 year-old made the admission in a Reddit chat", "url": "http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/i-healing-cancer-val-kilmer-10333698", "site_name": "Daily Mirror", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article9244365.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Val-Kilmer.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-01T12:34:05Z", "modified_time": "2017-05-01T12:59:46Z", "author": "James Draper", "section": "Celebrity News", "tag": "Cancer"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@DailyMirror", "creator": "@DailyMirror", "title": "\"I did have a healing of cancer\": Val Kilmer FINALLY admits to battling disease - The Mirror", "description": "The 57 year-old made the admission in a Reddit chat", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article9244365.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Val-Kilmer.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493642045.0, "source": "https://www.mirror.co.uk", "summary": ""}
