She won big at the 24th annual awards on Sunday night in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m crying. [This] means a lot to me,\u201d Kidman said as she took the stage to accept the award. \u201cI\u2019ve been working since I was 14 years old\u2026. I\u2019m incredibly nervous because this is reality colliding with fantasy right now. I was working until 1 a.m., which is a fantastic blessing last night, but I have the flu and I\u2019m playing a pretty out-there, raw character right now so I\u2019ve had a little trouble shedding it. But I\u2019m here and I\u2019m incredibly grateful. To receive this at this stage of my life is extraordinary, and at this time in the industry when these things are going on and for this role.\u201d\n\nKidman went on to tip her hat to her fellow Big Little Lies nominees, as well as Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon. \u201cI revere you, I\u2019ve watched you, and I\u2019ve learned from you,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s others,\u201d she added, before listing names including Meryl Streep, Jane Fonda, and Judi Dench. \u201cI want to thank you all for your trailblazing performances you\u2019ve given over your career and how wonderful it is that our careers today can go beyond 40 years ago. Twenty years ago, we were pretty washed up by this stage in our lives. That\u2019s not the case now. We have proven, and these actresses and so many more are proving that we are potent and powerful and viable.\u201d\n\nShe concluded by imploring writers, directors, studios, and financiers to continue to tell stories about women \u2014 and women of all ages \u2014 and, finally, she thanked her family.\n\nLater, while backstage, Kidman continued applauding her fellow actors. \u201cYou look at Frances McDormand, you look at Saoirse [Ronan], you look at Margot Robbie right now \u2014 I want to acknowledge the women who\u2019ve come before me who are still vibrant and working, and I did that in my speech. I just love that we\u2019re employed and we\u2019re working right now,\u201d she said. \u201cI watch actors and actresses and I learn so much still, every time I watch the performances. I look back at the greats, Ingrid Bergman and Vivien Leigh and Anna Magnani, so I\u2019m a fan as well and this is what I do.\u201d\n\nKidman has been raking in accolades for her portrayal of Celeste Wright, a woman grappling with domestic abuse and her love for her husband, also winning a Golden Globe, Emmy, and Critics\u2019 Choice award for the role. Throughout awards season, she has used the role of Celeste to champion women\u2019s voices and speak out against domestic violence. She was also a key force in producing the project and has taken home Golden Globe and Emmy Awards for Best Limited Series.\n\nThis marked her tenth overall SAG nomination, but it was her first win. She beat out her Big Little Lies costars Laura Dern and Reese Witherspoon, as well as Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon for their work on Feud: Bette and Joan.\n\nSee the full list of winners from the
