She paired the poplin dress with her go-to Castaner wedges and SensiStudio bucket bag. So chic.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BU7WQH-lBmX/?taken-by=pippamidleton&hl=en\n\nJetting into Darwin on a private plane, the 33-year-old sported an aztec print shirt dress teamed with tan sandals, a matching belt and SensiStudio bucket bag.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BUx1LOFlC_C/?taken-by=pippamidleton&hl=en\n\nAfter climbing the Sydney Harbour Bridge, Pippa and James enjoyed dinner at waterfront restaurant Flying Fish.\n\nTrue to Middleton form, she wore a Kate Spade floral tie mini dress \u2013 which has unfortunately sold out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKeeping things casual, Middleton opted for a Orla Kiely blouse with skinny jeans and her SensiStudio basket bag.\n\nFor footwear, she opted for the perfect holiday shoe \u2013 lace-up espadrilles. These ones are the \u2018Carina\u2019 canvas style from Castaner.\n\nFor a day of exploring in Sydney, Pippa kicked things off in a printed Kate Spade dress, accented with a waist clinching belt and tassel adorned necktie. The flattering cut is perfect on Middleton, who styled the fit-and-flare with Persol sunglasses and a chain strap.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor footwear, the new bride proves espadrilles are the versatile choice this season, opting for the same lace-up pair.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Pippa Middleton shows off her bikini bod while on honeymoon with James Matthews.
