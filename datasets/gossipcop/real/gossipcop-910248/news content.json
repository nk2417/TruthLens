Thank you, John Travolta for the glass. And I have to say, yes I did, I had two pieces. Two pieces. This is my second piece. Why? Because it\u2019s my birthday. You can have two pieces on your birthday,\u201d Winfrey said in a video shared on Instagram.\n\n\u201cFavorite meal for my birthday! Thank you for all your birthday greetings.
