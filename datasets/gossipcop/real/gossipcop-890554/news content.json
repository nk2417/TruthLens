Teresa tore Sofia apart.\n\nHere's what happened, according to Teresa. She and Sofia took a pic last week together while at a media event and Sofia supposedly stepped in front of her to steal the spotlight. Then she griped about posing with Teresa.\n\nTeresa straight-up calls Sofia a bitch. She then gets xenophobic ... saying immigrants should be good-natured.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/ae/16by9/2025/11/18/aeefcdcaa57f433dbb660222c68f6031_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/50/o/2017/10/30/500ca3b42ace5e3582b6ea7d4c40a32a_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/a6/16by9/2017/10/30/a69f9f216ebc5b81967da8cb1583c470_xl.jpeg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/thirtymilezone.svg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/88/16by9/2017/10/30/8806b8abc0c05655ab41ef2f2cea200c_md.jpeg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/9c/16by9/2017/08/26/9c5cd8ffd9da5121868ae505d4e42a66_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/ec/16by9/2017/10/24/ec8fcbdfee735c72bcc2551416fff71c_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/51/16by9/2025/11/19/5111efdc691245879252c6316ec4998f_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/d1/16by9/2025/11/19/d154454483d14293b9da0a967f66c805_xs.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/article/google-preferred-source.png", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/28/16by9/2025/11/19/281897dd8fc94f789e10d8ee5f6498cb_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/ff/16by9/2025/11/19/fffa59b411c94fc6868ff264a08c1b45_xs.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/a6/16by9/2017/10/30/a69f9f216ebc5b81967da8cb1583c470_xl.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2017/10/31/teresa-giudice-calls-sofia-vergara-bitch-nice-immigrant-rhonj/", "title": "Teresa Giudice Calls Sofia Vergara a Bitch and a Not-So-Nice Immigrant", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=0.25,maximum-scale=10", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "google-site-verification": "UUmtbUBf3djgPpCeLefe_PbFsOc6JGxfXmHzpjFLAEQ", "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "p": {"domain_verify": "933e74ace98032aadbc3328616280038"}, "robots": "index,follow,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Teresa Giudice thinks Sofia Vergara acted like a \"bitch\" during a photo-op, which is totally out of line.", "fb": {"app_id": 310610065699820}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tmz"}, "og": {"site_name": "TMZ", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.tmz.com/2017/10/31/teresa-giudice-calls-sofia-vergara-bitch-nice-immigrant-rhonj/", "title": "Teresa Giudice Calls Sofia Vergara a Bitch and a Not-So-Nice Immigrant", "description": "Teresa Giudice thinks Sofia Vergara acted like a \"bitch\" during a photo-op, which is totally out of line.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/a6/16by9/2017/10/30/a69f9f216ebc5b81967da8cb1583c470_xl.jpeg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TMZ", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Teresa Giudice Calls Sofia Vergara a Bitch and a Not-So-Nice Immigrant", "description": "Teresa Giudice thinks Sofia Vergara acted like a \"bitch\" during a photo-op, which is totally out of line.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/a6/16by9/2017/10/30/a69f9f216ebc5b81967da8cb1583c470_xl.jpeg"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=299948601, app-argument=https://www.tmz.com/2017/10/31/teresa-giudice-calls-sofia-vergara-bitch-nice-immigrant-rhonj/?tmz#article", "application-name": "TMZ.COM", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TMZ.COM", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/msapplication-tile-image-270x270-v1.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.tmz.com/?adid=IE9pin", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#000000", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-tooltip": "TMZ | Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Photos;action-uri=https://www.tmz.com/photos/;icon-uri=https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/favicon-32x32-v1.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509422400.0, "source": "https://www.tmz.com", "summary": ""}
