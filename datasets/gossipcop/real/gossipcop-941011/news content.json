Which is why the mom of two was one step ahead of potential online trolls and posted a caption condemning anyone who had a negative thing to say about her sink-bathing babies.\n\n\"Heart explodes,\" she wrote alongside the first snap. \"And heads up, if you have some weird issue with this, you're weird.\"\n\nAlthough some commenters admonished her for not caring \"about all the perverts out there\" and insisted that she keep naked photos like this private, most of her fans applauded her message and hilariously took issue with everything but her adorable kiddos.\n\n\"The only problem I have with this is your sink is about as big as my bathtub,\" one person wrote. Another echoed the sentiment: \"I have an issue with the copper faucet . . . I want one!\"\n\nStill others noticed the \"creepy red doll on the side of the sink.\" One person wrote: \"I have a HUGE issue with the staples in the back of Elmo's head. WHO HURT HIM?\" to which Teigen replied, \"oh my god he's a monster I didn't notice.\"", "images": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/OhkGndENu-aY5KZyWfLRQsdyWF4=/fit-in/1200x627/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2018/10/08/713/n/24155406/d0d779535bbb80da7d14e7.36046201_.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/OhkGndENu-aY5KZyWfLRQsdyWF4=/fit-in/1200x627/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2018/10/08/713/n/24155406/d0d779535bbb80da7d14e7.36046201_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Schweitzer", "Updated On Oct", "At Pm"], "canonical_link": "https://www.popsugar.com/family/chrissy-teigen-photos-kids-bathing-together-45353252", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Posts Photo of Luna and Miles Taking a Bath Together \u2014 and Her Caption Is Spot On", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "keywords": "popsugar, kate schweitzer, family, parenting humor, chrissy teigen, celebrity families", "robots": "max-image-preview:large, follow, index", "bingbot": "nocache", "google-site-verification": "-ULnbgnS51gqvbNlz7JAhFDpYe74n2hhzpfc4KXeONA", "description": "PS makes wellness more accessible through real-life stories, first-person perspectives, and expert-backed information.
