She took to Twitter and wrote, \u201csorry, but nothing about you guys' fan fiction stories are true...I still love you tho \ud83d\ude18.\u201d\n\nRelated News\n\nShe followed that tweet with another that said, \u201cThe internet is a wild place. It's a whole other reality. Bless the internet. Amen.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, The Jasmine Brand reported that Sean and Aiko were on the rocks and that the rapper and former Pussycat Dolls singer Nicole Scherzinger were seen flirting at an Oscars party. Following that incident, Aiko unfollowed Sean on Instagram and stirred whispers about a breakup.\n\nWhile cameras weren\u2019t allowed inside the Oscars party, an unnamed insider who was in the room told The Jasmine Brand that Aiko would have disapproved of the two talking. \u201c[Sean and Scherzinger] both attended an Oscar Awards after-party together and were cozied up together sitting at a table in VIP,\u201d the source claimed. \u201cThey were all over each other and they looked really comfortable around each other. They looked like they were a couple.\u201d\n\nWhen Aiko allegedly heard of their flirtation, she was livid. The source continued, \u201cShe was pissed, she confronted him about it, and he didn\u2019t really deny it.\u201d\n\nThe Shade Room initially captured proof that Aiko unfollowed Sean and published it in a since-deleted Instagram post. But now, the singer has gone back to following Sean. The two started dating in 2016; toward the end of 2017, Aiko even got a portrait tattoo of Sean on the back of her arm.", "images": ["https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,c_fill,ar_1.32,w_2048,g_auto/v1723865430/sanity-new/jhene-aiko-big-sean-133522778.jpg", "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723865431/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-3552-1670469196-108_16x9-6480991"], "top_img": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723865431/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-3552-1670469196-108_16x9-6480991", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tara Mahadevan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.complex.com/music/a/cmplxtara-mahadevan/jhene-aiko-shoots-down-big-sean-cheating-rumors", "title": "Jhen\u00e9 Aiko Shoots Down Big Sean Cheating Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Jhen\u00e9 Aiko follows Big Sean again on Instagram, dismisses recent cheating rumors.", "og": {"title": "Jhen\u00e9 Aiko Shoots Down Big Sean Cheating Rumors", "description": "Jhen\u00e9 Aiko follows Big Sean again on Instagram, dismisses...", "url": "https://www.complex.com/music/a/cmplxtara-mahadevan/jhene-aiko-shoots-down-big-sean-cheating-rumors", "site_name": "Complex", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723865431/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-3552-1670469196-108_16x9-6480991", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "@complex", "id": 13049362}, "title": "Jhen\u00e9 Aiko Shoots Down Big Sean Cheating Rumors", "description": "Jhen\u00e9 Aiko follows Big Sean again on Instagram, dismisses recent cheating rumors.", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723865431/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-3552-1670469196-108_16x9-6480991"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.complex.com", "summary": ""}
