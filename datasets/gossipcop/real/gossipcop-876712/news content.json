The comedienne opened up about the headline-making incident on Australian talk show Sunrise earlier this week, backtracking on her previous mea culpa.\n\n\u201cI am no longer sorry, the whole outrage was B.S, the whole thing got so blown out of proportion,\u201d she said. \u201cI lost everybody.\u201d\n\n. @KathyGriffin: \u201cI\u2019m no longer sorry. The whole outrage was BS. The whole thing got so blown out of proportion.\u201d pic.twitter.com/5PxNrQ2VSk \u2014 Jeffrey Guterman (@JeffreyGuterman) August 29, 2017\n\nSince she first posted an image of herself holding up what looked to be a bloodied head, Griffin has been fired from her annual CNN New Year\u2019s Eve program, dropped from deals with advertisers like Squatty Potty and investigated by the Secret Service.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t just lose one night on CNN. My entire tour was canceled within 24 hours because every single theater got all these death threats,\u201d she added. \u201cThese Trump fans, they\u2019re hardcore.\u201d\n\nWhen TV host Samantha Armytage then asked Griffin whether she thought she had crossed a line by sharing the graphic image, the veteran comic got defensive.\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re full of crap. Stop this,\u201d she said. \u201cStop acting like my little picture is more important than talking about the actual atrocities that the president of the United States is committing.\u201d\n\nGriffin also noted that non-Republicans had turned on her as well, including Chelsea Clinton and Debra Messing, who had both tweeted to condemn her actions. But Griffin felt the impact most deeply when her close friend and longtime New Year\u2019s Eve cohost Anderson Cooper disavowed her with a single tweet.\n\n\u201cFor the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in,\u201d he wrote at the time. \u201cIt is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Cut, four of Cooper\u2019s CNN colleagues reached out to Griffin repeatedly in subsequent days to make sure she was OK; Cooper didn\u2019t reach out to Griffin until August 10th. Via a series of text messages, she soon told him their friendship was over, The Cut reports.\n\nCooper told Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live in July that the pair are \u201cstill friends,\u201d and that he hopes \u201cshe bounces back.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kathy-griffin-not-apologetic-trump-head-hoax-5d0e5f42-78d2-40da-b1b7-656e4d1370d3.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kathy-griffin-not-apologetic-trump-head-hoax-5d0e5f42-78d2-40da-b1b7-656e4d1370d3.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/kathy-griffin-is-no-longer-sorry-about-trump-photo-shoot-outrage-was-b-s-196289/", "title": "Kathy Griffin 'No Longer Sorry' About Trump Photo Shoot", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Months after her Trump decapitation photo shoot, Kathy Griffin says entire situation was \"blown out of proportion\" and rescinds her original apology.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Joyce Chen", "tags": "Donald Trump", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kathy Griffin Is 'No Longer Sorry' About Controversial Trump Photo Shoot", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/kathy-griffin-is-no-longer-sorry-about-trump-photo-shoot-outrage-was-b-s-196289/", "description": "Months after her Trump decapitation photo shoot, Kathy Griffin says entire situation was \"blown out of proportion\" and rescinds her original apology.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kathy-griffin-not-apologetic-trump-head-hoax-5d0e5f42-78d2-40da-b1b7-656e4d1370d3.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "width": 1600, "height": 900, "alt": "kathy griffin president donald trump severed head hoax"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-30T17:30:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T14:37:30+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Months after her Trump decapitation photo shoot, Kathy Griffin says entire situation was \"blown out of proportion\" and rescinds her original apology.", "site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kathy Griffin Is \u2018No Longer Sorry\u2019 About Trump Photo Shoot: Outrage Was \u2018B.S.\u2019", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kathy-griffin-not-apologetic-trump-head-hoax-5d0e5f42-78d2-40da-b1b7-656e4d1370d3.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504114225.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
