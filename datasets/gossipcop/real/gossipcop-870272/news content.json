It simplifies people,\u201d she says of the rainbows-and-sunshine-filled lifestyle she\u2019s often portrayed by the media to have. \u201cNot all men, but a subsection of men, have a desire to understand and control women. To do that, you have to paint them into this thing you can wrap your head around. But women are complex. It also is [a reminder] that what you see in the media is not real life.\u201d\n\nThe issue of understanding women as complex people isn\u2019t just limited to Lively IRL. She also told Glamour that characters in Hollywood are most often two-dimensional, but having women take the reins to produce their projects\u2014as with breakout blockbuster Wonder Woman\u2014is a step in the right direction.\n\nStill, in how she portrays herself to the public, this pressure for perfection has caused Lively significant stress. \u201cThe night before an interview, I have complete anxiety: How is this person going to spin me?\u201d she tells Glamour. \u201cSo when you read, \u2018Oh, she\u2019s got a perfect life,\u2019 or \u2018Her life is crumbling\u2019\u2014they pick narratives for everyone. And the narratives stick.\u201d\n\nOne way Lively tries to avoid these misleading descriptors ascribed to her? She admits that she\u2019s careful to qualify how much she loves her husband for fear that people will once again assume that they\u2019re the perfect couple. Lively says, \u201cI said, \u2018Most of the time,\u2019 because if I say, \u2018I\u2019m so in love with him all the time,\u2019 then you get that eye-rolling, \u2018Oh, her life is so great, she\u2019s so perfect.\u2019 So it\u2019s, like, my defense mechanism.\u201d\n\nIn somewhat related news, Lively posted this photo on her Instagram yesterday.\n\nRELATED: Blake Lively Is Going to Play an MMA Fighter in Her Most Intense Role Yet\n\nSee What\u2019s Trending in W Video:", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/31/597f58299462ca30827df0d3_blake.jpg?w=414&h=233&fit=crop&crop=faces&dpr=2", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.comp?c1=2&c2=17519299&v=3.9.1&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/31/597f582ed971e022b386ce13_GettyImages-683599412.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/31/597f582ed971e022b386ce13_GettyImages-683599412.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/blake-lively-wants-you-to-know-her-life-isnt-perfect", "title": "Blake Lively Wants You to Know Her Life Isn\u2019t Perfect", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/blake-lively-wants-you-to-know-her-life-isnt-perfect", "title": "Blake Lively Wants You to Know Her Life Isn't Perfect", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/07/31/597f582ed971e022b386ce13_GettyImages-683599412.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "description": "\"What you see in the media is not real life.\"", "site_name": "W Magazine"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@wmag"}, "description": "\"What you see in the media is not real life.\"", "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-31T21:37:37.000Z", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wmagazine"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501537057.0, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
