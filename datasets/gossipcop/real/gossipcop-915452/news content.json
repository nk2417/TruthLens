In November Underwood had a scary fall outside of her home that required more than 40 stitches on her face and surgery on her wrist. More recently, her husband announced he was coming out of retirement to play hockey once again this season for the Nashville Predators.\n\nBut no matter how much pressure they're under, they both know they've got the ultimate support system: each other. \"My husband is as wonderful as he is hot, and I feel like that's rare,\" Underwood has said. \"He's amazing. He's such a great dad and he's so supportive of what I do and I'm supportive of him and we just love our little family.\"\n\nFollow Redbook on Instagram.\n\n", "images":
