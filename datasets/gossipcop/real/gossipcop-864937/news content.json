On Tuesday, the American Idol alum nonchalantly shut down a body-shaming comment on Twitter.\n\n\u201cThank u 2 every person in service 4 protecting all of us and cheers to every person who fought for us to experience freedom & independence,\u201d Clarkson tweeted on the Fourth of July. While most of her followers responded with their own stories of family members or loved ones in the armed forces, or tweeted their thanks to Clarkson for her sweet message, one person seized the opportunity to offer their non sequitur opinion.\n\nThank u 2 every person in service 4 protecting all of us and cheers to every person who fought for us to experience freedom & independence ? \u2014 Kelly Clarkson (@kelly_clarkson) July 5, 2017\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re fat,\u201d the troll in question tweeted, to which Clarkson had a ready response. \u201c\u2026 and still fucking awesome,\u201d she replied with a winking emoji. The original user\u2019s tweet has since been deleted.\n\n\u2026.and still fucking awesome ? https://t.co/LvFgIITaTX \u2014 Kelly Clarkson (@kelly_clarkson) July 5, 2017\n\nIn 2015, Clarkson similarly faced off against a body shamer with the same characteristic poise and resolve. British personality Katie Hopkins attacked Clarkson\u2019s weight gain on Twitter after the singer appeared on Graham Norton Live. Clarkson addressed the controversy on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, telling the talk show host that she\u2019s used to being criticized for her weight, but that it no longer bothers her.\n\n\u201cI love how people think that\u2019s new \u2013 like, \u2018Welcome to the past 13 years,'\u201d she said. \u201cYeah, I was the biggest girl on [American Idol] too. And I wasn\u2019t big, but people would call me big because I was the biggest one on Idol, and I\u2019ve kind of always gotten that. \u2026 It\u2019s like, you\u2019re just who you are. We are who we are. Whatever size, and it doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re gonna be that forever.\u201d\n\nTrending Stories Kevin Spacey Says He Has 'No Home' After Sexual Misconduct Allegations 2025 CMA Awards: The Complete Winners List \u2018Faith Is Under Attack': Nicki Minaj Spreads Misleading Information at the United Nations Neighbor Indicted in Murder of \u2018King of the Hill\u2019 Star Jonathan Joss\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing. Sometimes we\u2019re more fit. Like especially me, I\u2019m such a creative person that I yo-yo,\u201d she continued. \u201cSo, sometimes I\u2019m more fit and I get into kickboxing hardcore. And then sometimes I don\u2019t, and I\u2019m like, \u2026 I\u2019d rather have wine.\u201d\n\nClarkson has cautiously supported Kesha in her legal battle against producer, Dr. Luke, with whom Clarkson has also worked extensively. Just last year, the Idol alum offered her own negative experience with the producer. Clarkson tweeted in February 2016: \u201cTrying 2 not say anything since I can\u2019t say anything nice about a person \u2026 so this is me not talking about Dr. Luke.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-kelly-clarkson-c2ba3933-7f37-41a4-8670-5685323a091d.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-kelly-clarkson-c2ba3933-7f37-41a4-8670-5685323a091d.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kelly-clarkson-shuts-down-body-shamer-with-four-simple-words-194427/", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Shuts Down Body Shamer With Four Simple Words", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "'American Idol' alum Kelly Clarkson shows how to handle online bullying when someone tweets, \"You're fat\"", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Joyce Chen", "tags": "Kelly Clarkson", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Shuts Down Body Shamer With Four Simple Words", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kelly-clarkson-shuts-down-body-shamer-with-four-simple-words-194427/", "description": "'American Idol' alum Kelly Clarkson shows how to handle online bullying when someone tweets, \"You're fat\"", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-kelly-clarkson-c2ba3933-7f37-41a4-8670-5685323a091d.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1", "width": 1500, "height": 900, "alt": "Kelly Clarkson"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-05T21:17:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T13:38:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "'American Idol' alum Kelly Clarkson shows how to handle online bullying when someone tweets, \"You're fat\"", "site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Shuts Down Body Shamer With Four Simple Words", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-kelly-clarkson-c2ba3933-7f37-41a4-8670-5685323a091d.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499289435.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
