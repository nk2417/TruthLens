That occurs when an electrical problem causes the heart to stop pumping completely. When that happens, oxygenated blood fails to reach the brain, lungs and other organs. (In the last two weeks, rock icon Tom Petty and Playboy founder Hugh Hefner both died as a result of cardiac arrest.)\n\nMore: Cardiac arrest vs. heart attacks\n\nMay, who was born in Tennessee and raised in Arkansas, grew up idolizing 1980s comedy star Sam Kinison.\n\nHe mined his obesity for laughs as part of his standup routine. He eventually parlayed a second-place finish in Season 1 of NBC's Last Comic Standing into multiple stand-up specials for Comedy Central and Netflix.\n\nPokluda noted in her statement that May had just won the Casino Comedian of the Year award at the Global Gaming Expo. His residency at Harrah's Las Vegas was supposed to last through the end of the year.\n\nHis manager, Judi Marmel, told USA TODAY he was also working on a new comedy special and had completed his autobiography, This Might Get a Little Heavy, for St. Martin's Press. It's due this spring.\n\nIn a statement, she wrote: \"As his manager and his friend, I will miss his laugh, his generosity to fellow comedians, his trademark orneriness, and his enormous love of life. He left us entirely too soon \u2014 and we can only wonder where his comedy might have taken all of us. We send our love to his family, his fans, and all the comics who shared stages with him across the country.\"\n\nMay is survived by his wife Lahna Turner and two children, daughter April June May and son August James May.\n\nFellow comedians ranging from Kevin Hart to Larry the Cable Guy remembered him on Twitter after hearing the news.", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/174bf510288d586a78e4964be824c0dc27372658/c=0-0-600-600/local/-/media/2019/03/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636880930542746676-Jayme-Deerwester.jpg?width=48&height=48&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/ca5f5fc8e80f7705c19c572f53888cbff4c44107/c=0-164-3000-1859/local/-/media/2017/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/636429098555406398-D03-Last-Comic-18.jpg?width=3000&height=1695&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.usatoday.com/gciaf/prod/p?a=pageview&p=USAT-TEALIUM-TANGENT&m=web&k=f14ebdd6-0569-4c64-af73-99937bc06379&s=noscript"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/ca5f5fc8e80f7705c19c572f53888cbff4c44107/c=0-164-3000-1859/local/-/media/2017/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/636429098555406398-D03-Last-Comic-18.jpg?width=3000&height=1695&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/10/06/comedian-ralphie-may-dies-a-45-t/741156001/", "title": "Ralphie May dies at 45; stand-up comedy world mourns", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Ralphie May dies at 45; stand-up comedy world mourns", "description": "A Season 1 contestant on the reality show 'Last Man Standing,' the comedian went on to do standup specials for Comedy Central and Netflix.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/10/06/comedian-ralphie-may-dies-a-45-t/741156001/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/ca5f5fc8e80f7705c19c572f53888cbff4c44107/c=0-164-3000-1859/local/-/media/2017/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/636429098555406398-D03-Last-Comic-18.jpg?width=3000&height=1695&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3000, "height": 1695}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Jayme Deerwester", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "A Season 1 contestant on the reality show 'Last Man Standing,' the comedian went on to do standup specials for Comedy Central and Netflix.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 1279862243338849}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/ca5f5fc8e80f7705c19c572f53888cbff4c44107/c=0-164-3000-1859/local/-/media/2017/10/06/USATODAY/USATODAY/636429098555406398-D03-Last-Comic-18.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Ralphie May dies at 45; stand-up comedy world mourns", "description": "A Season 1 contestant on the reality show 'Last Man Standing,' the comedian went on to do standup specials for Comedy Central and Netflix."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507262400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
