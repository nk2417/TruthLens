The series launched in December 2009 as the first spinoff from MTV\u2019s 16 and Pregnant.

We also get a hint of each family\u2019s issue just by their photos on the wall.\n\n\u201cI want you to be my father,\u201d Brandi yells at her dad.\n\n\u201cI tried to give you a family,\u201d Amber says to Matt. \u201cI don\u2019t want that family,\u201d he responds.\n\nRelated: Most Tumultuous Relationships in Reality TV It wouldn\u2019t be reality TV without a little bit of a mess. That\u2019s definitely the case when it comes to finding love in front of the cameras. Over the years, fans have seen explosive fights and breakups on a wide variety of reality shows, including The Bachelor, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Temptation Island and [\u2026]\n\nOf course, Amber and Matt do not end up together at the end of this \u2014 but the show does impact her life in a huge way. Amber, 27, actually met her current boyfriend, Andrew Glennon, while filming this season of Marriage Boot Camp as he was part of the camera crew. The two are now expecting their first child together. During a recent episode of Teen Mom OG, the cinematographer actually revealed to Amber\u2019s friends that during shooting, he would try to always shoot her scenes so he could be in the same room with her.\n\nRelated: Amber Portwood Through the Years Click through to relive Amber Portwood\u2019s life on \u2018Teen Mom\u2019 through the years\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to expect.
