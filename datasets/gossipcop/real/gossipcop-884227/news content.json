That was late on Sunday night - 22:08 local time (05:08 GMT on Monday).\n\nHundreds of concert-goers scrambled for cover, flattening themselves against the ground, rushing for the exits or helping others to escape as Paddock sprayed the site from his high vantage point.\n\nGetty Images Hundreds of concert-goers fled the scene or ducked for cover amid heavy gunfire\n\n\"One man had blood all over him and that's when I knew something was seriously wrong,\" Mike Thompson from London, told the BBC.\n\n\"People were running and there was chaos.\"\n\nConcert-goer Mike McGarry, who survived, told Reuters he lay on top of his children when the shots rang out.\n\n\"They're 20, I'm 53. I lived a good life,\" he said.\n\nMany hotels on the Las Vegas strip close to the scene were placed on police lockdown and parts of Las Vegas Boulevard were shut.\n\nAldean, who was rushed off-stage, shared his reaction on Instagram.\n\n\"Tonight has been beyond horrific,\" he wrote.\n\nLas Vegas police say the number of people injured stands at 515.\n\nWhat do we know of the gunman?\n\nPaddock family Suspected gunman Stephen Paddock - undated image\n\nStephen Paddock, from a community of senior citizens in the small town of Mesquite north-east of Las Vegas, booked into the hotel on 28 September, police say.\n\nHis motives for carrying out the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history remain a mystery. Some investigators have suggested psychological issues, but there is no confirmation of this.\n\nHis brother, Eric, is dumbfounded that he acted this way.\n\nEric Paddock says he is in total shock after police named his brother, Stephen, as the shooter\n\nLas Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardo described the shooting as a \"lone wolf\" attack.\n\n\"We have no idea what his belief system was,\" he said.\n\nSo-called Islamic State (IS) has claimed to be behind the attack, saying that Paddock had converted to Islam some months ago.\n\nBut the group provided no evidence for this and has made unsubstantiated claims in the past.\n\nFBI Special Agent Aaron Rouse told a news conference: \"We have determined at this point no connection to an international terrorist organisation.\"\n\nIS's claim of responsibility for the Las Vegas attack is very unusual in that the perpetrator's profile does not fit that of supporters or \"soldiers\" that the group has claimed in the past, writes Mina al-Lami, who monitors jihadist groups for the BBC.\n\nIf true, his suicide would be deemed wholly \"un-Islamic\", she adds.\n\nJihadist suicides involve the assailant blowing himself up in order to kill those around him.\n\nGetty Images A couple at the concert take cover after gunfire was heard at country music festival\n\nThe investigation continues to gather pace, with searches at Paddock's Mesquite home, where more weapons were found, and a second property.\n\nPaddock lived in Mesquite with Marilou Danley. Police have interviewed her but say she does not appear to have been involved as she was out of the country. They are hoping to speak to her again.\n\nPolice say he used some of her identity documents to check in to the Mandalay Bay.\n\nWho are the victims?\n\nThe authorities have yet to confirm the identities of any of the 58 killed.\n\nJordan McIldoon, 23, from British Columbia in Canada, has been identified as a victim of the attack by CBC News.\n\nA nurse, Sonny Melton, of Big Sandy, Tennessee, has been named as another victim by The Jackson Sun newspaper.\n\nIn a Facebook post, his wife, Dr Heather Gulish Melton, said she \"lost my true love and knight in shining armor. I appreciate the prayers but I just need some time.\"\n\nAn off-duty Las Vegas police officer was another of those who died.\n\n'Mass shootings like a plague'\n\nBy the BBC's James Cook in Las Vegas\n\nThe scenes which played out in this stunned city were at once frantically urgent and wearily familiar.\n\nWhen gunfire rings out, Americans know the drill. Run.\n\nThey fled from a gunman who left a city in chaos.\n\nFor a time, Las Vegas looked and felt like a war zone. Hospitals were overwhelmed. There were not enough ambulances. A plea for blood donations echoed across the airwaves.\n\nAnd now the mourning, the relief, the tears, the elation, the grief and a hundred other emotions are barely beginning.\n\nDoctors are still battling to save lives.\n\nFor a Western democracy, the United States has seen an astonishing amount of horror like this.\n\nBut even for this country what happened here is carnage on a different scale.\n\nAmerica's mass shooting disease now feels like a plague.\n\nWhat gun laws does Nevada have?\n\nNevada has some of the least stringent gun laws in the United States.\n\nPeople are allowed to carry weapons and do not have to register themselves as a gun-owner.\n\nBackground checks are done when people buy guns, but they are also allowed to sell them privately.\n\nFormer congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a shooting six years ago, called for political leaders in Washington to introduce tougher gun laws following the Las Vegas attack.", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/7A58/production/_98102313_042134217.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/164B8/production/_98102319_gettyimages-856538172.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/12657/production/_98115357_3b03414c-ec7b-4637-a9bc-2074e74c0e19.jpg.webp", "https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/mcs/media/images/76020000/jpg/_76020974_line976.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/10951/production/_98112976_mandalay_bay_hotel_shooting_976map_v2-nc.png.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/13DA8/production/_98102318_gettyimages-856538172.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/13061/production/_98112977_us_shootings_comparisons_640gr-nc.png.webp"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/164B8/production/_98102319_gettyimages-856538172.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41466116", "title": "Las Vegas shooting: At least 59 dead at Mandalay Bay Hotel", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "page.section": "News", "page.subsection": "Us_and_canada", "og": {"title": "Las Vegas shooting: At least 59 dead at Mandalay Bay Hotel", "description": "Another 527 were injured as the gunman fired on a concert - the worst US shooting in recent history.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/164B8/production/_98102319_gettyimages-856538172.jpg", "alt": "People at concert duck behind barrier and take cover"}}, "twitter": {"title": "Las Vegas shooting: At least 59 dead at Mandalay Bay Hotel", "description": "Another 527 were injured as the gunman fired on a concert - the worst US shooting in recent history.", "image": {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/164B8/production/_98102319_gettyimages-856538172.jpg", "alt": "People at concert duck behind barrier and take cover"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Another 527 were injured as the gunman fired on a concert - the worst US shooting in recent history.", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364147881, app-argument=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41466116", "version": "web-2.33.2-3", "al": {"ios": {"url": "bbcx://news/world-us-canada-41466116", "app_store_id": 364147881, "app_name": "BBC: World News & Stories"}, "android": {"url": "bbcx://news/world-us-canada-41466116", "app_name": "BBC: World News & Stories", "package": "bbc.mobile.news.ww"}, "web": {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41466116"}}, "cXenseParse": {"pageclass": "article", "publishtime": "2017-10-02T05:55:50.000Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2017-10-02T22:30:25.000Z"}, "next-head-count": 41}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.bbc.com", "summary": ""}
