Creator Mitch Hurwitz revealed on social media that he\u2019s recut the entire season and will be releasing it on Netflix as Arrested Development Season 4 Remix: Fateful Consequences.\n\nThe original Season 4 focused on one character per episode. \u201cThe goal was that by the end of the season a unified story of cause and effect would emerge for the viewer \u2014 full of surprises about how the Bluths were responsible for most of the misery they had endured,\u201d Hurwitz wrote.\n\nNetflix\n\nIn between Season 4 and the upcoming Season 5, Hurwitz said he recut the season, \u201cshuffling the content from 15 individualized stories into 22 interwoven stories the length of the original series,\u201d admittedly to see if he \u201ccould make some money\u201d in eventual syndication. But also, he said, as a comedic experiment to see if new jokes and a new perspective would emerge from a remix that features all the Bluths in every episode, and where the simultaneity of the story plays out chronologically.\u201d\n\nThe recut version will begin streaming May 4 on Netflix. Hurwitz also noted that Season 5 will be coming soon.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nYou can read Hurwitz\u2019s entire message below:", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/netflix-logo-print_cmyk.jpg", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arrested-development-season-4.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arrested-development-season-4.jpg?w=1024", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arrested-development-season-4.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Denise Petski", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/05/arrested-development-season-4-remix-release-mitch-hurwitz-1202380474/", "title": "\u2018Arrested Development\u2019 Season 4 Is Getting A Remix", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The fourth season of Arrested Development will be released again -- as a remix.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Denise Petski", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Arrested Development\u2019 Season 4 Is Getting A Remix", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/05/arrested-development-season-4-remix-release-mitch-hurwitz-1202380474/", "description": "The fourth season of Arrested Development will be released again -- as a remix.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arrested-development-season-4.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "alt": "'Arrested Development' Season 4 Is Getting A Remix"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-01T18:23:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-01T18:50:27+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The fourth season of Arrested Development will be released again -- as a remix.", "site": "@Deadline", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Arrested Development\u2019 Season 4 Is Getting A Remix", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/arrested-development-season-4.jpg?w=1024"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525198987.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
