After bringing back the original version of Flip or Flop, with stars Christina and Tarek El Moussa returning after their divorce, the network just handed out a new series order for Christina.\n\nThe 34-year-old real estate investor has signed a deal to star in Christina on the Coast, an eight-episode design series set to premiere in early 2019. And, unlike everything else on the HGTV roster, the new show will lean a little bit further into the reality TV realm \u2014 highlighting El Moussa\u2019s new life as a single mother and her move from the suburbs to the beach.\n\n\u201cEach episode is going to show a glimpse into a real life, selling my home in Yorba Linda, house-hunting and moving into my new place,\u201d El Moussa tells The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cIt\u2019s going to show me trying to balance it all with kids and work.\u201d\n\nOne of HGTV\u2019s top-rated series at its pinnacle, Flip or Flop was dealt a major blow in 2016 when the central Orange County, California, couple went through a very public split that lingered in the tabloids for months. The network responded with a whopping five spinoffs, each following different house-flippers in different cities, but ultimately got the El Moussas to reunite after their divorce. The reaction among fans has been mixed, with the El Moussas upping the onscreen snark after their separation, but the ratings remain strong. The May 31 premiere, the first new episode to air in almost a full year, netted a strong 2 million viewers and a 0.5 rating among women 18-49.\n\n\u201cChristina\u2019s design style is very popular, so it\u2019s a natural progression for us to expand her visibility with a new series,\u201d HGTV and Food president Allison Page said in a statement. \u201cHer fans also are deeply vested in her personal life and eager to see what happens next \u2014 so we\u2019re bringing them the opportunity to share in these real-life moments in a way that no one else can.\u201d\n\nAlso produced by Flip or Flop maker Pie Town Productions, Christina on the Coast began filming on Monday. Via the shingle and El Moussa, the show is going out to Orange County families in need of remodeling. Each episode will tackle a different family, with a different room of their house that requires El Moussa\u2019s design intervention. \u201cI\u2019m just helping them do one room because of the time constraints,\u201d adds El Moussa, who still has to juggling her new obligations with potential future Flip or Flop production.\n\nAs for the show that made her a HGTV name, El Moussa says she\u2019s pleased with the way the divorce episodes have turned out. \u201cI\u2019m glad we made the decision to continue the show,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was best for everyone. We\u2019re presenting a unified front. We\u2019ve got kids.\u201d\n\nTarek El Moussa is also said to be in talks to develop his own potential HGTV vehicle.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/christina_el_moussa_show_embed.jpg?w=928", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/christina_el_moussa.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/christina_el_moussa.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mikey O'Connell", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/flip-flop-spinoff-christina-el-moussa-starring-hgtv-series-christina-coast-1123457/", "title": "\u2018Flip or Flop\u2019 Star Christina El Moussa Lands Solo HGTV Spinoff", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Christina El Moussa is getting her own 8-episode spinoff, 'Christina on the Coast' \u2014 without 'Flip or Flop' co-star and ex-husband Tarek El Moussa.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Mikey O'Connell", "tags": "HGTV", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Flip or Flop\u2019 Star Christina El Moussa Lands Solo HGTV Spinoff", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/flip-flop-spinoff-christina-el-moussa-starring-hgtv-series-christina-coast-1123457/", "description": "Christina El Moussa is getting her own 8-episode spinoff, 'Christina on the Coast' \u2014 without 'Flip or Flop' co-star and ex-husband Tarek El Moussa.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/christina_el_moussa.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "'Flip or Flop' Spinoff: Christina El Moussa Starring in HGTV Series 'Christina on the Coast'"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-27T06:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-27T06:57:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Christina El Moussa is getting her own 8-episode spinoff, 'Christina on the Coast' \u2014 without 'Flip or Flop' co-star and ex-husband Tarek El Moussa.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Flip or Flop\u2019 Star Christina El Moussa Lands Solo HGTV Spinoff", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/christina_el_moussa.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530079200.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
