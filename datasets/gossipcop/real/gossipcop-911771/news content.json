At no point was I notified or consulted about Ms. Thurman driving a car on camera that day.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad I been involved,\u201d Adams continues, \u201cI would have insisted not only on putting a professional driver behind the wheel but also insuring that the car itself was road-worthy and safe.\u201d\n\nAdams \u2014 an experienced coordinator with a particular expertise in automotive work, according to veteran stunt performer and coordinator Andy Armstrong \u2014 did not say whether he thought his department was intentionally held at bay to facilitate having an actor perform driving maneuvers. It was not immediately clear who prepared the call sheet that day and who decided to idle the stunt department. Tarantino told Deadline that \u201cnone of us ever considered it a stunt. It was just driving.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe circumstances of this event were negligent to the point of criminality,\u201d said Thurman in an Instagram post Monday. \u201cI do not believe though with malicious intent.\u201d (After the crash came a cover-up which \u201cdid have malicious intent,\u201d she wrote, naming three production executives.)\n\nIt may have been \u201cjust driving\u201d to Tarantino, but performers\u2019 union SAG-AFTRA said in a statement that it \u201csounds like a stunt and would be a likely safety violation.\u201d\n\nThe new statement from the stunt coordinator underscores Thurman\u2019s description of the 1973 Karmann Ghia as a profound hazard. \u201cThat was a deathbox,\u201d she told Maureen Dowd for a New York Times story published on Feb. 3 that kicked off a round of speculation about the incident. Thurman explained to the writer that \u201cthe seat wasn\u2019t screwed down properly\u201d and that she\u2019d been told the vintage convertible had been converted from stick shift to automatic.\n\nThe car\u2019s allegedly sad shape came as no surprise to Melissa Stubbs, also a veteran stunt performer and coordinator. \u201cA picture car is usually a piece of shit,\u201d she told THR bluntly, using industry argot for vehicles that appear onscreen.\n\nArmstrong agreed, noting that non-stunt picture cars are generally towed on flatbed \u201cprocess trailers\u201d while being filmed, making it easier to rig lights and cameras and allowing an actor to give the illusion of driving without anyone being endangered. For that reason, Armstrong indicated, production personnel focus on making a picture car look good onscreen, and not necessarily on making it safely drivable.\n\nIn addition, video of the crash indicates that the then-30-year-old ragtop was without roll bars, shoulder belts or head restraints. Thurman\u2019s head whips backward and hangs over the low seat back after the crash. It\u2019s unclear whether there was a lap belt or whether Thurman was wearing it if there was.\n\n\u201cThat could have been a death by decapitation,\u201d veteran coordinator Armstrong said. \u201cThe car could easily have rolled over [or] the camera could have flown forward. It was irresponsibility on a mega level.\u201d\n\nMany people share safety duties on set: the producers (lead producer Lawrence Bender apologized Wednesday and also said he \u201cnever hid anything\u201c), the director (Thurman has described Tarantino as regretful and remorseful), the 1st assistant director (although this may be less clear in a non-DGA film like Kill Bill) \u2014 and, of course, the stunt coordinator.\n\n\u201cOn any set, my number one priority and the priority of any stunt coordinator is the safety of the cast and crew,\u201d said Adams. \u201cFor a stunt coordinator to do their job properly, they must be involved at every step of the process and given the opportunity to intervene when changes to the shoot are made.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d he added, \u201cI did not have that opportunity in this case.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kill_bill_volume_2_driving.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kill_bill_volume_2_driving.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jonathan Handel", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/kill-bill-stunt-coordinator-breaks-silence-uma-thurman-crash-1083542/", "title": "\u2018Kill Bill\u2019 Stunt Coordinator Breaks Silence on Uma Thurman Crash (Exclusive)", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "&quot;At no point was I notified or consulted about Ms. Thurman driving a car on camera that day,&quot; says coordinator Keith Adams.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Jonathan Handel", "tags": "labor, Quentin Tarantino, SAG-AFTRA, Uma Thurman", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Kill Bill\u2019 Stunt Coordinator Breaks Silence on Uma Thurman Crash (Exclusive)", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/kill-bill-stunt-coordinator-breaks-silence-uma-thurman-crash-1083542/", "description": "\"At no point was I notified or consulted about Ms. Thurman driving a car on camera that day,\" says coordinator Keith Adams.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kill_bill_volume_2_driving.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "'Kill Bill' Stunt Coordinator Breaks Silence on Uma Thurman Crash (Exclusive)"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-09T18:14:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-29T07:53:04+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"At no point was I notified or consulted about Ms. Thurman driving a car on camera that day,\" says coordinator Keith Adams.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Kill Bill\u2019 Stunt Coordinator Breaks Silence on Uma Thurman Crash (Exclusive)", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kill_bill_volume_2_driving.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518200080.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
