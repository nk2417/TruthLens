Lisa Vanderpump\u2019s SUR staff has been entertaining us for a whopping 100 episodes. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills spinoff, which premiered on Bravo in January 2013, originally followed Scheana Marie, who was featured on RHOBH because of her affair with Brandi Glanville\u2019s [\u2026]\n\n\u201cI will admit, I haven\u2019t watched the last few episodes \u2026 last season, watching my divorce wasn\u2019t as hard for me because I was in a very happy relationship, and I was madly in love with Rob,\u201d Shay told costar and BFF Ariana Madix on the Tuesday, March 6, episode of her podcast, Scheananigans.\n\n\u201cWait, you were?\u201d Madix said sarcastically.\n\n\u201cI kept it super low-key,\u201d Shay joked.\n\nAs previously reported, the SUR waitress filed for divorce from her husband of over two years, Mike Shay, in November 2016. She started dating Valletta shortly after, and viewers have been quick to criticize their relationship, calling Shay \u201cpathetic\u201d and \u201ccringeworthy\u201d on Twitter because she is seemingly more invested in their future than he is.\n\nRelated: Couples Who Survived the Reality TV Curse (So Far) Who says true love doesn\u2019t exist on reality TV? While it seems to be a trend that many marriages on reality TV end in divorce, there are still some reality TV couples out there beating the odds. Big Brother\u2018s Nicole Franzel and Victor Arroyo met while filming season 18 of Big Brother in 2016. The timing [\u2026]\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m single, I\u2019ve been single for six months now, watching back me being that happy, love drunk girl, started to get a little hard,\u201d Shay explained. \u201cObviously, you can\u2019t see every minute of every conversation \u2026 I know I look really stupid, and you know what? I was coming off a divorce. I got back with someone who I felt was my soulmate and was the one \u2026 You can\u2019t fault me for being happy and being in love.\u201d\n\n\u201cRob was very reserved on the show,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe is a person who lives his life on camera, acting and hosting, not for a reality show. For him, that was completely out of his comfort zone. He is a very private person \u2026 So for him, that was hard to have those raw emotions on there. The moments that we had in private are private moments. He did tell me he loved me. We were planning a future together, but then, just this world that he became a part of was too overwhelming for him to continue.\u201d\n\nRelated: Most Tumultuous Relationships in Reality TV History It wouldn\u2019t be reality TV without a little bit of a mess. That\u2019s definitely the case when it comes to finding love in front of the cameras. Over the years, fans have seen explosive fights and breakups on a wide variety of reality shows, including The Bachelor, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Temptation Island and [\u2026]\n\nValletta defended Shay on February 26 after fans slammed their relationship: \u201cNo one knows what happens behind closed doors and or when the cameras are off. But what I do know is that there are things that I never expressed on camera, but did in person. The reason I created space in our relationship was because of the world, not the person. @scheana and I have cared for and supported each other for 12 years no matter the circumstances or dynamic. Leaving mean or nasty comments needs to stop!\u201d\n\nVanderpump Rules airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.", "images":
