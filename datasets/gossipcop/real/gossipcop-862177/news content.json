{"url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/06/gal-gadot-wonder-woman-salary", "text": "It was a jaw-dropping stat that swiftly went viral Tuesday morning: Gal Gadot, the magnetic star of the summer hit Wonder Woman, was paid just $300,000 for a movie that had already made $573 million worldwide. Meanwhile, Henry\u2019s Cavill had been paid $14 million\u201446 times as much!\u2014for his own first outing as Superman in Man of Steel.\n\nIt would be perfectly indicative of the gender pay gap that lingers in Hollywood . . . if it were at all true. As the Elle article that sent the stat viral said itself, Cavill\u2019s $14 million earnings include bonuses for box-office performance, while Gadot\u2019s $300,000, per a 2014 Variety report, is just the base salary for each movie she\u2019s made thus far in the DC Universe. Though the details of Cavill\u2019s reported $14 million could not be verified, a source with knowledge of studio negotiations on franchise films told Vanity Fair, \u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t for one picture. That\u2019s insane.\u201d\n\nThe same source said of Gadot\u2019s salary, \u201cEntry-level actors in franchise films are paid an initial rate. As a franchise takes off, they stand to make more money.\u201d So if she signed a deal similar to Cavill\u2019s, the Wonder Woman bonus checks will soon be rolling in\u2014and the sequels could be even more lucrative. Says a source familiar with both Cavill and Gadot\u2019s contract negotiations, \u201cIf you do an apples to apples comparison, she was paid at least as much as he was.\u201d\n\nWATCH: A Brief History
