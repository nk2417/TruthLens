Nevertheless, it offers a pretty good look at the sinister symbiote being triggered by a car alarm \u2013 much to the amazement of a young kid, who can do nothing but gawk at Venom as the inky-black monster makes short work of the doomed automobile.\n\nFeast thy eyes:\n\nThis particular snippet is one of three deleted/extended scenes set to be included on the Venom Blu-ray \u2013 the other two concern Eddie and Venom\u2019s ride to the hospital, while the third is said to offer up an extended version of the post-credits scene at San Quentin. Could that mean that we\u2019ll get a better look at Woody Harrelson\u2019s Carnage? Who knows?\n\nWhat we do know, however, is that a Venom sequel is nigh on certain, after Sony\u2019s budding franchise-starter blew past all expectations on its journey to $850M worldwide. To put that eye-watering cume into perspective, that\u2019s higher than Wonder Woman and both Deadpool movies, proving that, while critics came down hard on the standalone adventure, there was still a big, big appetite for the sinister symbiote.\n\nExactly where things go from here is another question entirely, but we understand Sony\u2019s Marvel Universe is working towards new spinoff projects for Kraven, Silk, Silver and Black, and Morbius, the latter of which will star Jared Leto as the undead anti-hero.
