ABC said an announcement would come later, but one name is obviously swirling about: Ryan Seacrest.\n\nThe former \u201cIdol\u201d host has a jam-packed work schedule these days, including a new gig he started this month: serving as Kelly Ripa\u2019s co-host on ABC\u2019s \u201cLive,\u201d the second-most watched daytime TV show. On Monday, Ripa asked Seacrest on air about the reports that \u201cIdol\u201d would return.\n\n\u201cI said at the end of the series, \u2018Goodbye for now,\u2019 hoping it would come back,\u201d Seacrest told her. \u201cIt was rumored to be going to other networks. I had no idea that it was being talked about to come here until late last week. I saw some rumor in the news, so I made a phone call, and they said, \u2018Yeah it may actually end up here,\u2019 and I said, \u2018That\u2019d be good to know, since I work here.\u201d\n\nBut, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can host,\u201d given the preparation he has to do every night to be ready for \u201cLive.\u201d Ripa cut him off \u2014 \u201cYes, you can!\u201d \u2014 and said that the morning after \u201cIdol\u201d shows, \u201d you won\u2019t even have to think, I will do it all!\u201d\n\nSeacrest had been based in Los Angeles, but announced he\u2019d move to New York City for the \u201cLive\u201d job and continue his other commitments out of studios there. He\u2019s still a staple radio presence, hosting \u201cOn Air with Ryan Seacrest\u201d every weekday morning and \u201cAmerican Top 40\u201d on the weekends.\n\nOh, and Seacrest will continue to interview celebrities before all award shows on the E! red carpet; host \u201cDick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve with Ryan Seacrest\u201d on Dec. 31; and executive produce the E! Kardashian empire shows.\n\nBut how much Seacrest is too much Seacrest? He was a constant, but not a standout presence on \u201cIdol\u201d \u2014 which is why he was so good at the job, The Washington Post\u2019s Emily Yahr wrote last year.\n\n\u201cSometimes, you just forget he\u2019s there. That\u2019s intentional, and really, the mark of an excellent host,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMove the proceedings along; banter with contestants; throw in a quip or two; and make it look so easy that no one realizes how hard you\u2019re working.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s multi-talented; he\u2019s anti-talented, not a performer but a professional \u2018personality,\u2019 the latest variation on a type as old as broadcasting: the guy who stands there and introduces the acts,\u201d former Post TV critic Tom Shales wrote in a 2008 profile of Seacrest. \u201cHe\u2019s a low-key cheerleader who keeps the show moving and, with the judges as natural foils, allies himself with the audience and the contestants, never threatening to upstage the performers, even if he could.\u201d\n\n\u201cIdol\u201d was a ratings juggernaut in its early years \u2014 at times, it was America\u2019s most-watched show \u2014 but the numbers dropped toward the end of the series\u2019 run. At its peak, it drew more than 30 million viewers. But by its 15th season, that number hovered around 9 million.\n\nStill, the show had a profound and lasting influence on pop culture, shaping public perceptions of what qualified as \u201cgood singing\u201d and ushering in a new era of reality TV shows, particularly competition shows (\u201cThe Apprentice\u201d debuted two years after \u201cIdol\u201d). The show also helped launch singing careers \u2014 Jennifer Hudson, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Adam Lambert, etc. \u2014 and past contestants have collectively netted 14 Grammys, two Golden Globes and an Oscar.\n\nClearly, ABC sees massive potential in trying to recapture some of that magic, even if the playing field of reality TV remains crowded. NBC has aired its own singing competition show \u201cThe Voice\u201d since 2011, and ABC is home to \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d and \u201cDancing with the Stars.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of the intense ?speculation surrounding the comeback of \u2018American Idol\u2019 demonstrates just how popular and powerful this brand remains,\u201d Peter Hurwitz, CEO of Core Media CEO, which produces \u201cIdol,\u201d said in a statement. \u201cABC shares our belief in the enduring value of \u2018Idol\u2019 and will provide us with the perfect new home to showcase the gold standard of singing competition shows.\u201d\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nNBC in talks to revive \u2018American Idol\u2019\n\n\u2018American Idol\u2019 exits with largest finale audience in three years\n\nHow former Chicago-area contestants said goodbye to \u2018American Idol\u2019", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2560px-Chicago_Tribune_Logo.svg-1.png", "data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/05/09/Y6ZAQC7D2BA6LIMTUXUVBK56GI.jpg?w=1024&h=670"], "top_img": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/05/09/Y6ZAQC7D2BA6LIMTUXUVBK56GI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Washington Post"], "canonical_link": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2017/05/09/american-idol-is-coming-back-does-that-mean-even-more-ryan-seacrest/", "title": "\u2018American Idol\u2019 is coming back \u2014 does that mean even more Ryan Seacrest?", "meta_data": {"application-name": "chicagotribune", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Washington Post", "canonical": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2017/05/09/american-idol-is-coming-back-does-that-mean-even-more-ryan-seacrest/"}, "description": "It\u2019s officially happening: After going dark in 2016 on Fox, \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d will be back on your television sets.
