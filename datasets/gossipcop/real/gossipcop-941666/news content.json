Jordan told \u201cInsecure\u2019s\u201d Issa Rae that after he finished working on \u201cFruitvale Station,\u201d he told his agents that he didn\u2019t want to audition for roles written for African-Americans.\n\n\u201cI said, I don\u2019t want it. I want to only go for, like, [roles written for] white males. That\u2019s it,\u201d he said. \u201cMe playing that role is going to make it what it is. I don\u2019t want any pre-bias on the character.\u201d\n\nPeter Yang for Variety\n\nRae also opened up about the positive change that seems to be overtaking Hollywood\u2019s perception of what a leading actress looks like following the success of movies like \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d She that said early on in her career, her agents would send roles to her that Rae doubted she\u2019d be able to land because of her race.\n\n\u201cIf it were a leading woman of a certain type, I just knew the type that they would go for, so I\u2019m just not going to even bother,\u201d Rae said. \u201cPeople have been receptive. Even just the confidence that a movie like [\u201cBlack Panther\u201d] and other films by other filmmakers of color that have come out have really just changed what people perceive as a leading lady, as the beautiful person, the daring or the bold action-adventure type. That just feels so dope to me.\u201d\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning series will air in two episodes on PBS SoCal KOCE, the first on Tuesday, June 19 at 7 p.m. and the second on Thursday, June 21 at 7 p.m. Both episodes will stream on pbssocal.org following their premieres.\n\nWATCH THE FULL INTERVIEW HERE:", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://source.unsplash.com/random/595x333", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/issa-rae-michael-b-jordan.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/refer-banner-aoa-2018-4.png"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/issa-rae-michael-b-jordan.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ellis Clopton", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/michael-b-jordan-issa-rae-white-roles-actors-on-actors-1202829948/", "title": "Why Michael B.
