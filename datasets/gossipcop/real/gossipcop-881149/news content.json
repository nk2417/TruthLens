I don\u2019t like presents anymore.\"\n\nKardashian also revealed something that every busy couple can relate to \u2014 she and Kanye didn't do anything special for their anniversary. Well, unless you count IHOP.\n\n\u201cWe just did absolutely nothing. We spent two days in Santa Barbara, and we slept,\u201d she told Allure. \u201cYou know what? I think we went to IHOP. That\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nThis couple is keeping things as low-key as they can. Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images\n\nAs someone who once spent a \"vacation\" with my boyfriend eating Cheesecake Factory cheesecake in bed, I totally approve of the West's anniversary plan.\n\nThe Wests' new stance on gift giving is a surprising one, given that they've gone viral for giant flower walls and custom Birkan bags, but it makes sense given their relatively low-profile since Kim's horrific Paris robbery.\n\nObviously everyone enjoys a good gift, but even the Allure profile piece notes that Kim is gifted countless things out of the blue every day and she said she doesn't feel the need to have so many things around anymore. Instead she's focusing on the little things \u2014 like the treasure chest her daughter North gave her to keep her safe when she went to Paris.\n\n\u201cTo have something really sweet like that is more important to me than all the jewelry,\u201d she told them.\n\nIt seems like the Wests have realized that valuing quality time instead of material things is a love language that they prefer, which is something that's important for every couple to find out for themselves. Although it doesn't seem like they'll quit with giant displays of flowers any time soon, it's great to see that they know what's truly important \u2014 family time and pancakes.", "images": ["https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/59c125ef248849175306c2cb?width=691&format=jpeg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/59c125ef248849175306c2cb?width=691&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kristin Salaky"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-wedding-anniversary-2017-9", "title": "The way Kim Kardashian and Kanye West spent their anniversary is totally relatable", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "The way Kim Kardashian and Kanye West spent their anniversary is totally relatable", "datePublished": "2017-09-19T14:12:52.000Z", "dateModified": "2017-09-19T14:12:56.000Z", "news_keywords": "News, Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, Celebrity Couples, Health, Relationship, Culture", "description": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West did absolutely nothing for their anniversary \u2014 unless you count IHOP.", "author": "Kristin Salaky", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "tbi-vertical": "News", "og": {"title": "The way Kim Kardashian and Kanye West spent their anniversary is totally relatable", "description": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West did absolutely nothing for their anniversary \u2014 unless you count IHOP.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-wedding-anniversary-2017-9", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/59c125ef248849175306c2cb?width=691&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 691, "height": 345}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@businessinsider"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"psvp": "c"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "59c125f0248849175306c2cc", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"sections": "News", "tags": "Page Type:story"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2025-05", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.thisisinsider.com", "summary": ""}
