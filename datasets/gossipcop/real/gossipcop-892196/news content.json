The film features Swift\u2019s full concert, including 19 songs and clips from her tour across the world. It\u2019ll be available at 12:01 a.m. PT on December 31.\n\nThe Reputation Stadium Tour was the highest-grossing tour of all time with $266.1 million in sales. It broke attendance records around the world and further solidified Swift\u2019s position as the preeminent musical performer in the world.\n\nFor Netflix (NFLX), nabbing the exclusive rights to the tour is major. For one, having exclusive streaming rights to the world\u2019s most popular artist will only bolster Netflix\u2019s appeal and could attract the legion of Swift fans who might not currently subscribe to Netflix.\n\nFrom a competitive standpoint, Netflix\u2019s Swift deal is a clear blow to Apple, which has been building out its video content and investing heavily in music. Just last year, in fact, Apple (AAPL) acquired the rights to the concert film that centered on Swift\u2019s 1989 Tour. It proved to be wildly successful on Apple Music.\n\nAre you ready for it? @taylorswift13's reputation Stadium Tour is coming to Netflix on New Year's Eve! #NetflixNewsWeekpic.twitter.com/ifuM31Mzh0 \u2014 Netflix Queue (@netflixqueue) December 13, 2018\n\nGiven that, and considering Swift\u2019s success, the concert film deal couldn\u2019t have come cheap to Netflix. However, neither Swift nor Netflix have said how much Swift will make to provide the streaming rights to Netflix. Earlier this year, Netflix raised $1.9 billion in debt financing to acquire more content as it prepares to face off with an increasing number of streaming competitors, including Disney (DIS) and WarnerMedia. The company plans to raise billions more in a bond offering.", "images": ["https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-1064050490-e1544712420961.jpg?resize=1200,600"], "top_img": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-1064050490-e1544712420961.jpg?resize=1200,600", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Don Reisinger"], "canonical_link": "https://fortune.com/2018/12/13/taylor-swift-reputation-stadium-tour-netflix/", "title": "Netflix Will Air Taylor Swift Reputation Stadium Tour on NYE", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "Another way to ring in the new year.", "author": "Don Reisinger", "generator": "Taylor Swift, Netflix, Taylor Swift tour on Netflix, Taylor Swift Reputation Stadium Tour, Reputation Stadium Tour, Taylor Swift Reputation Stadium Tour on Netflix", "keywords": "Taylor Swift, Netflix, Taylor Swift tour on Netflix, Taylor Swift Reputation Stadium Tour, Reputation Stadium Tour, Taylor Swift Reputation Stadium Tour on Netflix", "publisher": "Fortune", "robots": "index, max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "og": {"height": 683, "image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-1064050490-e1544712420961.jpg?resize=1200,600", "width": 1024, "title": "Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour Movie Will Air New Year's Eve on Netflix | Fortune", "description": "Another way to ring in the new year.", "url": "https://fortune.com/2018/12/13/taylor-swift-reputation-stadium-tour-netflix/", "site_name": "Fortune", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/GettyImages-1064050490-e1544712420961.jpg?resize=1200,600", "url": "https://fortune.com/2018/12/13/taylor-swift-reputation-stadium-tour-netflix/", "card": "summary", "site": "@Fortune", "title": "Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour Movie Will Air New Year's Eve on Netflix | Fortune", "description": "Another way to ring in the new year."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1544677200.0, "source": "http://fortune.com", "summary": ""}
