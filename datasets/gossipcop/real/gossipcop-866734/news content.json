Thursday is her first day back on set as This Is Us Season 2 begins filming. \u201cIsn\u2019t that amazing?\u201c Metz says, audibly ecstatic. \u201cThis is the best welcome-back gift ever!\u201d\n\nAs for what\u2019s coming up in the NBC smash, the actress promises that fans will soon find out what, exactly, happened to Jack. (Milo Ventimiglia received his first Emmy nomination\u2014for Lead Actor\u2014on Thursday for the role.) Metz\u2019s character, Kate, expressed guilt last season about her father\u2019s death; apparently, she feels as though it\u2019s her fault somehow. The cast has known the backstory for a while, Metz said, and soon, fans will, too.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to give away anything or potentially give away anything, but we\u2019re going to find out really, really soon into the season about how it all unfortunately went down and the guilt that Kate has on her conscience, and why, and all of that,\u201d Metz promised.\n\nAs for whether she or any of the cast feel pressure going into the second season of such a buzzy, beloved show, the actress said she tries to take things in stride and stay authentic\u2014and, perhaps more importantly, vulnerable. That openness is, after all, what made her character\u2014and perhaps the whole show\u2014so popular with viewers in the first place. As Metz sees it, \u201cWe all have these ideas in our heads about what people think about us, which are so not true. And so we are always combatting what people think about us, and how we should make other people happy, and just like with Kate, she's living in the shadow of her brother and never feeling worthy of following her dreams and her passions. And so when people see that in a television show, and they see her trying to redeem herself and trying to take back her life and pursue her heart's desires, it really encourages other people to say, A., \u2018I\u2019m not alone,\u2019 and B., \u2018We\u2019re all deserving of true happiness.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all feel inadequate in some way, and if we could just realize how special we are, we wouldn\u2019t do that to one another,\u201d Metz added. \u201cAnd so I think that show is just really filling that gap and opening up people\u2019s hearts and minds to feeling worthy, and self-love, and getting away from the shame of what we have or haven\u2019t done in our relationships.\u201d", "images":
