The happy couple shared the gender of their baby in a recent episode of their podcast Hello Bump.\n\nThe two explained how they requested that the gender of the baby be placed in a sealed envelope so they could find out together.\n\n\"I can't wait to have a Daddy's girl,\" Matt, 34, gushed, adding that he would have been happy with a boy or a girl. \"I'm gonna have a little princess on my hands.\"\n\nAlthough the baby isn't due until 2018, Angela has already started shopping for her little one. The mom-to-be admitted she's purchased a few little pink items, including a pair of baby UGG boots with pink bows.\n\n\"And you were a little bit annoyed with me,\" she joked to her husband. \"Until I put them in your hand.\"\n\nMatt and Angela announced they were expecting their first child in August with multiple adorable Instagram posts.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-09/kate_middleton_prince_william_smiling_getty_696933768.jpg?h=3ae4097c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-08/1280_matt_lanter_angela_GettyImages-651025788.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/screen_shot_2017-09-16_at_1.19.55_pm.png?h=c188884e&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/screen_shot_2017-09-16_at_1.19.55_pm.png?h=c188884e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/screen_shot_2017-09-16_at_1.19.55_pm.png?h=c188884e", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/timeless-star-matt-lanter-and-his-wife-are-having-baby-girl-87378", "title": "'Timeless' Star Matt Lanter and His Wife Are Having a Baby Girl!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/screen_shot_2017-09-16_at_1.19.55_pm.png?h=c188884e", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 34-year-old actor is going to have a little princess!", "title": "'Timeless' Star Matt Lanter and His Wife Are Having a Baby Girl!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/timeless-star-matt-lanter-and-his-wife-are-having-baby-girl-87378", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 34-year-old actor is going to have a little princess!", "twitter": {"description": "The 34-year-old actor is going to have a little princess!", "title": "'Timeless' Star Matt Lanter and His Wife Are Having a Baby Girl!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/timeless-star-matt-lanter-and-his-wife-are-having-baby-girl-87378", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/screen_shot_2017-09-16_at_1.19.55_pm.png?h=c188884e", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "'Timeless' Star Matt Lanter and His Wife Are Having a Baby Girl! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Matt Lanter, Timeless", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
