Adams is apologizing after posting an unflattering photo of a woman who he says criticized his appearance at the royal wedding.\n\nIn a since-deleted Instagram post, Adams claimed a woman in the airport called him \u201cchunky\u201d in a photo from the wedding.\n\n\u201cShe reads her paper. See\u2019s picture of me and Troian from wedding,\u201d he wrote, according to screenshots published in the Daily Mail. \u201d \u2018My God. What a terrible photo of you.\u2019 I look over. \u2018Really. I kind of like that photo. What do you think is wrong with it?\u2019 She pauses. \u2018Well, you\u2019re just so\u2026.chunky.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIn response to her comment, Adams took an unflattering photo of the woman sleeping in the chair next to him.\n\n\u201cShe laughs and falls asleep,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd \u2026. scene.\u201d\n\nPatrick J. Adams and Troian Bellisario at Meghan and Prince Harry's wedding. James Gourley/REX/Shutterstock\n\nOn Monday, Adams issued an apology and explained his actions after fans called him out for bullying the woman.\n\n\u201cYesterday I posted a photo of a woman who did some casual body shaming of my wife and I in the airport,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy intention was solely to put a face to the people who think that sort of glancing commentary is necessary, helpful or funny. Some of the comments on the post instead said I was being a bully and should have taken the \u201chigh road\u201d (some also doubled down on the body shaming. Thumbs up guys!)\u201d\n\nAdams said after considering the criticism from fans, he decided to take down the post.\n\n\u201cI thought it over and agreed and took it down, not because I felt the woman was right or fair or undeserving of being called out but because any sense of being a bully or lashing out felt wrong,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019m no bully. What that woman said to us was offensive and unnecessary but I should have told her she was rude and out of line and left it at that. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t. I was too shocked and annoyed and Canadian \u2013 so I avoided the confrontation. Again, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nSophia Bush commented on the post, praising Adams for the recognizing his mistake.\n\n\u201cWell done friend,\u201d she wrote. \u201cPeople forget that you\u2019re human. This is a great teaching moment.\u201d\n\nAdams attended the royal wedding Saturday to support his former Suits costar and on-screen wife Meghan Markle as she married Prince Harry.\n\nAhead of the ceremony, Adams shared sweet words of encouragement to Meghan on Twitter.\n\n\u201cGoing to bed now and thinking a lot about the strange surreal and wonderful day my friend Meghan is going to have tomorrow. Meghan \u2013 wherever you are \u2013 we are so grateful to be here to watch you both take this monumental step together. Love deeply and live well. #RoyalWedding,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAdams\u2019 wife Troian Bellisario accompanied the actor to the wedding.\n\nAdams and Bellisario were among a handful of celebrities who scored an invited to the ceremony. George and Amal Clooney were also in attendance, along with Oprah and several other Suits costars, including Gina Torres, Sarah Rafferty and Rick Hoffman.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle.\n\nHarry and Meghan said their \u201cI dos\u201d in a fairytale ceremony in St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nMeghan, who arrived at the chapel with her mother, Doria Ragland, was a beautiful bride as she walked down the aisle to wed her royal fianc\u00e9 in an elegant service fit for a princess.", "images":
