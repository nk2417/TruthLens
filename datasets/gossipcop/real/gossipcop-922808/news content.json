To be famous and in a relationship is even more difficult because you have, like, teams and people and everybody feeding ya'll both stuff and then you wind up arguing about things that you wouldn't usually argue about. But I love him. I really love him. I miss him. I think about him every day.\"\n\n\"But to say that I'm single\u2014I can't say that I'm single because in my heart, I still love him,\" she said. \"For me to say I'm single means I want to go out and find something else, like I'm ready to mingle, and I'm not. My heart is still with him. So, hopefully we can work it out but if we can't, the love is still there so, you know, we'll hopefully be able to be friends.\"", "images": ["https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/advertss/1750170051.jpeg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/GettyImages-2148362767 (1)_1763369805.jpg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/images/icon_share.png", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/cover7_1763382230.jpg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/WhatsApp Image 2025-11-18 at 21.20.42_1763497276.jpeg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/images/icon_search.png", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/Screenshot_20251117_204326_Instagram_1763409122.jpg", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/16/23/103930499-15296591-image-a-17_1763335856291.jpg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/advertss/1519058548.jpg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/img/default_avatar.png                                                ", "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/17/10/103939877-0-image-a-22_1763376282916.jpg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/images/icon_close.png", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/advertss/1757697358.jpg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/advertss/1556264601.JPG", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/advertss/1750544903.jpeg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/advertss/1747242976.jpg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/img/loading2.gif", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/Screenshot_20251119_082719_Facebook_1763537396.jpg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/WhatsApp Image 2025-11-17 at 19.51.51 (1)_1763405547.jpeg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/instagram.png", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/advertss/1733234956.png", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/advertss/1556264736.JPG", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/img/loading.gif", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/kwara_1763498204.png", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/images/wink.png", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/advertss/1748031037.jpg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/Ned_Nwoko_1763396330.jpg", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/nicki-minaj-mike-waltz-2025-billboard-1800.jpg?w=942&h=628&crop=1&resize=681%2C454", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/advertss/1762790005.png", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/Screenshot 2025-11-18 161150_1763482318.png", "https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/5ab637c440bf2.jpg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/5ab637c440bf2.jpg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/advertss/1763033303.jpg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/advertss/1761396722.jpeg", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/img/advert.png", "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/img/oplay.png"], "top_img": "https://alexis.lindaikejisblog.com/photos/shares/5ab637c440bf2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.lindaikejisblog.com/2018/3/i-cant-say-that-im-single-amber-rose-reacts-to-21-savage-split-rumors-confirms-they-are-having-issues-2.html", "title": "\"I can't say that I'm single\" -
