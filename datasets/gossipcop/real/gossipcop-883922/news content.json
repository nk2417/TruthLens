A growing roster of celebrities are stepping up to humiliate themselves for a good cause: John Oliver, Judd Apatow and Sarah Silverman are just a few famous faces sharing their awkward years as part of the #PuberMe challenge, launched when Nick Kroll and Stephen Colbert shared photos from their teen years.\n\nColbert\u2019s AmeriCone Dream Fund has offered to donate $1000 for every awkward picture tweeted and/or Instagrammed by a celebrity with the #PuberMe and #PuertoRicoRelief hashtags. The money will go to One America Appeal, an organization started by five living former American Presidents to encourage their fellow citizens to support recovery efforts from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.\n\nIn a time when people in power, particularly in the U.S. should be reaching out and helping Puerto Rico and the Caribbean in the wake of devastation left by Hurricane Irma and Maria instead of tweeting negativity, many are stepping up and doing what they can for relief \u2014 including celebrities. Many are using their platform to send money and aid. Jennifer Lopez donated $1 million and continues to support while Beyonce lent her voice to a remix of J Balvin and Willy William\u2019s \u201cMi Gente\u201d with the proceeds from the song going to hurricane relief efforts.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe #PuberMe campaign is a positive and lighthearted way to bring awareness and aid to Puerto Rico and everyone affected by the recent hurricanes.\n\nAfter Colbert and Kroll shared their pics, others started rolling in. This included enjoyable snapshots of Kroll\u2019s Oh Hello and Big Mouth co-star John Mulaney and Sarah Silverman. Judd Apatow\u2019s is reminiscent of Freaks and Geeks while Steve Martin\u2019s is very\u2026beardy.\n\nNick Kroll asked me to post a pic of my awkward stage, but I never had one. So here's me lookin' cool as hell! #PuberMe #PuertoRicoRelief pic.twitter.com/UC9a7XtjZa \u2014 Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) September 28, 2017\n\nThank you Stephen.
