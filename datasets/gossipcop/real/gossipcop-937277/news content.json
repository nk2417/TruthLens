French authorities have since opened an investigation into the 59-year-old French director after the new report from Europe 1 surfaced. The actress\u2014who has purportedly known Besson for years\u2014has remained anonymous.\n\nThe actress said that while she and Besson were meeting at the luxury hotel Le Bristol in Paris, the director put something in her tea. She later felt out of it and lost consciousness. When she woke up, she alleged that he was touching and penetrating her. She also reported that the director left the hotel before her and left her with a number of outstanding bills. Afterwards, she went to a friend's house to feel more secure.\n\nBesson\u2019s lawyer, Thierry Marembert told The Hollywood Reporter on Saturday, \u201cMr. Besson fell from his chair when he learned of these accusations, which he flatly denies.\u201d\n\nBesson is a world-renowned actor who has won a BAFTA award and earned 10 C\u00e9sar nominations. He directed 1997's The Fifth Element, 2014's Lucy, and 2017's Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, and produced the Taken trilogy.
