He also revealed some secrets and explicit photos of the model online.\n\nABC\u2019s Nightline aired an interview with the model and she explained how she felt when her estranged partner shared her nude pictures on Instagram.\n\n\u201cI was devastated. I\u2019m looking at this and I\u2019m like, \u2018How could someone do this to me?'\u201d she confessed. \u201cI was very fearful because I was like, \u2018If you could do this, what else could you do?'\u201d\n\nChyna stood up for herself saying that her past as a stripper is irrelevant. \u201cJust because of something that I used to do, I shouldn\u2019t be bullied to say, \u2018OK, well, you used to do this, so you deserve that,\u201d.\n\n[ad]\n\n\u201cJust because of something that I used to do, I shouldn\u2019t be bullied to say, \u2018OK, well, you used to do this, so you deserve that,\u201d She told Good Morning America.\n\nWhen she sent the photos to Rob, she did not consent to him posting or sharing for others to see. \u201cThe moral of the story is, like, he doesn\u2019t respect me,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if you can\u2019t respect me, you have to respect the law.\u201d In the interview, Chyna also repeated new claims of Rob being physically violent with her and making multiple suicide threats over the past few months. In the interview, Chyna also repeated new claims of Rob being physically violent with her and making multiple suicide threats over the past few months. \u201cRob has hit me before. Yes, this was in April.\u201dHe threatened to kill himself multiple times in text messages since we broke up in December 2016, trying to manipulate me to respond to his outbursts. I have been telling Rob to get help and go to therapy since June 2016. To my knowledge, Rob has not seen a licensed therapist.\u201dI am in fear of this angry, volatile, vindictive man, who has physically attacked me and tried to humiliate me so publicly. I am embarrassed by his posts. I ask for orders of protection so that I can live my life in peace and free of fear of him.\u201d After the interview was recorded, Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order against Rob. Another court date has been scheduled for August.In spite of the troubles, Chyna hoped to work things out with Rob for the sake of their 8-month old daughter Dream Kardashian.", "images": ["https://guardian.ng/wp-content/themes/guardian_ng/assets/build/images/logo.png", "https://cdn.guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Blac-Chyna.jpg", "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/themes/guardian_ng/assets/build/images/glife.png", "https://cdn.guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Guardian-grey.jpg", "https://cdn.guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Blac-Chyna-1062x598.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/91bb7d28841217d726990bed99dba3a4?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "https://guardian.ng/wp-content/themes/guardian_ng/assets/build/images/letters.png", "https://cdn.guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5a902dbf7f96951c82922875.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.guardian.ng/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Blac-Chyna.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Yvonne Ejiofor", "Guardian Life"], "canonical_link": "https://guardian.ng/life/life-features/blac-chyna-fears-robs-next-move/", "title": "Blac Chyna Fears Rob's Next Move", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Blac Chyna Fears Rob's Next Move", "description": "Rob Kardashian took to Instagram last week to share his story of the messy split between himself and popular model/reality tv star Blac Chyna.
