Huge. I put trust in the hands of someone that took advantage of a young girl years ago.\n\n\u201cIt was my mistake and I\u2019ll always take responsibility - but the one thing that was the hardest was thinking \u2018my husband is gonna leave me, my family will disown me\u2019.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019m blessed beyond words to have a family and a husband that stuck by me because they know who I am. They know I\u2019m not a bad person and they held my hands through hell.\n\nView 4 Images Paige hopes to make a return to the ring (Image: \u00a9 WWE)\n\n\u201cBecause as my husband says, \u2018you may feel like the devil is throwing you into a storm, but just remember, you are the storm\u2019.\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"And he's right. But we are human. Unfortunately people don't see it that way when they are behind a keyboard.\n\n\"They don't think that we have feelings or that we don't suffer. Not only was I a victim of viral humiliation but a victim of cyber bullying. I had days where I wanted to physically harm myself.\"", "images": ["https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article6887021.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Paige-Charlotte.jpg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/ipso.svg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/trust-project.svg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/nav-web-static/release-v41-14493b7c888038a7d89b99cb3a7937c2b71eaebe/public/logo-reach.png", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article10050384.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/WWE-RAW-Pre-Show-Red-Carpet.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article6796028.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/PAIG_05062014lr_0061.jpg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/assets/mirror/logos/masthead-mirror-default.svg", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201704/1586/4221396001_5392406237001_5392398527001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article10050385.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/WWE-Tough-Enough-Season-6.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article10050385.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/WWE-Tough-Enough-Season-6.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article10050385.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/WWE-Tough-Enough-Season-6.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marc Isaacs", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/wrestling/wwe-star-paige-reveals-reason-10261868", "title": "WWE star Paige reveals reason behind 60-day suspension and says 'I don't do drugs' as she looks to get career back on track", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"page_id": 6149699161, "app_id": 123792601022133, "pages": 1814357575554395}, "description": "Paige denies being suspended for taking PEDs and says she passed all the tests but failed to do it in the allocated time", "author": "Marc Isaacs", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "Googlebot-News": "noarchive", "referrer": "unsafe-URL", "keywords": "WWE", "news_keywords": "WWE", "allowTaboolaDeepDive": "true", "vf": {"00000000-0000-4000-8000-67e599051dc3": "mirror-prod-10261868"}, "og": {"title": "WWE star Paige insists 'I don't do drugs'", "description": "Paige denies being suspended for taking PEDs and says she passed all the tests but failed to do it in the allocated time", "url": "http://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/wrestling/wwe-star-paige-reveals-reason-10261868", "site_name": "Daily Mirror", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article10050385.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/WWE-Tough-Enough-Season-6.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-04-20T12:26:01Z", "modified_time": "2017-04-20T12:26:13Z", "author": "Marc Isaacs", "section": "Wrestling", "tag": "WWE"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@DailyMirror", "creator": "@DailyMirror", "title": "WWE star Paige reveals reason behind 60-day suspension and says 'I don't do drugs' as she looks to get career back on track - The Mirror", "description": "Paige denies being suspended for taking PEDs and says she passed all the tests but failed to do it in the allocated time", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article10050385.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/WWE-Tough-Enough-Season-6.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492691161.0, "source": "https://www.mirror.co.uk", "summary": ""}
