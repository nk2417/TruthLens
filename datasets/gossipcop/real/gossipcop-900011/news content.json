Huge spoilers for the latest episode of Riverdale lie ahead.\n\nNetflix // The CW\n\nWhat to Read Next\n\nAfter what feels like months \u2013 maybe even years \u2013 of speculation and mystery, the identity of Riverdale's notorious serial killer, the Black Hood, has finally been revealed.\n\nWell, at least one of them has, anyway.\n\nYes, in last night's (May 9) episode, it was finally confirmed \u2013 as fans, plus Betty Cooper and Cheryl Blossom, expected \u2013 that Betty's dad Hal was the Black Hood.\n\nAlthough Hal told Betty and his wife Alice that he was not the man wielding the gun in last week's episode, he did (attempt) to explain the reason for his deadly deeds.\n\nThe CW\n\nRelated: Who will die in Riverdale's \"tragic\" finale? We examine the likely candidates\n\nFortunately for them, Hal was arrested and locked up before his vengeful plan of punishing the sinners of Riverdale was enacted \u2013 but is this really the end of the Cooper patriarch?\n\nWell, it doesn't sound like it, as the Black Hood actor himself Lochlyn Munro has told Entertainment Weekly that he has \"more to do\" in Riverdale.\n\n\"Right away, I thought I was done. I thought, 'OK, so that's my last season of Riverdale and my last two episodes,'\" he conceded.\n\n\"And [showrunner] Roberto [Aguirre-Sacasa] came up to me and adamantly said, 'No, it's not over [for] Hal. We have a whole different story arc planned for that.'\"\n\nTeasing a whole new era for Hal in season three, Munro added: \"I'm really excited to see what they come up with, so I can really jump into it. Because I now have really embraced this situation with him, and I want to see why he became the guy he is.\n\n\"It gives me more to do, and I look forward to it.\"\n\nRelated Story 6 unanswered questions from Riverdale season 2 so far\n\nRiverdale airs on The CW in the US and Netflix in the UK, with season one also currently showing on 5STAR.\n\nWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?
