It also appeared to spark snickers from some of the players, late-night host Jimmy Kimmel and others in the crowd at Los Angeles\u2019 Staples Center.\n\nNumerous viewers hit Twitter to share their opinions, with a few calling it the \u201cworst rendition ever\u201d (though one argued that Roseanne Barr\u2019s intentionally bad performance at a 1990 San Diego Padres baseball game was worse).\n\nSee some of the reactions below.\n\nOmg. Omg. Omg. Neither Joel Embiid, Draymond Green nor Jimmy Kimmel were enjoying one bit of Fergie\u2019s rendition of the National Anthem. I am screaming. #NBAAllStar pic.twitter.com/FuhKVMIoNX \u2014 Chovan (@thechovanone) February 19, 2018\n\nDon\u2019t let Fergie\u2019s National Anthem performance distract you from the fact that the Golden State Warriors blew a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals despite having the first ever unanimous MVP and going 73-9 in the regular season. \u2014 CAVS (@jackie_kisley) February 19, 2018\n\nMy ear after listening to Fergie \u201csing\u201d that pic.twitter.com/w4pgp1PU6W \u2014 Roff-A (@MJK_NY31) February 19, 2018\n\nLiterally dying at these reactions.

I\u2019m a fan but to be honest, that was horrible! Actually probably one of the worst.

If it topped this hot mess it really was \u2018the worst rendition ever\u2019. #NBAAllStar pic.twitter.com/SDP0CI160F \u2014 LisaMarie (@indianaoldsoul) February 19, 2018\n\nBarr herself also weighed in:", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fergie_0.jpg?w=928&h=523&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fergie_0.jpg?w=928&h=523&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thr Staff", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/viewers-slam-fergies-national-anthem-performance-at-nba-all-star-game-as-worst-rendition-ever-1086009/", "title": "Viewers Slam Fergie\u2019s National Anthem Performance at NBA All-Star Game as \u201cWorst Rendition Ever\u201d", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Some of the players, Jimmy Kimmel and others in the crowd at Sunday's game appeared to snicker.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "THR Staff", "tags": "Fergie", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Viewers Slam Fergie\u2019s National Anthem Performance at NBA All-Star Game as \u201cWorst Rendition Ever\u201d", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/viewers-slam-fergies-national-anthem-performance-at-nba-all-star-game-as-worst-rendition-ever-1086009/", "description": "Some of the players, Jimmy Kimmel and others in the crowd at Sunday's game appeared to snicker.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fergie_0.jpg?w=928&h=523&crop=1", "width": 928, "height": 523, "alt": "Viewers Slam Fergie's National Anthem Performance at NBA All-Star"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-18T18:11:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-20T14:34:47+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Some of the players, Jimmy Kimmel and others in the crowd at Sunday's game appeared to snicker.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Viewers Slam Fergie\u2019s National Anthem Performance at NBA All-Star Game as \u201cWorst Rendition Ever\u201d", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/fergie_0.jpg?w=928&h=523&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518977476.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
