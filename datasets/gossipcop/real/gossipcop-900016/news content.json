It all comes down to your family, and working hard to love and protect and do everything you can to make your family and the ones you love, their lives better.\"\n\nJasmine, who turns 2 on Saturday, then sweetly said \"I love you\" into the mic.\n\n\"When I was 15 years old, I was evicted, we were evicted out of our one bedroom apartment in Honolulu, Hawaii,\" he continued about his past struggles. \"We were forced to leave the island, and here we are today.\"\n\n\"I heard a quote when I was 15, and I thought, if I'm ever in a position one day, I'd like to be able to live this quote, 'It's nice to be important, but it's more important to be nice,'\" continued Johnson, who also gave a shout out to his 16-year-old daughter, Simone, who missed the ceremony on Wednesday. \"With that, I love you and I thank you.\"\n\nJohnson then posed with his girlfriend, Lauren Hashian, and Jasmine, for a sweet family portrait with his star.\n\nJB Lacroix/ WireImage\n\nThe Rock, who recently announced that he was expecting his second daughter with Hashian, opened up to ET's Carly Steel about fatherhood.\n\n\"I'll take the [cool dad] points where I can, because I have three girls now, and estrogen all around me,\" he joked.\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-12/1280_dwayne_johnson_getty887905178.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-12/dwayne_johnson_lauren_hashian_getty890643372.jpg?h=94128b5d&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/gettyimages-891760202.jpg?h=988b456f", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/gettyimages-891760202.jpg?h=988b456f&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-12/dwayne_johnson_nick_jonas_getty_images.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/gettyimages-891760202.jpg?h=988b456f", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/dwayne-johnsons-adorable-daughter-jasmine-steals-the-show-at-his-hollywood-walk-of-fame-ceremony", "title": "Dwayne Johnson's Adorable Daughter Jasmine Steals the Show at His Hollywood Walk of Fame Ceremony", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/gettyimages-891760202.jpg?h=988b456f", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The actor gave a touching speech reflecting on his past struggles and how he got to where they are today.", "title": "Dwayne Johnson's Adorable Daughter Jasmine Steals the Show at His Hollywood Walk of Fame Ceremony", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/dwayne-johnsons-adorable-daughter-jasmine-steals-the-show-at-his-hollywood-walk-of-fame-ceremony", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The actor gave a touching speech reflecting on his past struggles and how he got to where they are today.", "twitter": {"description": "The actor gave a touching speech reflecting on his past struggles and how he got to where they are today.", "title": "Dwayne Johnson's Adorable Daughter Jasmine Steals the Show at His Hollywood Walk of Fame Ceremony", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/dwayne-johnsons-adorable-daughter-jasmine-steals-the-show-at-his-hollywood-walk-of-fame-ceremony", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-12/gettyimages-891760202.jpg?h=988b456f", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Dwayne Johnson's Adorable Daughter Jasmine Steals the Show at His Hollywood Walk of Fame Ceremony | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Dwayne Johnson", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
