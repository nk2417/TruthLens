News, \u201cI think she\u2019s done, yeah.\u201d\n\nRecounting the tension between Zolciak-Biermann and her longtime rival NeNe Leakes while filming the most recent RHOA season reunion, Cohen added, \u201c[Kim] walked out of that reunion and I said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ve seen the last of that wig at these reunions.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThough a rep for Bravo previously had no comment to PEOPLE, casting decisions are typically made after a season\u2019s reunion wraps.\n\nMoses Robinson/Bravo\n\nKim Zolciak-Biermann, Andy Cohen and NeNe Leakes\n\nZolciak-Biermann was one of the original Atlanta Housewives when the show first premiered in October 2008, before deciding to leave RHOA halfway through season 5.\n\n\u201c[RHOA] can be very combative. A lot of negativity,\u201d she told PEOPLE in July, when looking back on her time on the show. \u201cI just was extremely frustrated \u2014 it just was really a trying season for me. I had had enough.\u201d\n\nBut after years of being away from RHOA, Zolciak-Biermann returned to the show for Shere\u00e9 Whitfield\u2019s housewarming party at the season 9 finale \u2014 where she quickly butted heads with Kenya Moore.\n\nAsked at the time if she would consider rejoining the show for its 10th season, Zolciak-Biermann told PEOPLE she would consider it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very motivated by money,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything has a price. I\u2019m just giving it to you straight. Given the right amount of money for anything? Yeah, count me in. I like to work. I have six children to support, so for sure!\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

The most explosive incident came when Zolciak-Biermann said Leakes was \u201csick and disgusting\u201d and lived in a \u201croach nest,\u201d which came to be known as #RoachGate.\n\nLeakes responded with her own slams, calling Zolciak-Biermann \u201cracist\u201d and claiming she and her daughter Brielle \u201cdon\u2019t like black people.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: RHOA\u2019s Kim Zolciak Says She Received Death Threats After NeNe Leakes Called Her \u2018Racist\u2019\n\nIn a preview for Sunday\u2019s RHOA season 10 reunion part 2, Zolciak-Biermann and Leakes face off about their troubles in a heated battle that appears to lead to Zolciak-Biermann walking off the reunion stage in anger.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta reunion part 2 airs Sunday (8 p.m. ET) on Bravo", "images":
