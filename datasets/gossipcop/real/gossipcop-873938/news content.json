According to M:I6 director Christopher McQuarrie, Cruise didn\u2019t miss the mark and was always supposed to hit the wall. However, on the fourth take, Cruise hit at a slightly different angle and broke his ankle.\n\nMcQuarrie also tweeted that \u201cTom is on the mend.\u201d He also offered assurances that the film will meet its release date. Separately, McQuarrie explained the details of the stunt in an interview with Empire.\n\nA source told The Hollywood Reporter that production would be delayed by eight to nine weeks due to the incident.\n\nThe accident, which took place on the roof of Baynard House, an office block in the Blackfriars district of London, occurred Saturday. Sources say this was day 88 of the Mission: Impossible 6 shoot, which was due to carry on for another two months and into October.\n\nProducers are keeping stages at the busy Leavesdon studios outside of London on hold to ensure they have them available when production starts again.\n\nMission: Impossible 6 also stars Henry Cavill, Rebecca Ferguson, Angela Bassett and Alec Baldwin.\n\nThe 55-year-old actor has a history of performing difficult stunts, with his Mission: Impossible \u2014 Rogue Nation plane sequence even serving as a key point in the film\u2019s marketing. The opening scene featured Cruise\u2019s Ethan Hunt hanging on to an Airbus 400 as it taxies down a runway and eventually takes off.\n\nPamela McClintock contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mi5-12003r_59affd4ff9652066f85d9b6dd211b9e7b074871c_copy_-_h_2017_0.jpg?w=768&h=433&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mi5-12003r_59affd4ff9652066f85d9b6dd211b9e7b074871c_copy_-_h_2017_0.jpg?w=768&h=433&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Ritman Jackie Strause", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/mission-impossible-6-hiatus-tom-cruise-breaks-ankle-1030145/", "title": "\u2018Mission: Impossible 6\u2019 Shoot on Hiatus After Tom Cruise Breaks Ankle", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "&quot;Tom wants to thank you all for your concern and support and can't wait to share the film with everyone next summer,&quot; Paramount said Wednesday, adding that the movie's release date remains the same.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Alex Ritman,Jackie Strause", "tags": "Tom Cruise", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Mission: Impossible 6\u2019 Shoot on Hiatus After Tom Cruise Breaks Ankle", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/mission-impossible-6-hiatus-tom-cruise-breaks-ankle-1030145/", "description": "\"Tom wants to thank you all for your concern and support and can't wait to share the film with everyone next summer,\" Paramount said Wednesday, adding that the movie's release date remains the same.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mi5-12003r_59affd4ff9652066f85d9b6dd211b9e7b074871c_copy_-_h_2017_0.jpg?w=768&h=433&crop=1", "width": 768, "height": 433, "alt": "Tom Cruise Breaks Ankle in 'Mission: Impossible 6' Stunt"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-16T10:16:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-29T07:50:35+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Tom wants to thank you all for your concern and support and can't wait to share the film with everyone next summer,\" Paramount said Wednesday, adding that the movie's release date remains the same.", "site": "@thr", "creator": "@alexritman", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Mission: Impossible 6\u2019 Shoot on Hiatus After Tom Cruise Breaks Ankle", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/mi5-12003r_59affd4ff9652066f85d9b6dd211b9e7b074871c_copy_-_h_2017_0.jpg?w=768&h=433&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502878615.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
