The outlet additionally claimed that disgraced Prince Andrew and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, would be among those guests invited to the memorial.\n\nHowever, a palace source tells Bazaar.com that those rumors are \u201cinaccurate.\u201d\n\n\u201c[There are] no plans for any public event\u2014or indeed for any private family gathering\u2014to mark the anniversary,\u201d the source says. \u201cReports today suggesting otherwise are inaccurate.\u201d\n\nThe insider explained that, instead of a public memorial, King Charles II and Queen Camilla plan to spend the day \u201cquietly and privately,\u201d the same way Queen Elizabeth spent anniversaries of the death of her father, King George VI.\n\nWhile we don\u2019t yet know how Harry and Meghan plan to spend the anniversary of the queen\u2019s death, the couple will be close to their former home base as they attend the sixth Invictus Games in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. The blowout sports event will take place from September 9 to 16.", "images":
