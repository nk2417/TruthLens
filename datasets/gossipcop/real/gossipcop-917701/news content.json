The show has been held annually since 1975,[1][2] with the winners originally determined using Gallup Polls until a switch to online voting in 2005.\n\nThe awards were created by Bob Stivers, who produced the first show in 1975.[3][4] The first awards recognized The Sting as Favorite Picture of 1974, Barbra Streisand as the year's Favorite Film Actress, and John Wayne as its Favorite Film Actor.[5] So far, Ellen DeGeneres and Taylor Swift are the most awarded people, with a total of 20 awards each.[6]\n\nIn 1982, Stivers sold the People's Choice Awards to Procter & Gamble Productions (P&G); under P&G, the ceremony was broadcast by CBS, and Procter & Gamble's brands held exclusive national advertising time across the entire telecast.[7][8]\n\nIn April 2017, the E! network announced that they had acquired the People's Choice Awards.[7][8] The ceremony was initially shifted from a January scheduling to November to reduce its proximity to the busier months of awards season,[9][10][11] but this was reverted for 2024 with a move to February.[12] Since 2021, the ceremony has aired on E!'s sister broadcast network NBC.[13] In September 2023, NBC also began to host the People's Choice Country Awards as a spin-off.\n\nCategories [ edit ]\n\nThe award categories have varied over the years. For example, the 16th People's Choice Awards had categories including Favorite All-Around Movie (Batman), and both a Favorite Movie Actor (Tom Cruise) and a World Favorite Movie Actor (Dustin Hoffman). At the 23rd People's Choice Awards, Rob Reiner was named the People's Choice Awards Honoree. The 32nd People's Choice Awards (broadcast in January 2006) included categories such as Favorite On-Screen Match-Up (Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in Wedding Crashers), Favorite Leading Lady (Reese Witherspoon), Favorite Tour (U2), and an award named after a Procter & Gamble brand: Nice 'n Easy Fans Favorite Hair (Faith Hill). In 2008, the People's Choice Awards introduced a new category: Favorite Sci-Fi Show. The nominees were Stargate Atlantis, Battlestar Galactica, and Doctor Who. Stargate Atlantis was the first recipient of the award.\n\nPoll-based awards [ edit ]\n\nIn the 20th century, the awards were based on results from Gallup polls. Each year, Gallup took a survey of different categories for favorite actor, actress, movie, artist, television program or group. The scope was unlimited\u2014the public could choose whomever or whatever it liked. The results of the annual survey were announced in the form of the People's Choice Awards. Since polls have margins of error, many years' awards have had ties in at least one category, when Gallup declared that the voting was so close that a single winner could not be chosen. For instance, in 2003, both Spider-Man and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring were recognized as Favorite Motion Picture.\n\nSwitch to online voting [ edit ]\n\nThe winners of the 31st People's Choice Awards (on January 9, 2005) were decided by online voting rather than Gallup polls. The nominees submitted for Internet voting were selected using an unpublished process involving editors at Entertainment Weekly, the show's production team and a panel of pop culture fans.\n\nThe nominees for the 32nd People's Choice Awards were determined by the web research company Knowledge Networks, which took a nationally representative sample of men and women ages 18 to 54, with and without Internet access, to come up with the nominees. After being presented with a list of candidates determined by national ratings averages, box office grosses and album sales, they had the option to write in their favorites. Knowledge Networks recruits its panel by using a RDD phone recruitment method and provides a web TV and Internet access to households without Internet access enabling them to infer back to the entire population.\n\nThe nominees for the 2010 People's Choice Awards were determined by the media research company Visible Measures, which specializes in measuring Internet video audience behavior. The announcement of this partnership stated,\n\n\"For the first time ever, the People's Choice Awards has incorporated Internet video viewing data into the initial nominee selection process, depending on Visible Measures True Reach metrics to objectively measure online video popularity. [...] Visible Measures worked with the People's Choice Awards to determine each potential nominees' popularity on a True Reach basis, a unique measure of the total audience that has been exposed to an online video campaign \u2013 regardless of how widely the campaign spreads or where it appears. To measure True Reach, Visible Measures deploys a robust and patented set of technologies with the goal of capturing the universe of Internet video viewership data in near real-time.\"[14]\n\nFormer categories [ edit ]\n\nThese are some of the past categories for the People's Choice Awards:[15][16]\n\nMovies [ edit ] Favorite Movie\n\nFavorite Movie Actor\n\nFavorite Movie Actress\n\nFavorite Action Movie\n\nFavorite Action Movie Actor\n\nFavorite Action Movie Actress\n\nFavorite Animated Movie\n\nFavorite Animated Movie Voice\n\nFavorite Cast [ 17 ]\n\nFavorite Comedy Movie\n\nFavorite Comedic Movie Actor\n\nFavorite Comedic Movie Actress\n\nFavorite Dramatic Movie\n\nFavorite Dramatic Movie Actor\n\nFavorite Dramatic Movie Actress\n\nFavorite Family Movie\n\nFavorite Horror Movie\n\nFavorite Thriller Movie\n\nFavorite Year End Movie\n\nFavorite Year-End Blockbuster\n\nFavorite Sci-Fi/Fantasy Movie\n\nFavorite Movie Icon\n\nFavorite Movie Duo\n\nFavorite Movie Fan Following\n\nFavorite Movie Franchise\n\nFavorite Movie Superhero\n\nFavorite Face of Heroism\n\nFavorite On Screen Movie Chemistry\n\nFavorite Book Adaptation\n\nFavorite Movie Star Under 25\n\nFavorite Independent Movie\n\nFavorite Breakout Movie Actor\n\nFavorite Breakout Movie Actress\n\nFavorite On Screen Team Digital [ edit ] Favorite Comedic Collaboration\n\nFavorite Online Sensation\n\nFavortie User-Generated Video\n\nFavorite Social Media Celebrity\n\nFavorite Social Media Star\n\nFavorite Viral Video Star\n\nFavorite Mobile Game\n\nFavorite Video Game\n\nFavorite YouTube Star\n\nFavorite Star Under 35\n\nFavorite Web Celeb\n\nCBS.com's Favorite Digital Obsession\n\nThe DailyMail.com Seriously Popular Award Music [ edit ] Favorite Song\n\nFavorite Album\n\nFavorite Remake\n\nFavorite Male Singer\n\nFavorite Female Singer\n\nFavorite Male Musical Performer\n\nFavorite Female Musical Performer\n\nFavorite All Time Musical Performer\n\nFavorite Musical Group or Band\n\nFavorite Music Video\n\nFavorite Song from a Movie\n\nFavorite Tour\n\nFavorite Tour Headliner\n\nFavorite Pop Song\n\nFavorite Rock Song\n\nFavorite Hip-Hop Song\n\nFavorite R&B Song\n\nFavorite Country Song\n\nFavorite Song from a Soundtrack\n\nFavorite Group\n\nFavorite Combined Forces\n\nFavorite Breakout Music Artist\n\nFavorite Rock Band\n\nFavorite Pop Artist\n\nFavorite Country Artist\n\nFavorite Country Group\n\nFavorite R&B Artist\n\nFavorite Hip-Hop Artist\n\nFavorite Male Artist\n\nFavorite Female Artist\n\nFavorite Male Country Artist\n\nFavorite Female Country Artist\n\nFavorite Music Icon\n\nFavorite Music Collaboration\n\nFavorite Alternative/Rock Band\n\nFavorite Rock Group Television [ edit ] Favorite TV Show\n\nFavorite TV Comedy\n\nFavorite TV Drama\n\nFavorite Male TV Performer\n\nFavorite Female TV Performer\n\nFavorite Male Performer In A New TV Series\n\nFavorite Female Performer In A New TV Series\n\nFavorite Network TV Comedy\n\nFavorite Comedy TV Actor\n\nFavorite Comedy TV Actress\n\nFavorite Network TV Drama\n\nFavorite Dramatic TV Actor\n\nFavorite Dramatic TV Actress\n\nFavorite Cable TV Comedy\n\nFavorite Cable TV Drama\n\nFavorite Cable TV Actor\n\nFavorite Cable TV Actress\n\nFavorite Premium Cable TV Show\n\nFavorite Premium Cable TV Actor\n\nFavorite Premium Cable TV Actress\n\nFavorite TV Crime Drama\n\nFavorite Horror Show\n\nFavorite Crime Drama TV Actor\n\nFavorite Crime Drama TV Actress\n\nFavorite Network Sci-Fi/Fantasy Show\n\nFavorite Cable Sci-Fri/Fantasy Show\n\nFavorite Sci-Fi/Fantasy Actor\n\nFavorite Sci-Fi/Fantasy Actress\n\nFavorite Competition TV Show\n\nFavorite Daytime TV Host\n\nFavorite Daytime TV Hosting Team\n\nFavorite Late Night Talk Show Host\n\nFavorite Streaming Series\n\nFavorite TV Bromance\n\nFavorite TV Gal Pals\n\nFavorite TV Movie/Miniseries\n\nFavorite TV Anti-Hero\n\nFavorite TV Hero\n\nFavorite TV Icon\n\nFavorite TV Duo\n\nFavorite TV Character We Miss Most\n\nFavorite Actor in a New TV Series\n\nFavorite Actress in a New TV Series\n\nFavorite Animated TV Show\n\nFavorite Cartoon Show\n\nFavorite New TV Comedy\n\nFavorite New TV Drama\n\nFavorite On Screen TV Chemistry\n\nFavorite Series We Miss Most\n\nFavorite New Talk Show Host\n\nFavorite Celebrity Judge\n\nFavorite TV Celebreality Star\n\nFavorite TV Guest Star\n\nFavorite TV Fan Following\n\nFavorite Scene Stealing Star\n\nFavorite Scene Stealing Guest Star\n\nFavorite Game Show\n\nFavorite Competition/Reality Show\n\nFavorite TV Obsession\n\nFavorite TV Chef\n\nFavorite TV Guilty Pleasure\n\nFavorite Family TV Movie\n\nFavorite Sketch Comedy TV Show\n\nCurrent categories [ edit ]\n\nThe first ceremony in 1975 had 14 categories.
