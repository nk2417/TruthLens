Huffington Post was the first to report Carlson\u2019s new position.\n\nCarlson is joining the organization amid a recent controversy of leaked internal emails from Miss America leaders, including now-former CEO Sam Haskell, which crudely discussed the appearances of women who had competed in the pageant with demeaning and misogynistic language. Carlson confirmed Huffington Post\u2019s report of her new position and tweeted, \u201cHonored to move this iconic program forward with so many amazing volunteers.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone has been stunned by the events of the last several days, and this has not been easy for anyone who loves this program. In the end, we all want a strong, relevant Miss America and we appreciate the existing board taking the steps necessary to quickly begin stabilizing the organization for the future,\u201d said Carlson in a statement from the Miss America Organization.\n\nThe Miss America Organization also announced former Miss Americas Laura Kaeppeler Fleiss (Miss America 2012), Heather French Henry (Miss America 200) and Kate Shindle (Miss America 1998) are joining the board. The group recently told the Associated Press they were seeking the help of former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend the next generation of leaders for the pageant.\n\nA statement from the group also noted that that Carlson will \u201cwork with all Miss America stakeholders, including the organization\u2019s state executive directors and former state titleholders, to continue an ongoing inclusive and transparent process to identify additional new board members and management.\u201d\n\nAfter Haskell\u2019s resignation last week, president and COO Josh Randle and chairman Lynn Weidner also resigned after being revealed to have also exchanged the demeaning emails among the board members.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gretchen_carlson_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gretchen_carlson_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thr Staff", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/gretchen-carlson-serve-as-board-chair-miss-america-organization-email-scandal-1070905/", "title": "Gretchen Carlson to Serve as Board Chair of Miss America Organization After Email Scandal", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The former Miss America and news anchor who settled her sexual harassment lawsuit against then-Fox News chief Roger Ailes for $20 million will head the organization's board of directors amid a recent email scandal where the now-former CEO used crude language to discuss former pageant winners.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "THR Staff", "tags": "Gretchen Carlson", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Gretchen Carlson to Serve as Board Chair of Miss America Organization After Email Scandal", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/gretchen-carlson-serve-as-board-chair-miss-america-organization-email-scandal-1070905/", "description": "The former Miss America and news anchor who settled her sexual harassment lawsuit against then-Fox News chief Roger Ailes for $20 million will head the organization's board of directors amid a recent email scandal where the now-former CEO used crude language to discuss former pageant winners.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gretchen_carlson_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Gretchen Carlson Serve Board Chair of Miss America Organization After Email Scandal"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-01T13:23:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-01T18:42:26+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The former Miss America and news anchor who settled her sexual harassment lawsuit against then-Fox News chief Roger Ailes for $20 million will head the organization's board of directors amid a recent email scandal where the now-former CEO used crude language to discuss former pageant winners.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Gretchen Carlson to Serve as Board Chair of Miss America Organization After Email Scandal", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gretchen_carlson_-_getty_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514813012.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
