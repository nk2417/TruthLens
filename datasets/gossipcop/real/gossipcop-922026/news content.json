A long bumper sticker,\u201d Kimmel said.\n\nPrior to Kimmel\u2019s procedure, Couric poked fun at the late-night host as she challenged the nurses to thoroughly clean his colon enough to find the iTunes gift card she hid inside. \u201cWhoever finds it, it\u2019s yours,\u201d Couric joked.\n\nLater, Kimmel learned that his colonoscopy procedure went smoothly, until Couric admitted that they found some unusual personal items of his along the way such as his car keys, action figures and a harmonica.\n\nWatch the full segment above.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/aca92e16-fa5e-4588-ae85-d8dd862273c3.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/aca92e16-fa5e-4588-ae85-d8dd862273c3.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lexy Perez", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jimmy-kimmel-enlists-help-katie-couric-first-colonoscopy-1096214/", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Enlists Help From Katie Couric for First Colonoscopy", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "After recently turning 50, the late-night host chronicled his first procedure alongside the former 'Today' anchor, who famously filmed her colonscopy years ago.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Lexy Perez", "tags": "Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Katie Couric, Late Night TV", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Enlists Help From Katie Couric for First Colonoscopy", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jimmy-kimmel-enlists-help-katie-couric-first-colonoscopy-1096214/", "description": "After recently turning 50, the late-night host chronicled his first procedure alongside the former 'Today' anchor, who famously filmed her colonscopy years ago.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/aca92e16-fa5e-4588-ae85-d8dd862273c3.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "Jimmy Kimmel Enlists Help From Katie Couric First Colonoscopy"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-21T08:14:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-21T08:40:28+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "After recently turning 50, the late-night host chronicled his first procedure alongside the former 'Today' anchor, who famously filmed her colonscopy years ago.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Enlists Help From Katie Couric for First Colonoscopy", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/aca92e16-fa5e-4588-ae85-d8dd862273c3.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521620077.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
