The ruling came on the heels of Tori and Dean failing to make an appearance for a subpoenaed court hearing last week.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\nThe Beverly Hills 90210 actress and her hubby are fighting a legal battle against City National Bank, who is suing the couple for allegedly failing to pay off a $400k loan from 2010.\n\nThe bank accused Tori and Dean of failing to pay $185,714 plus an additional $2,407 in interest. The company also tacked on another $17,419, an amount that Tori allegedly overdrew this past September and has yet to pay.\n\nUp Next: Watch: Tori Spelling and Jennie Garth Throw Shade at Tiffani Thiessen on \u2018RuPaul\u2019\n\nThis latest lawsuit is only one of many other financial snags that Tori and Dean have run into this past year. Back in April, the IRS reportedly drained both Tori and Dean\u2019s bank accounts.\n\nLast year, the news emerged that the celebrity couple was issued a lien by the state of California for $707,487.30 in unpaid federal taxes for their 2014 bill alone. Tori also reportedly owes more than $87,000 in unpaid credit card debt to American Express.\n\nSpelling has never been shy about discussing her financial issues. In her 2013 memoir Spelling It Like It Is, she spoke out about why she has problems spending too much money.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no mystery why I have money problems. I grew up rich beyond anyone\u2019s wildest dreams. I never knew anything else,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEven when I try to embrace a simpler lifestyle, I can\u2019t seem to let go of my expensive tastes. Even when my tastes aren\u2019t fancy, they\u2019re still costly. I moved houses to simplify my life, but lost almost a million dollars along the way.\u201d\n\nMore: Tori Spelling Reveals New Photo Despite IRS Emptying Account\n\nTo add insult to injury, Dean\u2019s ex-wife, Mary Jo Eustace, is suing him for $100,000 in back child support for their son Jack.\n\nTori, 43, and Dean have five children, Liam, 10, Stella, 8, Hattie, 5, Finn, 4, and now baby son Beau.
