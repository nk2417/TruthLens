Nashville police said Oher pushed and kicked his Uber driver over an apparent dispute over the fare.\n\nOher was represented by attorney Roger May of Nashville.\n\nAccording to Davidson County District Attorney spokeswoman Dorinda Carter, the charge was dismissed with the agreement from the alleged victim.\n\nOher, who has been in the NFL's concussion protocol since September, was released from the Carolina Panthers in July with a failed physical designation.\n\nOher played for the Titans in 2014, before the Titans released him less than one year into a four-year contract. He played his first five NFL seasons with the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nThis is a developing story.
