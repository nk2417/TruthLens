Stream on\n\nBrittany was completely shocked when Jax got down on one knee, and the reactions among the rest of the gang ranged from overwhelming joy from Stassi Schroeder to Kristen Doute actually predicting the engagement as it was taking place. But before she heard the news of the engagement, Katie Maloney-Schwartz wasn't exactly sure now was the right time for Jax to put a ring on it. She said during the episode that she thought it was \"too soon\" for Jax and Brittany to get engaged, citing how they dealt with infidelity in their relationship just last year. \"I can't say that Jax and Brittany have fixed their relationship, but I would not bet on that they had,\" Katie said in an interview during the episode.\n\nRelated\n\nBrittany admitted that it wasn't easy to hear her friend comment on her relationship with Jax that way when she appeared on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen Monday night (clip above). \"Honestly, I was upset to see that, but at the end of the day, I know my friends are trying to look out for me. They were worried about me over everything that happened last year,\" Brittany shared. \"And also, I know that Katie is so happy for us now. She's one of my very best friends. So at the end of the day, I just have to remember the journey that we all took.\"\n\nThe Vanderpump Rules bride also acknowledged that it's going to take some time for everyone to get on board with her engagement, considering everything she and Jax went through last season. \"Obviously, I know all the fans and everything isn't gonna believe our relationship right away and how happy we truly are and how much he's changed right away. I know this,\" Brittany said. \"But he has, and everyone will see it. And at the end of the day, we're happy.\"\n\nWe'll see how the whole SUR squad reacts to Jax and Brittany's engagement in an all-new episode of Vanderpump Rules on Monday at 9/8c.
