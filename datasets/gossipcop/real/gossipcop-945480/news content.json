Low lights include, \"Word of wisdom for the day...if your [sic] fat...don't look in the mirror\" ... and \"Don't tease fat kids, they already have enough on their plates.\"\n\nMelton now says, \"I'm truly sorry for making inconsiderate comments several years ago and apologize to anyone I hurt. What I posted and said was immature, offensive and inappropriate. I am ashamed of how I acted and there is no excuse for that behavior.\"\n\nThe actor was a total unknown back in 2012, which explains the tweets going unnoticed. His first acting gig didn't come until a \"Glee\" role in 2014.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/3d/16by9/2018/06/19/3de7a07ed8ef53f1a38774b332c17d3d_xl.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/f2/o/2018/06/19/f2858f93a41352949f38b92f6db9960c_md.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/thirtymilezone.svg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/5e/16by9/2017/12/23/5e1af9ffa7e751eca012a6418fc491b8_xs.png", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e3/16by9/2025/11/20/e3028a12684b463faee721ff211e9954_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/0f/16by9/2025/11/20/0fe06478a3e241edaa03423e7f006606_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/de/4by3/2025/11/19/def9d7aac6b04006a89c0cf3fb46eb21_xxs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/69/16by9/2017/07/12/69f6323b42df577ab8230b57bb2dde69_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/b4/16by9/2025/11/20/b4fbe4e8e5654748a5497e1a52b939b1_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e4/16by9/2025/11/20/e4ccda421f7140fb91551c634a62d9dc_xs.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/article/google-preferred-source.png", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/72/16by9/2025/11/20/726f88d680674fccaa77ad055cd10d2e_xs.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/3d/16by9/2018/06/19/3de7a07ed8ef53f1a38774b332c17d3d_xl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2018/06/19/riverdale-star-charles-melton-apologizes-fat-shaming-tweets/", "title": "'Riverdale' Star Charles Melton Apologizes for Fat-Shaming Comments", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=0.25,maximum-scale=10", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "google-site-verification": "UUmtbUBf3djgPpCeLefe_PbFsOc6JGxfXmHzpjFLAEQ", "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "p": {"domain_verify": "933e74ace98032aadbc3328616280038"}, "robots": "index,follow,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "description": "'Riverdale' star Charles Melton apologizes for his fat-shaming comments.", "fb": {"app_id": 310610065699820}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tmz"}, "og": {"site_name": "TMZ", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.tmz.com/2018/06/19/riverdale-star-charles-melton-apologizes-fat-shaming-tweets/", "title": "'Riverdale' Star Charles Melton Apologizes for Fat-Shaming Comments", "description": "'Riverdale' star Charles Melton apologizes for his fat-shaming comments.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/3d/16by9/2018/06/19/3de7a07ed8ef53f1a38774b332c17d3d_xl.jpg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TMZ", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Riverdale' Star Charles Melton Apologizes for Fat-Shaming Comments", "description": "'Riverdale' star Charles Melton apologizes for his fat-shaming comments.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/3d/16by9/2018/06/19/3de7a07ed8ef53f1a38774b332c17d3d_xl.jpg"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=299948601, app-argument=https://www.tmz.com/2018/06/19/riverdale-star-charles-melton-apologizes-fat-shaming-tweets/?tmz#article", "application-name": "TMZ.COM", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TMZ.COM", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/msapplication-tile-image-270x270-v1.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.tmz.com/?adid=IE9pin", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#000000", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-tooltip": "TMZ | Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Photos;action-uri=https://www.tmz.com/photos/;icon-uri=https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/favicon-32x32-v1.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529380800.0, "source": "https://www.tmz.com", "summary": ""}
