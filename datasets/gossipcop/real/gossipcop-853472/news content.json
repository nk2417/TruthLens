DADDY I Love You. This is the last pic I have my dad.\u201d\n\nAaron then followed up with an Instagram post that read: \u201cMy heart is broken, We are so hurt we lost you poppa way too soon. You were never human to me, you were always my real life super hero.\u201d\n\nTMZ report that sources close to Robert believe he suffered a heart attack, and that he had \u201ccomplained of chest pains and had twitching in his arm before he went to bed and never woke up\u201d.\n\nThe site reports: \u201cWe\u2019re told he was working a lot around the house and was out in the hot Florida sun when the chest pains started.\u201d\n\nNick made the admission about the poor relationship between him and his parents in the 2015 Backstreets Boy documentary Show \u2018Em What You\u2019re Made Of.\n\nHe said \u201cI haven\u2019t seen them in maybe seven or eight years.\u201d\n\nIt is not known what triggered their feud, but Nick has painted a picture of a very scary childhood in previous interviews and his autobiography.\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt was a house full of fear for me. We would be little kids and we would hear mom and dad screaming at each other.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d constantly be drinking and fighting and we\u2019d hear guns go out the window shooting. Not shooting at each other.\n\n\u201cThey always fought over money.\u201d\n\nHe also told Dr. Phil that finding fame at a young age and being the family breadwinner caused friction.\n\nNick explained: \u201cIt was just the way my household was with my father: he was a dominating personality.\n\n\u201cHe led by fear\u2026 I believe you should lead with love.\n\n\u201cI always had a lot of pressure when it came to my siblings. I became the father\u2026 I was making more money that my father did at the age of 14 or 15. I became the provider.\u201d\n\nNick and Aaron have three sisters, Angel, Bobbie and Leslie \u2013 who died from a suspected drugs overdose in 2012.\n\nNick refused to attend the 25-year-old\u2019s funeral, claiming at the time that his family \u201ccomplicates\u201d things, and later admitting that his family blamed her for his death.\n\nIt is not known if Aaron is still estranged from his mum after he accused her of stealing from him when he was a teen star in a bombshell 2005 interview.\n\nSpeaking to US show 20/20 he said: \u201cEvery show we did, we would probably make about maybe $40,000, $50,000 a show. And it was all gone.\u201d\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/aaron3.png?strip=all&w=917", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/af-composite-carter.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/holly-op-jk.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&1763551153&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/aaron2.png?strip=all&w=588", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tp-Adam-Peaty-1911_COMP.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict0003235687501.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/newspress-collage-p268cpzha-1763555741197.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&1763555778&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nick4.png?strip=all&w=587", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict000324512185.jpg?strip=all&w=640", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ac-18_11-yaz-hadfield-comp.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/aaron1.png?strip=all&w=593"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/af-composite-carter.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3588956/devastated-nick-and-aaron-carter-ask-for-privacy-to-grieve-after-their-father-robert-dies-suddenly-aged-65/", "title": "Devastated Nick and Aaron Carter ask for privacy to grieve after their father Robert dies suddenly aged 65", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
