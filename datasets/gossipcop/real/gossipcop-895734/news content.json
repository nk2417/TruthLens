Simmons and Ratner, she said, after meeting her, invited her to Simmons\u2019 apartment on the pretext of seeing a music video they had produced. As the video played, she said, Simmons began sexually assaulting her, ripping off her clothes, Kelly reported, forcing her to perform oral sex and later intercourse, all in Ratner\u2019s presence.\n\n\u201cI looked over at Brett and asked for help, because I thought he was a friend,\u201d Khalighi told Kelly, before realizing that \u201cthis was their plan all along. There was no help that was gonna come.\u201d Khalighi said that \u201cin the fashion circles it was widely known that they had a reputation for being modelizers\u2026\u201d\n\nSimmons denied the claim of assault to the Los Angeles Times, which first reported the story. In an emotional dialogue this morning between Khalighi and Kelly, the ex-model said that her story was complicated by the fact that after the first assault, she had taken a shower and returned, only to be assaulted by Simmons a second time.\n\n\u201cAfter the oral sex part of the story,\u201d she recalled, \u201cI stayed. I didn\u2019t run out. I stayed and I took a shower and an additional sexual assault happened there.\u201d Women don\u2019t always follow \u201ca cut-and-dried, black-and-white story line\u2026I\u2019ve learned in a lot of the work I\u2019ve done around this issue there\u2019s a whole spectrum, a variety of response of fight, flight or freeze. I certainly froze. I did what I could to normalize what was an incredibly hard-to-process situation in the moment, as a 17-year-old.\u201d\n\nWatch the interview here.", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_02851.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_0289-1-e1511366720472.jpg?w=350", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_0289-1-e1511366720472.jpg?w=350&h=192&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_0289-1-e1511366720472.jpg?w=350", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeremy Gerard", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2017/11/russell-simmons-accuser-megyn-kelly-1202213706/", "title": "Russell Simmons\u2019 Accuser Tells Megyn Kelly \u2018He Actually Apologized\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "UPDATE, with video\u00a0Former model Keri Claussen Khalighi told Megyn Kelly this morning that music mogul Russell Simmons has privately apologized to her for sexually assaulting her, despite his public insistence that what happened in 1991, when she was 17 years old, was consensual.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Jeremy Gerard", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Russell Simmons\u2019 Accuser Tells Megyn Kelly \u2018He Actually Apologized\u2019", "url": "https://deadline.com/2017/11/russell-simmons-accuser-megyn-kelly-1202213706/", "description": "UPDATE, with video\u00a0Former model Keri Claussen Khalighi told Megyn Kelly this morning that music mogul Russell Simmons has privately apologized to her for sexually assaulting her, despite his public insistence that what happened in 1991, when she was 17 years old, was consensual. \u201cRussell and I have actually had a face-to-face confrontation about what happened, [\u2026]", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_0289-1-e1511366720472.jpg?w=350", "width": 2592, "height": 1936, "alt": "Russell Simmons' Accuser Tells Megyn Kelly 'He Actually Apologized'"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-22T15:30:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2024-12-19T00:26:53+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "UPDATE, with video\u00a0Former model Keri Claussen Khalighi told Megyn Kelly this morning that music mogul Russell Simmons has privately apologized to her for sexually assaulting her, despite his public insistence that what happened in 1991, when she was 17 years old, was consensual. \u201cRussell and I have actually had a face-to-face confrontation about what happened, [\u2026]", "site": "@Deadline", "creator": "@jbgerard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Russell Simmons\u2019 Accuser Tells Megyn Kelly \u2018He Actually Apologized\u2019", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/img_0289-1-e1511366720472.jpg?w=350"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511364605.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
