I do not want to see any more families destroyed at the hands of domestic violence and I do not want any more women to suffer like my daughter did. We are here to assist and we hope to hear from Ms. Leal.\u201d\n\nJust last month, Bobby Brown told Rolling Stone he felt justice for his daughter had not yet been served \u2014 and would only be once Gordon was rotting away in jail.\n\n\u201cJustice? If he was locked up somewhere where somebody can rape him. That\u2019s just how I feel,\u201d the singer said. \u201cHe raped me by taking my daughter away.\u201d", "images": ["data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/03/12/SFDRCH5OOOWEFWZ3FH6W6EBDNI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/03/12/SFDRCH5OOOWEFWZ3FH6W6EBDNI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Desantis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/03/11/bobbi-kristina-browns-ex-boyfriend-nick-gordon-arrested-for-domestic-violence-in-florida/", "title": "Bobbi Kristina Brown\u2019s ex-boyfriend Nick Gordon arrested for domestic violence in Florida", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Rachel Desantis", "canonical": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/03/11/bobbi-kristina-browns-ex-boyfriend-nick-gordon-arrested-for-domestic-violence-in-florida/"}, "description": "Nick Gordon, the ex-boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina Brown, was arrested on domestic violence charges for the second time in one year Saturday.", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Bobbi Kristina Brown\u2019s ex-boyfriend Nick Gordon arrested for domestic violence in Florida", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/03/11/bobbi-kristina-browns-ex-boyfriend-nick-gordon-arrested-for-domestic-violence-in-florida/", "description": "Nick Gordon, the former boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina Brown, was arrested on domestic violence charges in Florida Saturday for the second time in a year.
