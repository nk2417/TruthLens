But as anyone who's been following the news knows, Luann's journey has continued beyond the Season 10 finale.\n\nHow to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of New York City on Bravo and Peacock.\n\nThe RHONY cabaret performer checked herself back into an alcohol treatment center in July, right before the taping of this season's reunion. As a result, Luann was not present for the sit-down, the second part of which aired Wednesday night.\n\nHowever, Luann will still have the opportunity to reflect on the season and address her fellow New York Housewives' comments. She's slated to appear on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on Wednesday, September 5 at 11/10c, Andy Cohen announced on Twitter Thursday.\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nBethenny Frankel, who was with Luann when she decided to enter rehab for the second time, explained at the reunion that Luann's recent family drama over the sale of her house in the Hamptons was one of the factors that contributed to her relapse. \"She would want to say that it was the catalyst of her family suing her and that she would never take from her children and that she's not stealing from her children and that she's handling that. She would want everyone to know that,\" Bethenny told the group in regards to what Luann would have said if she were present at the reunion. \"But she would say a bunch of different things. She wanted to be here, believe me.\"\n\n\n\nRelated\n\nAndy shared at the reunion, \"We love Lu, and we're all thinking of her. And we know she'll be back and better than ever.\"\n\nLuann addressed her absence in advance of the airing of Part 1 of the reunion last week. \"Wish I could\u2019ve been there but #Healthfirst,\" she shared on Instagram, along with \"#nevercountoutthecountess,\" a nod to her iconic Season 7 tagline.\n\nCheck out the post on Instagram\n\nLuann said during an interview on Megyn Kelly TODAY earlier this month that she would have liked to address her issues with Dorinda Medley at the reunion. \"Yeah, Dorinda and I are still not cool, which is unfortunate. I love Dorinda, but you know, there are some issues to be addressed, and I hope that we're gonna turn that relationship around because I love Dorinda, I've known her for a long time, so I hope we resolve it,\" she said. \"And I'm sure at some point, we will. We're just not there yet.\"\n\nThe third and final part of the RHONY Season 10 reunion is coming up on Wednesday at 8/7c. How will it all end?
