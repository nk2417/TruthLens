So, did the season 18 runner-up pull out a win his second time around?\n\nThe answer is: no.\n\nThe finale saw Paul sit in the final three with Christmas Abbott and Josh Martinez. And Josh came out victorious in one of the most \u201cvolatile\u201d seasons of the show, as host Julie Chen described it.\n\nIt was a shock to some that the Miami native walked away this season with a lot more than just meatballs, but one thing that wasn\u2019t a shock was how angry the jury felt towards Paul.\n\nIn the jury segment that was full of bitter members it was one of the most entertaining moments of the summer with a face-off between fan-favorite Mark and the one deemed as a piece of furniture by fans, Matt.\n\n\u201cVery poor jury management,\u201d Mark said about Paul. \u201cI\u2019m a bitter juror,\u201d admitted Elena. \u201cI don\u2019t respect how this season played out and I don\u2019t respect his strategies,\u201d said Mark. And when Alex went to cast her vote for who she wanted to win she made it clear that she was voting for who stabbed her in the front rather than the back.\n\nUltimately the final vote came down to both Paul and Josh\u2019s rival Cody, who ultimately voted for Josh to win the game.\n\nAs for the winner of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Favorite Houseguest\u201c? Cody just walked away $25,000 richer.\n\nWhat did you think of the season 19 finale?
