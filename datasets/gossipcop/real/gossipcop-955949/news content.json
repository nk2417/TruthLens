So I've like, been through, I have experienced it enough to have, like, known better.'\n\nKim continued, 'You know, sometimes when you're - you know I was, like, with my sisters and we were laughing and joking and it's loud and you are - you know, I dunno, I guess, sometimes you can get, like, carried away and just, it was insensitive, you know, and it definitely wasn't my intention though.'\n\nThe beauty mogul added, 'And I think, especially my fans and everyone that was watching was supportive, like, \"OK, look, like, maybe you guys shouldn't have said that but I know what you were saying.\"'\n\nGetty Images\n\n30/07/18: New Videos Show Kendall Jenner And Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Praising Kim For Her New 'Anorexic' Look\n\nThe Kardashian and Jenner sisters are a shining example of sibling support. Never breaking ranks and always being the first to defend each other, the daughters of Kris Jenner prove that being sisterly is the best.\n\n\n\nAnd, usually, we applaud them for that.\n\nHowever, one of Kim Kardashian\u2019s recent series of Instagram stories proves that, whilst they may be good at boosting each other\u2019s morale, their comments aren't always 100% spot on.\n\nWhilst attending a poker tournament benefiting City Of Hope, the 37 year-old mother-of-three filmed her sisters praising her gym-honed figure. Unfortunately, many of their compliments appeared to be centred on her thinness, praising her for looking like she doesn\u2019t eat and having an \u2018anorexic\u2019 waist.\n\nIn multiple videos Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Kendall Jenner discuss the beauty mogul\u2019s 119 pound weight.\n\nAt one point supermodel Kendall says, \u2018No, like I\u2019m really concerned, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re eating. Like, you look so skinny\u2019, to which Kim retorts, \u2018What, oh my God thank you!\u2019 and Kendall replies, \u2018Of course.\u2019\n\nIn another video Khlo\u00e9 details Kim\u2019s figure, \u2018But she's anorexic here [points to waist] and her arms are like pin thin, they're like my pinkie\u2014it's bizarre.\u2019\n\nPraising someone for reaching a personal goal, or even for their persistence in the gym is one thing, but isn\u2019t calling them \u2018anorexic\u2019 quite another?\n\nFans have already taken to Twitter to voice their concern.\n\nOne user who describes herself as 'battling an eating disorder' states, \u2018Kim Kardashian\u2019s Instagram story is very triggering yikes.\u2019\n\nOthers say that the videos make them want to throw their phone, \u2018into outer space\u2019, whilst another concludes, 'Stop promoting unhealthy body image and eating habits for young girls'.\n\nWith this coming months after that appetite suppressant advert gaff you'd think Kim would think twice about putting these kind of harmful comments out into the world, but apparently not.\n\nRelated Story Kim Kardashian Defends Wearing Braids\n\nRelated Story Kim Kardashian
