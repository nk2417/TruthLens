{"url": "https://www.self.com/story/gina-rodriguez-february-2018", "text": "Maybe that\u2019s because the film could be a metaphor for her life for the last several years: Flanked by her own support squad, Rodriguez has marched headlong into a forbidding reality of chronic illness and come out stronger and bolder than ever. As she asserts her power in her personal life and her career, battling forces that, like The Shimmer, loom large and seemingly beyond her control, she is fighting not just for herself, but for other women in Hollywood and beyond, forging for them a path forward and up.\n\nRodriguez, 33, has Hashimoto\u2019s disease, an autoimmune condition that wages war on the thyroid gland, which produces hormones that influence how your body uses energy. Hashimoto\u2019s can lead to an underactive thyroid that doesn\u2019t produce enough of these hormones, and symptoms can be devastating and wide-ranging, including fatigue, joint pain, memory issues, and weight gain, to name a few.\n\n\u201cTo the core of my being, I know what it\u2019s like to feel like there is no way I can win this, so where do I even begin?\u201d\n\nAt first, Rodriguez says, Hashimoto\u2019s felt like \u201cthe curse of a lifetime,\u201d especially in an industry that places so much emphasis on size. The disease, though treatable, has no cure. For years after being diagnosed with hypothyroidism at 19 and Hashimoto\u2019s at 26, and putting on weight that wouldn\u2019t budge, Rodriguez preferred to deny what she was going through rather than focus her efforts on doing whatever she could to feel better. \u201cTo the core of my being, I know what it\u2019s like to feel like there is no way I can win this, so where do I even begin,\u201d she reflects.\n\nShe tried to rebel against what she knew her body needed by not taking her medicine on time, eating foods that she knew would make her feel terrible (looking at you, dairy), or deciding working out wasn\u2019t worth it if it wouldn\u2019t change her body. Eventually, she realized something had to give: \u201c[Hashimoto\u2019s] affects so many aspects of your life. I\u2019ve had it for so many years\u2026that rebellion of not taking care of myself can\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/5a7dfbc3a2e4610403db1d84/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Gina_Rodriguez_4.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a7dfbbea2e4610403db1d80/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Gina_Rodriguez_2.jpg", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a7dfbbde1c59b0841326f99/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Gina_Rodriguez_1.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5ed8128f0c60d44a5699bea6/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a85e2bee1c59b0841327607/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/gina-rodriguez-alexander-wang.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a85e2bee1c59b0841327607/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/gina-rodriguez-alexander-wang.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5a7dfbc5a2e4610403db1d86/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Gina_Rodriguez_6.jpg", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self-us/assets/logo-header.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/5a85e2bee1c59b0841327607/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/gina-rodriguez-alexander-wang.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zahra Thompson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/gina-rodriguez-february-2018", "title": "Gina Rodriguez on Hashimoto's, Equal Pay, and Learning to Fight For Herself", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Zahra Thompson", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Actor and director Gina Rodriguez is taking on Hollywood, and dealing with Hashimoto's disease.
