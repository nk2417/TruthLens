One of the stars of the reboot, Nathalie Kelley, who plays Cristal, has confirmed in an E! interview that she will not be returning for Season 2.\n\nThe development is not entirely shocking \u2014 Cristal, Alexis or Michael\u2019s fates were left up in the air in the Season 1 finale cliffhanger, which ended with the three still trapped in a fire after Cristal also had been shot.\n\nStill, Kelley\u2019s exit changes the original setup of the reboot, in which the story of the feud between the Carringtons and the Colbys was to be told primarily through the perspectives of two women at odds: Fallon Carrington (Elizabeth Gillies), daughter of billionaire Blake Carrington (Grant Show), and her soon-to-be stepmother, Cristal (Kelley), a Hispanic woman marrying into this WASP family and America\u2019s most powerful class.\n\nthe CW\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nCristal was a version of the Krystle Jennings character in the original series, played by Linda Evans, which was considered a female lead. It also was the case on the CW\u2019s Dynasty, whose Season 1 key art featured Gillies, Kelley and Show.\n\nThe dynamic on the show already changed with the introduction of Nicollette Sheridan as Alexis Carrington late in Season 1.\n\nThe decision to make the stepmom Hispanic was an effort to bring the 1980s soap to the 21st century and better reflect the diversity of America today as well as add a race/class dimension to the family conflicts, though fan reaction to the character has been somewhat mixed.\n\nAsked about Cristal fate, Kelley, a Peruvian-born Australian actress, said, \u201cIs it a coma? Is it death? \u2026 I actually don\u2019t know. But I know that I\u2019m not going to Atlanta in July, that I\u2019m staying [in LA]\u2026. I\u2019ve got my life back.\u201d", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/keyart-single-dynasty-vertical.jpg", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dynasty1.jpg?w=1024", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dynasty1.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dynasty1.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nellie Andreeva", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/06/dynasty-nathalie-kelley-exits-season-2-the-cw-crystal-1202416159/", "title": "\u2018Dynasty\u2019: Lead Cast Member Not Returning For Season 2 Of the CW Series", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "One of the stars of the Dynasty reboot, Nathalie Kelley, who plays Crystal, has confirmed that she will not be returning for Season 2.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Nellie Andreeva", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Dynasty\u2019: Lead Cast Member Not Returning For Season 2 Of the CW Series", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/06/dynasty-nathalie-kelley-exits-season-2-the-cw-crystal-1202416159/", "description": "One of the stars of the Dynasty reboot, Nathalie Kelley, who plays Crystal, has confirmed  that she will not be returning for Season 2.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dynasty1.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 585, "alt": "'Dynasty': Lead Cast Member Not Returning For Season 2 Of the CW Series"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-23T02:03:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-23T06:29:17+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "One of the stars of the Dynasty reboot, Nathalie Kelley, who plays Crystal, has confirmed  that she will not be returning for Season 2.", "site": "@Deadline", "creator": "@DeadlineNellie", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Dynasty\u2019: Lead Cast Member Not Returning For Season 2 Of the CW Series", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/dynasty1.jpg?w=1024"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529719423.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
