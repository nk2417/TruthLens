But if you are made fun of, just don't let it bother you. Stay strong I guess. It's hard. But it'll probably get better one day.\"\n\nThat day might just be today.\n\nAs of Sunday evening, Keaton's video had more than 18.5 million views and had been shared more than 369,000 times on Facebook. His message resonated with an eclectic mix of celebrities, who responded by condemning bullying, sharing their own experiences and lauding Keaton for his courage.\n\nHorace Maynard Principal Greg Clay told a News Sentinel reporter on Monday that he wasn't aware of Keaton being bullied repeatedly, and said the problem of bullying at the school is \"not as rampant as the video would have you believe.\"\n\nClay said the incident described in the video was resolved weeks ago, and said disciplinary action was taken against the children who bullied Keaton. He said he couldn't give specifics.\n\n\"I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s like this,\" Clay said. \"We all sympathize with Keaton and we\u2019re doing everything we can to make sure it never happens again. Everybody saw the video and it was horrible. We don\u2019t want anyone to feel like that. Keaton\u2019s a good kid. We\u2019ll take care of him.\"\n\nThe USA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee has not been able to reach Kimberly Jones.\n\nThe reaction\n\nJarrett Guarantano, a University of Tennessee Vols quarterback, tweeted a picture with his \"new best bud\" on Sunday evening.\n\n\"So I got the chance to spend the day with my new best bud Keaton,\" Guarantano wrote. \"It was unbelievable to get to know him and realize that we have a lot in common. This dude is very special and has changed my life forever. Now I have the little brother I always wanted! God bless you my man.\"\n\nDana White said he wants to bring Keaton to Las Vegas to hang out at UFC headquarters. In a video posted to the official UFC Twitter account, various fighters spoke about bullying and offered words of support to Keaton.\n\nIn a tweet, the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., called Keaton \"incredibly brave\" and said he \"would be honored\" to host Keaton and his family if they take White up on his offer.\n\nChris Evans invited Keaton and his mom to the premier of the new \"Avengers\" movie in Los Angeles next year.\n\nSean Hannity said he wants to fly Keaton and his parents to New York City to visit Fox News.\n\n\"Walking Dead\" actor Tom Payne invited Keaton to a \"Walker Stalker Con\" show in Nashville.\n\nThe outpouring of support went on and on.\n\nJustin Bieber (@justinbieber) * Instagram photos and videos\n\nReporter Rachel Ohm contributed to this story.\n\nReporter Travis Dorman can be reached at 865-342-6315 or at travis.dorman@knoxnews.com.
