You can see the device they put in my heart 2 years ago\u2026 on my X-ray that I got today! God is so good!!\u201d Zolciak-Biermann wrote in the caption of the photo, which she labelled \u201cMy chest X-ray and you can see the device in my heart! Crazy!!\u201d\n\nZolciak-Biermann had a stroke caused by a blood clot on Sept. 23, 2015, after flying from Los Angeles back home to Atlanta from Dancing with the Stars filming.\n\n\u201cI bent down to hug my son KJ and all of a sudden my left hand went numb,\u201d Zolciak-Biermann told PEOPLE in November of that year. \u201cIt was like a million ants were crawling over my body.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE? Sign up for our daily newsletter to get our best stories of the day delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSoon, she was unable to feel her face or tongue. \u201cI\u2019m always joking around with my kids,\u201d the mother of six told PEOPLE. \u201cI do these Jim Carrey impersonations with my face and my daughter Brielle thought I was doing that! She said, \u2018Mom, cut it out, you\u2019re not funny.\u2019 \u201d\n\nUsing all her strength to grab her daughter\u2019s arm, the reality star made it clear she wasn\u2019t kidding around. Zolciak-Biermann didn\u2019t know it at the time, but she was having a stroke.\n\nCharles Sykes/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty\n\nAfter recovering, Zolciak-Biermann underwent surgery to close a hole that doctors found in her heart.\n\n\u201cThe stroke was life changing \u2014 literally,\u201dshe said during an August 2017 appearance of Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry. \u201cI never thought at 37 I would have a stroke, and in front of my children nonetheless. I\u2019ve pretty much fully recovered, but I can\u2019t say that I don\u2019t think, \u2018Could this happen again?\u2019 \u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Zolciak-Biermann Says She Received Death Threats After RHOA Costar NeNe Leakes Called Her \u2018Racist\u2019\n\nSince then, Zolciak-Biermann has become an outspoken advocate on the issue.\n\nIn July of last year, she shared stroke identification tips on her Instagram to help others recognize it happening \u2014 sharing that despite lingering symptoms of the stroke, such as the occasional slip of her tongue or forgetting of a word, she is \u201calmost fully recovered\u201d and is feeling \u201cgreat.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had my stroke at 37!! It can happen to anyone at any age!!\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhen in doubt please always check it out!!\u201d", "images":
