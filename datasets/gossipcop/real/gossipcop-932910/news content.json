E! released a short clip of the moment on Thursday, ahead of an episode airing this Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIs everyone writing you?\u201d her sister, Kourtney Kardashian, asked Khloe while standing next to her hospital bed.\n\n\u201cToo many people, but writing about both things [the cheating and her giving birth],\u201d Khloe responded quietly. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018Shut up.\u2019 I don\u2019t have the energy for that right now. Like, everyone, leave me alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like everyone just wants you to feel that you\u2019re supported,\u201d Kourtney said, as Kim looked on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI appreciate that, I do,\u201d Khloe answered. \u201cIt\u2019s also, everyone has their own shit that I know nothing about and mine is thrown on the public of everything.\u201d\n\nKhloe Kardashian pictured after giving birth to her daughter, True, in April. E! News/\"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a lot harder to filter through stuff when it\u2019s this public and when I gave birth the following day. It\u2019s just too much,\u201d she added, putting her hand over her chest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a previous episode of the reality TV show, Khloe explained why why she wanted Thompson in the delivery room with her, despite everything that he\u2019d done.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like, everyone wants me to make a decision right this second and I just want to go and give birth and focus on that and try to enjoy this and try to enjoy it with him, as crazy as that sounds,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 said at the time.\n\n\u201cI want to enjoy this with him. I don\u2019t want any negativity in the delivery room. I don\u2019t want anybody to talk about it, make me feel uncomfortable or make him feel uncomfortable. Let\u2019s just act normal. Give me a minute.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to a tweet she posted earlier this month when the traumatic episode aired, the 34-year-old is still happy with her game-time decision.\n\nI wanted to have a beautiful birthing experience for myself and for the memories of what I choose to share with True when she\u2019s older. I want her to have videos and pictures of her daddy there, holding her etc. I want her to know she is LOVE and my happiness! Babies feel energy! \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) November 5, 2018\n\nI know this! I chose to put my feelings aside for the birth and to try and have as much positive energy that I could. My only thought was about the birth of my daughter. I wasn\u2019t going to let ANYONE disrupt anything less than what she deserved. Joyous love. I chose to be mature & \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) November 5, 2018\n\nAdvertisement\n\nstrong for True. I waited for this day for so many years! I know now, looking back that I was in shock because I couldn\u2019t believe that this would ever happen to me but I\u2019m still very proud of myself for how I handled everything. True gave me the peace and strength I needed \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) November 5, 2018", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/631d16ff2200001900ca9324.png?ops=100_100", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad2fb73c000020010b1930.jpeg?cache=3OG96SSz8d&ops=1200_630", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bedf408240000490299b8c8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad2fb73c000020010b1930.jpeg?cache=3OG96SSz8d&ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/khloe-kardashian-cheating-scandal-birth_n_5bede529e4b0860184a6a3b1", "title": "Watch Khloe Kardashian Sound Off On Tristan Thompson Cheating Scandal After Giving Birth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "\"It\u2019s just too much,\u201d the overwhelmed reality star said.", "keywords": "The Kardashians,khloe kardashian", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "og": {"title": "Cameras Captured Khloe K Grappling With Tristan's Cheating After Giving Birth", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad2fb73c000020010b1930.jpeg?cache=3OG96SSz8d&ops=1200_630", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad2fb73c000020010b1930.jpeg?cache=3OG96SSz8d&ops=1200_630", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/khloe-kardashian-cheating-scandal-birth_n_5bede529e4b0860184a6a3b1", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "\"It\u2019s just too much,\u201d the overwhelmed reality star said."}, "article": {"tag": "The Kardashians,khloe kardashian", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-11-15T23:28:48Z", "modified_time": "2018-11-15T23:28:48Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HuffPostEnt", "title": "Cameras Captured Khloe K Grappling With Tristan's Cheating After Giving Birth", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad2fb73c000020010b1930.jpeg?cache=3OG96SSz8d&ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "description": "\"It\u2019s just too much,\u201d the overwhelmed reality star said."}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5bede529e4b0860184a6a3b1", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "bingbot": "noarchive", "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/psj8Eit6bQ4?rel=0&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=1"], "publish_date": 1542324528.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
