People think you\u2019re beautiful, you\u2019re thin, you\u2019re rich, you\u2019re photographed on the red carpet, and you get stuck in this category.'\n\nShe added: 'There\u2019s so much more depth beyond all that with Georgina.'\n\nCasa Chapman: Abedin and Hillary Clinton leave the house Weinstein and Chapman once shared following a fundraisers in 2016\n\nAbedin also noted that while Chapman may look flawless most of the time, she is more concerned with her kids and making a happy home than keeping up her appearance - or apperances.\n\n'You look at her from the outside, if you don\u2019t know her, and you think, \"She\u2019s perfect. She could be a model for the clothes she designs,\"' says Abedin.\n\n'But when you go to the house, she opens the door without any makeup on, and she\u2019s stunning, and she\u2019s funny and goofy with her children\u2014who are clearly the most important people in her life.'\n\nAbedin continued: 'She\u2019s at the stove making chicken fingers and French fries, and she\u2019s one of the realest people I know. There\u2019s nothing entitled about her. You believe she is someone who works really hard at being a good and present mom, and doing her job really well.'\n\nThe two women are now both single mothers with full-time jobs, although Chapman is thinking about getting out of the spotlight and moving to a farm upstate.\n\nAbedin seems intent on staying in New York City however, where on Monday night she attended the annual Met Gala.\n\nChapman did not attend as she is still laying low, but she was still the talk of the town later in the evening after Scarlett Johansson became the first star to wear a Marchesa gown since the Weinstein scandal.\n\nThe end: Abedin also praised Chapman as an incredible mother while revealing their sons brought them together as well, with their frequent play dates (Abedin in court with estranged husband Anthony Weiner in September)\n\nNo empathy: 'People don\u2019t feel sorry for us; you don\u2019t get empathy. People think you\u2019re beautiful, you\u2019re thin, you\u2019re rich, you\u2019re photographed ,' said Abedin (left and Chapman right at a party for Anna Wintour they both attended in June 2017)\n\nChapman's beauty was also one of the first things that struck Oscar-nominated actor David Oyelowo after the two ran into one another while auditioning for a theater program.\n\n'Well, anyone who has seen Georgina, the first thing that hits you like a ton of bricks is how beautiful she is, and I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t notice that,' said Oyelowo, who shot to fame following the critical praise he received for his work in Selma.\n\n'But as we talked, I found her to be an interesting and deeply friendly person. She had none of that frostiness that could be associated with a model.'\n\nThe two kept in touch as Oyelowo pursued acting and Chapman art, and the designer eventually invited the actor to one of her art exhibits.\n\n'A lot of the drawings were of fashion, and her work really stood out,' he said.\n\n'I was blown away.'\n\nHe then asked Chapman to design the costumes for his next play.\n\n'And these costumes arrived, made from transparent material into which she\u2019d sewn pieces of mirror to reflect the light. They were extraordinary,' he recalled of Chapman's pieces.\n\n'They upstaged everything else.'\n\nFashion industry icon Karen Elson also spoke to the magazine, and revealed she is quick to defend her friend should people get the wrong idea of Chapman's involvement or responsibility for her husband's actions.\n\n'\"She must have known\" is what so many people say at dinner parties,' said Elson.\n\n'The thing that pains me is that when anyone finds out that I know George, that\u2019s the first thing they say. Like she is somehow responsible for his hideous behavior.'\n\nElson then revealed things do not get much better when she reveals that her friend did not know about Weinstein's alleged behavior.\n\n'When I say, \"Well, actually she didn\u2019t know,\" it becomes this other judgment: \"How could she not have known?\" Or: \"Well, that\u2019s on her if she didn\u2019t.\" It\u2019s so complicated.'\n\nDisbelief: '\"She must have known\" is what so many people say at dinner parties,' said model Karen Elson (l to r: Rita Ora, Naomi Campbell, Oprah Winfrey, Chapman and Elson in 2014). 'The thing that pains me is that when anyone finds out that I know George, that\u2019s the first thing they say. Like she is somehow responsible for his hideous behavior'\n\nLooker: Chapman's beauty was also one of the first things that struck Oscar-nominated actor David Oyelowo after the two ran into one another while auditioning for a theater program (pair above in 2015)\n\nThe designer said that she is still feeling a wide range of emotions after all these months.\n\n'There was a part of me that was terribly naive - clearly, so naive,' said Chapman.\n\n'I have moments of rage, I have moments of confusion, I have moments of disbelief!'\n\nChapman said that most of all, she worries her two children - India, 7, and Dashiell - and the effect the scandal will have on them.\n\n'I have moments when I just cry for my children. What are their lives going to be? What are people going to say to them?' she said in tears.\n\n'It's like, they love their dad. They love him. I just can't bear it for them!'\n\nThe scarlet barretter: Johannson became the first women to wear Marchesa since the scandal when she donned a gown by Chapman and Keren Craig to the Met Gala\n\nWhen asked if she was ever suspicious about Weinstein's behavior, Chapman said: 'Absolutely not. Never'. She added that he frequently traveled for work and she had never obsessed about where he was.\n\n'That's what makes this so incredibly painful: I had what I thought was a very happy marriage. I loved my life.'\n\nChapman also revealed that she had not offered up any of her dresses to celebrities for the past awards season, putting to rest rumors that women were boycotting the line she co-founded with good friend Keren Craig.\n\n'We didn't feel it was appropriate given the situation. All the women who have been hurt deserve dignity and respect, so I want to give it the time it deserves. It's a time for mourning, really,' she said.\n\n'A lot of people reached out and said, 'Let me wear something',' she added about her loyal followers. Scarlett Johansson wore a Marchesa gown to this year's Met gala.\n\nChapman added that she had shut herself off from the world in the five months after the scandal first broke and hadn't been out in public since.\n\n'I was so humiliated and so broken... that... I, I, I... didn't think it was respectful to go out,' she said.\n\n'I thought, Who am I to be parading around with all of this going on? It's still so very, very raw. I was walking up the stairs the other day and I stopped; it was like all the air had been punched out of my lungs.'\n\nWhen the allegations against Weinstein first became public in a series of exposes in the New York Times and The New Yorker, Chapman said it took about two days for the scandal to sink in.\n\n'I lost ten pounds in five days. I couldn't keep food down,' she said.\n\n'My head was spinning. And it was difficult because the first article was about a time long before I'd ever met him, so there was a minute where I couldn't make an informed decision. And then the stories expanded and I realized that this wasn't an isolated incident. And I knew that I needed to step away and take the kids out of here.'\n\nShe fled to Los Angeles and eventually back to London where her parents live.", "images":
