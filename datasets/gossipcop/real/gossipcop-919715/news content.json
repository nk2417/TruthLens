And that type of sinister, shadow energy cannot be concealed.\u201d\n\nAsked if she sensed a darkness, Bonet said, \u201cAlways. And if I had anything more to reveal, then it would have happened a long time ago. That\u2019s my nature. The truth will set you free.\u201d\n\nCosby is in pre-trial hearings in Pennsylvania for his sexual assault retrial. The 80-year-old comedian has been accused by multiple women of sexually assaulting them after drugging them. His first trial on those charges ended in a hung jury, and the retrial is expected to start in April.\n\nBonet had a somewhat rocky relationship with Cosby. She was frequently late on the set and posed topless for Interview magazine, a step away from the wholesome family image that the TV shows tried to cultivate. Cosby also opposed her role in the film Angel Heart, in which she had a nude scene with Mickey Rourke, and allegedly opposed her marriage at age 20 to rocker Lenny Kravitz.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nDespite that, Bonet is not vindictive. \u201cI don\u2019t need to say, \u2018I told you so\u2019,\u201d she said regarding Cosby. \u201cI just leave all that to karma and justice and what will be.\u201d", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lisabonet.jpg?w=512&h=383&crop=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lisabonet.jpg?w=512", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lisabonet.jpg?w=512", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bruce Haring", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/03/lisa-bonet-speaks-out-about-her-tv-father-bill-cosby-claims-sinister-shadow-energy-1202332025/", "title": "Lisa Bonet Speaks Out About Her TV Father, Bill Cosby \u2013 Claims \u201cSinister, Shadow Energy\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Lisa Bonet Speaks Out About Her TV Father, Bill Cosby - Claims \"Sinister, Shadow Energy\"", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Bruce Haring", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Lisa Bonet Speaks Out About Her TV Father, Bill Cosby \u2013 Claims \u201cSinister, Shadow Energy\u201d", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/03/lisa-bonet-speaks-out-about-her-tv-father-bill-cosby-claims-sinister-shadow-energy-1202332025/", "description": "Lisa Bonet Speaks Out About Her TV Father, Bill Cosby - Claims \"Sinister, Shadow Energy\"", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lisabonet.jpg?w=512", "width": 512, "height": 391, "alt": "Lisa Bonet Speaks Out About Her TV Father, Bill Cosby - Claims \"Sinister, Shadow Energy\""}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-10T23:59:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-11T19:08:10+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lisa Bonet Speaks Out About Her TV Father, Bill Cosby - Claims \"Sinister, Shadow Energy\"", "site": "@Deadline", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lisa Bonet Speaks Out About Her TV Father, Bill Cosby \u2013 Claims \u201cSinister, Shadow Energy\u201d", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lisabonet.jpg?w=512"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520726358.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
