Although the moment was undeniably awesome, it\u2019s a little unclear when Sansa, Arya, and their brother/human computer Bran all got together to sort things out and end up on the same side. In an interview with Variety Isaac Hempstead Wright, who plays Bran, explained that they filmed that scene and it didn\u2019t make the final episode.\n\n\u201cWe actually did a scene that clearly got cut, a short scene with Sansa where she knocks on Bran\u2019s door and says, \u2018I need your help,\u2019 or something along those lines,\u201d Hempstead Wright explained. \u201cSo basically, as far as I know, the story was that it suddenly occurred to Sansa that she had a huge CCTV department at her discretion and it might be a good idea to check with him first before she guts her own sister. So she goes to Bran, and Bran tells her everything she needs to know, and she\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, s\u2014.\u2019\u201d\n\nHempstead Wright\u2019s comments seem to confirm that Arya and Sansa weren\u2019t secretly pretending to go along with Littlefinger\u2019s ruse the whole time, as some suspected. Seeing Sansa and Bran actually work this out would\u2019ve made for a nice scene that could\u2019ve helped made the Winterfell plot feel a little more organic, but it also would have made their turn on Littlefinger less shocking.\n\nlol rekt. HBO\n\nIt\u2019s kind of Season 7 in a nutshell. The story moved fast enough that the showrunners had to leave out so much connective tissue and included some overly convenient plot points, which made the season as a whole feel less cohesive than earlier seasons. That style of storytelling, though, allowed for some great, great moments.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/inverse/74/e8/57/c3/f29c/424f/88a6/b4187764ba27/aryasansagots7e615033263380jpg.jpeg?w=370&h=278&fit=crop&crop=faces&dpr=2&blend=151515&blendAlpha=40&blendMode=normal", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.comp?c1=2&c2=17519299&v=3.9.1&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/inverse/74/e8/57/c3/f29c/424f/88a6/b4187764ba27/aryasansagots7e615033263380jpg.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/inverse/74/e8/57/c3/f29c/424f/88a6/b4187764ba27/aryasansagots7e615033263380jpg.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inverse.com/article/36032-game-of-thrones-finale-deleted-scene-sansa-arya-littlefinger-bran-twist", "title": "Deleted \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Finale Scene Would\u2019ve Explained a Big Twist", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.inverse.com/article/36032-game-of-thrones-finale-deleted-scene-sansa-arya-littlefinger-bran-twist", "title": "Deleted \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Finale Scene Would\u2019ve Explained a Big Twist", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/inverse/74/e8/57/c3/f29c/424f/88a6/b4187764ba27/aryasansagots7e615033263380jpg.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "site_name": "Inverse"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jgrebes", "site": "@inversedotcom"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-31T14:35:00.000Z", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/inverse"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504190100.0, "source": "https://www.inverse.com", "summary": ""}
