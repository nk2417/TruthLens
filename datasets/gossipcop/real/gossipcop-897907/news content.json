On the cover, Swift is shown in an embellished red dress by YSL that screams fashion-over-function, swapping her classic red lip for a deep purple tone.\n\nExplore Taylor Swift See latest videos, charts and news\n\nSwift thanked the editor \u2014 who referred to her as \u201cindomitable\u201d upon revealing the cover \u2014 as well as both photographers, in an Instagram post early Monday (Dec. 4). \u201cThank you @edward_enninful and @mertalas for your passion, spirit, and contagious laughter on set,\u201d Swift noted. \u201cMert and Marcus took these photos for @britishvogue and my album photos for reputation, and it\u2019s been such a bonding experience working together so closely and talking so much about what we wanted to make. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done a magazine cover. I\u2019m really happy my first one back was with such wonderful people. #newvogue.\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/03-Taylor-Swift-press-photo-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/03-Taylor-Swift-press-photo-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=628&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/03-Taylor-Swift-press-photo-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Allison Stubblebine", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/taylor-swift-vogue-uk-jan-2018-cover-8055047/", "title": "British \u2018Vogue\u2019 Reveals Taylor Swift as January 2018 Cover Star", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Taylor is set to grace the cover of Edward Enninful's second cover for British Vogue.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Allison Stubblebine", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "British \u2018Vogue\u2019 Reveals Taylor Swift as January 2018 Cover Star", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/taylor-swift-vogue-uk-jan-2018-cover-8055047/", "description": "Taylor is set to grace the cover of Edward Enninful's second cover for British Vogue.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/03-Taylor-Swift-press-photo-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Taylor Swift"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-04T18:16:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-05T16:36:06+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Taylor is set to grace the cover of Edward Enninful's second cover for British Vogue.", "site": "@billboard", "creator": "@MsAllyMackenzie", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "British \u2018Vogue\u2019 Reveals Taylor Swift as January 2018 Cover Star", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/03-Taylor-Swift-press-photo-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512411385.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
