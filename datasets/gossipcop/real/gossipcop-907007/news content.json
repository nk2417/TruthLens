And we're told 2 other men came forward in February with allegations of sexual assault -- one claiming an incident occurred in Gloucester in 2013 and the other in Lambeth in 2008.\n\nAs we reported ... Spacey became the subject of a Scotland Yard investigation in January when an alleged victim went to police claiming he was sexually assaulted in Westminster in 2005. Cops in London were already investigating 2 similar complaints before that.\n\nWe're told, just like the Scotland Yard cases, officers from the Child Abuse and Sexual Offences Command are involved in the 3 news cases.\n\nThere's also an active criminal investigation in Massachusetts involving a then 18-year-old male. And the L.A. County D.A. is reviewing other allegations.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/7f/o/2018/07/03/7f594f58c2c35c45bdb4eab42f48e741_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/f6/16by9/2018/07/03/f6fa07c73516508ca95e42c07c1cec72_xl.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/27/16by9/2018/04/11/271c009c6a905ef1a0130d55516f6ca2_xs.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/thirtymilezone.svg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e3/16by9/2025/11/20/e3028a12684b463faee721ff211e9954_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/0f/16by9/2025/11/20/0fe06478a3e241edaa03423e7f006606_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/de/4by3/2025/11/19/def9d7aac6b04006a89c0cf3fb46eb21_xxs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/b4/16by9/2025/11/20/b4fbe4e8e5654748a5497e1a52b939b1_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/43/16by9/2018/07/03/43346d44c56d5e5f856ee8fd89d0c0a3_xs.jpeg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e4/16by9/2025/11/20/e4ccda421f7140fb91551c634a62d9dc_xs.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/article/google-preferred-source.png", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/72/16by9/2025/11/20/726f88d680674fccaa77ad055cd10d2e_xs.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/f6/16by9/2018/07/03/f6fa07c73516508ca95e42c07c1cec72_xl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2018/07/03/kevin-spacey-new-london-sexual-assaults-investigation/", "title": "Kevin Spacey Investigated for 3 New Sexual Assaults in London", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=0.25,maximum-scale=10", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "google-site-verification": "UUmtbUBf3djgPpCeLefe_PbFsOc6JGxfXmHzpjFLAEQ", "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "p": {"domain_verify": "933e74ace98032aadbc3328616280038"}, "robots": "index,follow,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kevin Spacey is now being investigated for 6 sexual assaults in London.", "fb": {"app_id": 310610065699820}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tmz"}, "og": {"site_name": "TMZ", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.tmz.com/2018/07/03/kevin-spacey-new-london-sexual-assaults-investigation/", "title": "Kevin Spacey Investigated for 3 New Sexual Assaults in London", "description": "Kevin Spacey is now being investigated for 6 sexual assaults in London.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/f6/16by9/2018/07/03/f6fa07c73516508ca95e42c07c1cec72_xl.jpg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TMZ", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kevin Spacey Investigated for 3 New Sexual Assaults in London", "description": "Kevin Spacey is now being investigated for 6 sexual assaults in London.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/f6/16by9/2018/07/03/f6fa07c73516508ca95e42c07c1cec72_xl.jpg"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=299948601, app-argument=https://www.tmz.com/2018/07/03/kevin-spacey-new-london-sexual-assaults-investigation/?tmz#article", "application-name": "TMZ.COM", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TMZ.COM", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/msapplication-tile-image-270x270-v1.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.tmz.com/?adid=IE9pin", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#000000", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-tooltip": "TMZ | Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Photos;action-uri=https://www.tmz.com/photos/;icon-uri=https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/favicon-32x32-v1.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530590400.0, "source": "https://www.tmz.com", "summary": ""}
