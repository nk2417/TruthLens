Set in the 1970s, the series explores the early days of criminal psychology and profiling. Two FBI agents, played by Groff and McCallany, interview imprisoned serial killers in an attempt to apply what they learn to current cases.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim when it debuted in October, currently holding a 96 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Sonia Saraiya wrote in her review for Variety: \u201cThere is a subtle, buried thread of \u2018Mindhunter\u2019 that is curious about our collective fascination with these murderers, and when that surfaces, the show approaches brilliance. Even the opening chords of the Talking Heads\u2019 \u2018Psycho Killer\u2019 can\u2019t disturb the mood.\u201d\n\nJoe Penhall created the series. David Fincher, Joshua Donen, Charlize Theron, and Cean Chaffin serve as executive producers.\n\nPopular on Variety", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mindhunter1.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mindhunter1.jpg?w=1000&h=667&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mindhunter1.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Otterson", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/mindhunter-renewed-season-2-netflix-1202626998/", "title": "\u2018Mindhunter\u2019 Renewed for Season 2 at Netflix", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"Mindhunter\" has been renewed for Season 2 at Netflix.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Joe Otterson", "tags": "mindhunter, Netflix", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Mindhunter\u2019 Renewed for Season 2 at Netflix", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/mindhunter-renewed-season-2-netflix-1202626998/", "description": "\"Mindhunter\" has been renewed for Season 2 at Netflix.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mindhunter1.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "'Mindhunter' Renewed for Season 2 at Netflix"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-30T16:19:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-30T16:31:45+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Mindhunter\" has been renewed for Season 2 at Netflix.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@joeotterson", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Mindhunter\u2019 Renewed for Season 2 at Netflix", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/mindhunter1.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512058774.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
