However, she and Packer called off their engagement two months before the series launched. (Shortly after the series launched, Carey also had a well publicized lip sync mishap on ABC\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2018 Eve.)\n\nThe eight-episode first season launched in December to 2.2 million viewers. However, viewership consistently dipped and the season finale drew just 510,000 viewers.\n\nMariah\u2019s World hailed from longtime E! collaborate Bunim/Murray Productions, which also produces the network\u2019s long-running hit Keeping Up With the Kardashians and its many spinoffs.\n\nMariah\u2019s World also marked Carey\u2019s first major TV commitment since she served as a judge on American Idol in season 12, which she called an \u201cabusive\u201d experience while promoting Mariah\u2019s World.\n\nIn addition to the Kardashians\u2018 empire, E!\u2019s unscripted slate includes the WAGS franchise, Botched, Hollywood Medium, Famously Single, Eric and Jesse, Total Bellas and Total Divas, Second Wives Club and What Happens at the Abbey.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-645978852_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-645978852_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Stanhope", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/mariahs-world-not-returning-season-2-1040616/", "title": "Mariah Carey\u2019s E!
