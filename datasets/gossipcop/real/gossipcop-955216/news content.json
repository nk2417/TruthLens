Josh O\u2019Connor (God\u2019s Own Country) and Marion Bailey (Allied) have joined the cast of the Left Bank Pictures-produced drama for season three.\n\nO\u2019Connor, who also starred in Florence Foster Jenkins, replaces Julian Baring, while Bailey replaces Victoria Hamilton.\n\nIt comes as production on season three is in full swing ahead of a 2019 launch.\n\nO\u2019Connor, said, \u201cI am thrilled to be joining The Firm for the next instalment of The Crown. Seasons 3 and 4 will follow some of the most turbulent events in the Prince of Wales\u2019s life and our national story and I\u2019m excited to be bringing to life the man in the midst of it all. I\u2019m very aware it\u2019s a formidably talented family to be joining, but reliably informed I have the ears for the part and will fit right in.\u201d\n\nBailey added, \u201cWonderful to be joining The Crown. It\u2019s a brilliant show and we have a tough act to follow but what a gift to be playing the fascinating and greatly loved Queen Mother. Thrilled to be on board and working with such a top-notch team.\u201d", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pjimage2.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pjimage2.jpg?w=1000"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pjimage2.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Peter White", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/07/the-crown-finds-its-prince-charles-queen-mother-for-season-three-1202434058/", "title": "\u2018The Crown\u2019 Finds Its Prince Charles & Queen Mother For Season Three", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Josh O'Connor\u00a0(God\u2019s Own Country) and Marion Bailey\u00a0(Allied) have joined the cast of The Crown.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Peter White", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018The Crown\u2019 Finds Its Prince Charles & Queen Mother For Season Three", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/07/the-crown-finds-its-prince-charles-queen-mother-for-season-three-1202434058/", "description": "Josh O'Connor\u00a0(God\u2019s Own Country) and Marion Bailey\u00a0(Allied) have joined the cast of The Crown.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pjimage2.jpg?w=1000", "width": 1000, "height": 1000, "alt": "'The Crown' Finds Its Prince Charles & Queen Mother For Season Three"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-26T15:40:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-26T15:41:50+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Josh O'Connor\u00a0(God\u2019s Own Country) and Marion Bailey\u00a0(Allied) have joined the cast of The Crown.", "site": "@Deadline", "creator": "@peterzwhite", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018The Crown\u2019 Finds Its Prince Charles & Queen Mother For Season Three", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/pjimage2.jpg?w=1000"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532619627.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
