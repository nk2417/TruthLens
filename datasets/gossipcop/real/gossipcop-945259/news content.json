She\u2019s handled Trooping the Colour, as well as her first \u201coff-site\u201d day trip with the Queen, and on Tuesday, Meghan arrived at her first Royal Ascot, the formal carriage procession that marks the beginning of a five-day racing extravaganza in Berkshire.\n\nMeghan arrived for the festivities in a carriage along with Prince Harry (donning a top hat), Prince Edward, and Countess Sophie, with Meghan spotted \u201csharing a joke\u201d with Sophie as they made their way onto the premises. (It\u2019s always amusing how even the slightest whispered aside at these events, when everyone is watching, become used as proof of a great convivial bond.)\n\nMeghan again wore a Givenchy look, after working with the designer for both her wedding and her dress for her day with the Queen. And, as she has for nearly all her major events since becoming a royal, Meghan decided to wear a dress in the white-cream-beige family, as she chose a white collared dress, accessorized with a white and black Philip Treacy hat. (A royal correspondent for The Sun deemed the look \u201cAudrey Hepburn-esque.\u201d)\n\nThe Queen\u2014in bright yellow\u2014rode into the Ascot with Princess Anne, both no doubt in good spirits following the birth of Zara Phillips\u2019s second daughter yesterday, another great-grandchild for the Queen and granddaughter for Princess Anne.\n\nPrince William and the Duchess of Cambridge sat this one out, as Kate eases back into appearances following the birth of their third child, Louis.", "images":
