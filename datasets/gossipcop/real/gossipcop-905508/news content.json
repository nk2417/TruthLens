Sources previously told PEOPLE that her decision to break up was due to their differing stances on marriage and having kids.\n\nThe nuptials would\u2019ve occurred over a year after Cena, 40, proposed to Bella on live TV during WrestleMania 33 in April 2017. And there was even a TV special planned about their wedding set to air in July, but the concept was scrapped after they split after six years together.\n\nWhile Cena and Bella will not be going ahead with their \u201cI dos,\u201d here are all the wedding details they had shared with their fans and viewers of Total Bella and Total Divas.\n\nKevin Mazur/Fox/Getty\n\nThe Dress\n\nThe same month she accepted Cena\u2019s proposal, Bella was already in full wedding mode as she spoke candidly about what she envisioned for her big day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m kind of happy I\u2019m getting married in my 30s, because in my 20s I would\u2019ve had something obnoxious, princess-like Kate Middleton. I want lace I think. I want something very classy, like classic and sexy. Something classic, form-fitting. I do want a veil,\u201d Bella told PEOPLE in April 2017, jokingly adding, \u201cWho am I without cleavage?\u201d\n\nAlso in April 2017, Bella took a trip to New York Bridal Fashion Week to look at wedding dresses from Romona Keveza and Marchesa. In August 2017, Bella revealed hints about her gown, telling PEOPLE Now, \u201cI can say that it\u2019s a Marchesa.\u201d\n\nDuring an episode of Total Divas that aired in January 2018, Brie Bella surprised her twin sister with a bridal shopping trip, during which Nikki tried on multiple dress options.\n\nE! (2)\n\nMeanwhile, Cena did not opt for a custom look.\n\n\u201cI also have a few decent-looking tuxes in the wardrobe already, so depending on the colors and the schemes of the wedding and the theme, I might already have something,\u201d he told PEOPLE in July 2017. \u201cI have a few tailors that I work with, just because I\u2019m not exactly somebody who can buy a suit off the rack.\u201d\n\nWedding Planning\n\nFollowing the engagement, Bella and Cena expressed their excitement for their wedding.\n\n\u201cI think everyone\u2019s going to think I\u2019m a bridezilla. I really do. I think I\u2019m just so happy to be engaged and that John decided he wanted to get married. I just want to take this in and make it fun and happy,\u201d Bella told PEOPLE in April 2017. \u201cThe minute it\u2019s not fun, it\u2019s like why are we doing this? This is why he didn\u2019t want to do it, right? So I want to make it easy and romantic and intimate. Make it for us, no one else but us.\u201d\n\nIn July 2017, Bella announced that Brie would be matron of honor.\n\nEthan Miller/Getty\n\nMeanwhile, Cena told PEOPLE he doesn\u2019t need all the pomp and circumstance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve stressed to Nicole that I would really like to get it done because I guess it took me so long to ask, now that I\u2019ve made the commitment I really just want to get married,\u201d he said in July 2017.\n\n\u201cI want it yesterday, but we have a date,\u201d Cena said in April, shortly before their breakup. \u201cI\u2019m excited, but I also have great perspective that I want the day to be important for Nicole.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAll that information rests on her shoulders. I\u2019m involved in every single step of the process, but I am like the last checkpoint. So, let\u2019s say, d\u00e9cor will be chosen. And then I\u2019ll be given three options but be nudged to like number two. I will politely agree to number two, but I am very much actively a part of the process.\u201d\n\nIn October 2017, Bella, who was competing on Dancing with the Stars at the time, revealed that the wedding date was pushed back. \u201cWe changed the date and location,\u201d she said, adding that the adjustment was spurred by \u201cschedules\u201d as well as their many responsibilities and commitments.\n\nBachelorette Party \u2014 But No Bachelor Party\n\nIn March, Nikki celebrated with a nine-day bachelorette party in Paris with Brie and their closest friends.\n\nMeanwhile, Cena said he had no interest in a stag night.\n\n\u201cNo, I mean, why? Help me out. What is a bachelor party? I\u2019m gonna skip it,\u201d he told E! News in March.\n\nThe Big Day\n\nWhile John and Nikki will not be tying the knot, Brie recently told PEOPLE that she will be there for her sister on their wedding date.\n\nBrie said that she was considering planning a girls trip for her twin to keep their minds distracted. \u201cI\u2019m throwing some stuff out there to her. We might do something, we are deciding. There\u2019s a part of her that just wants to be home,\u201d she said in late April.\n\nJenelle Bonifield\n\n\u201cI just told her, you lead the way and I\u2019ll follow. \u2026 If it\u2019s at home and eating pizza and devouring ice cream, I\u2019m down for that or if want to escape to Napa and down a lot of wine, I\u2019m down for that as well,\u201d Brie added.\n\nThe mother of one also added that Total Bellas viewers will see everything that led up to the former couple\u2019s separation.\n\n\u201cI have to give a lot of credit to John and Nicole. They really opened up their lives and they really wanted to close the curtain and be like this is it, we\u2019re done,\u201d she said. \u201cMy sister is really great with her fans in a way where she lets them connect with her. She lets them like go, \u2018My life isn\u2019t perfect and isn\u2019t easy\u2019 and lets them see the playbook of her life.\u201d", "images":
