A group of completely unknown teenagers cycled onto our Netflix accounts in one of the best TV shows of the year. Within weeks, they were no longer kids, but world-famous actors, and we were talking about The Upside Down and asking, \u201cWhere\u2019s Barb?\u201d Within months, those kids were award-winning too.The well deserved winners of the GQ Editor\u2019s Special Award are the boys of Stranger Things, Caleb McLaughlin, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo and Noah Schnapp!\n\nCreative Maverick of the Year: Sergei Polunin\n\nPresented by Erin O'Connor\n\nDoug Inglish\n\nThis winner has never done things by the book. One of the most gifted ballerinas of his generation, he quit the Royal Ballet just two years after becoming the youngest principal dancer in its history, going on not only to star in a David LaChapelle video set to Hozier\u2019s \u201cTake Me To The Church\u201d, which has been viewed more than 20 million times, but parlayed that into a film career that will see him star in Kenneth Brannagh\u2019s Murder On The Orient Express later this year. He\u2019s known as the \u201cbad boy of ballet\u201d, but he looks pretty good to us.\n\nSpecial Achievement of the Year: Antonio Conte\n\nPresented by Gordon Ramsey", "images":
