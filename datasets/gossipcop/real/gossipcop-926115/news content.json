The two then left town with Nyssa al Ghul to find and destroy some Lazarus Pits. With Haynes now returning solo, should we start worrying about Thea's fate?\n\nSince wrapping his original Arrow run toward the end of Season 3, Haynes' TV credits have included Scream Queens, The Grinder, a Teen Wolf encore and American Horror Story: Cult.\n\nWant more scoop on Arrow, or for any other show?
