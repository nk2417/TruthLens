I am clear and my friend Jomar is clear and my mother is clear. They are the only ones to whom I have to clarify anything. As for Juliana Dominguez from Mississippi, I have nothing I need to clarify to her. Never. About anything.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cThere are people who say that artists have to put up with it.

Nowadays, everybody is a paparazzo,\u201d he says. \u201cEveryone is taking photos, everyone is recording. Nobody respects anybody\u2019s privacy, and not only my privacy as a celebrity, but yours. ...

I know [people are] going to say something. People know everything about me, so what\u2019s left for me to protect? My private life, my personal life,\u201d he tells the outlet. \u201cThat\u2019s the only answer. In the end, the only thing I have is my privacy.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cWe\u2019re in the worst time, the worst moment for the privacy of other humans; not just artists, but human beings. Today, no one respects the privacy or life of anyone. \u2026 I keep living. Fans are always going to want to know more, but I don\u2019t focus on that. I\u2019m always going to keep living my way.\u201d\n\nJune 20, 2023: They coordinate outfits during a night out with friends.\n\nWhile getting sushi with a group of friends, Jenner and Bad Bunny both wear white T-shirts.
