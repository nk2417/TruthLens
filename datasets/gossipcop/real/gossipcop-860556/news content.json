No matter how many partners you share or steal, how many backing dancers you tempt away, how much astonishingly unsubtle shade you throw online\u2026 there will always be friendship in the end.\n\nThat\u2019s assuming, anyway, that the Katy Perry-Taylor Swift feud, which now dates back almost a decade, is truly over \u2013 and that d\u00e9tente was accomplished with only a (literal) olive branch, a plate of baked goods, and now a hug at the climax of Swift's new video for You Need To Calm Down.\n\nWho needs Game of Thrones? Here\u2019s a complete timeline \u2013 and please, let it be complete \u2013 of how two queens of the pop world began, maintained and resolved an unspeakably petty, but quite elaborate, dispute.\n\nStrap in.\n\nJuly 2009: Taylor Swift shares the love\n\nWe begin in 2009, when Swift was on the rise as a pop star, but was still recognised as a country singer. Kanye West\u2019s pro-Beyonc\u00e9 stage invasion at the MTV VMAs, which would still be a live wire for Swift in 2016 \u2013 sit tight, we\u2019ll get there \u2013 was several months away.\n\nPerry, meanwhile, was fresh off a tour backed by her breakthrough hit I Kissed a Girl, and racking up international accolades. (The MTV VMAs would be eventful for her, too: she met her husband-to-be Russell Brand at the ceremony.)", "images":
