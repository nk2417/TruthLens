Grissom starred with Feldman and the late Corey Haim in two films: \u201cLicense to Drive\u201d and \u201cDream a Little Dream.\u201d\n\nFeldman launched a campaign last month to finance a documentary that would expose the alleged pedophiles in Hollywood. He\u2019s seeking $10 million to fund the film, and pay for attorneys and security for his own protection.\n\n\u201cThat is him,\u201d Feldman said Thursday on \u201cThe Dr. Oz Show\u201d as the host held up a photo of Grissom on his phone. \u201cThat\u2019s the guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis guy, on his Myspace page and his Facebook page has pictures of me and Corey Haim,\u201d Feldman said. \u201cHe still taunts it and flaunts it.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe actor had mentioned the alleged assaulter in his 2013 memoir, \u201cCoreyography,\u201d but changed his name to \u201cRon Crimson\u201d for legal purposes.\n\n\u201cThe lawyers made me change the names,\u201d Feldman added. \u201cThey gave me a list of three or four names. I picked the one that sounded closest to his name.\u201d\n\nOz and Feldman then called the Los Angeles Police Department to report the allegations.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me like they are going to take it seriously,\u201d Feldman said. \u201cThey are going to do an interview with me when I get back to Los Angeles. However, they did give me the warning that based on the statute of limitations, they can only open an investigation, but they cannot promise that it will be prosecuted.\u201d\n\nThe show later released a video saying its attorneys believe Grissom was imprisoned in 2003 for child molestation and is a \u201cfugitive from justice\u201d because he never registered as a sex offender.\n\nLast week on \u201cMegyn Kelly Today,\u201d Feldman named former talent manager and convicted sex offender Marty Weiss, who he had also referred to in his memoir, as another abuser. He then teased a different name, saying, \u201cThe second one ran a child\u2019s club in Hollywood \u2026 he\u2019s working for the L.A.
