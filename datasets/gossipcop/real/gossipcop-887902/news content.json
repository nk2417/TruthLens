Because the national team training camps did not allow parents to be present, my mom and dad were unable to observe what Nassar was doing, and this has imposed a terrible and undeserved burden of guilt on my loving family. Larry Nassar deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison, not only because of what he did to me, my teammates and so many other little girls; he needs to be behind bars so he will never prey upon another child. I urge you to impose the maximum sentence upon him. Ever since I went public with my story I\u2019ve been inspired and uplifted by the love and support of my former teammates, fans and many other good people. People should know that sexual abuse of children is not just happening in Hollywood, in the media and the halls of Congress. This is happening everywhere. Wherever there\u2019s a position of power, there seems to be a potential for abuse. I had a dream to go to the Olympics, and the things that I had to endure to get there were unnecessary and disgusting.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/0506a910-f3bb-4271-b4a6-36cf071f5c9f.png&h=196&w=196", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/files/2017/10/gymnast051352995211.jpg&w=1440", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/dr/resources/images/generic-newsletter-signup.png"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/files/2017/10/gymnast051352995211.jpg&w=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matt Bonesteel"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/01/18/i-thought-i-was-going-to-die-in-statement-mckayla-maroney-recalls-sexual-abuse-by-larry-nassar/", "title": "\u2018I thought I was going to die\u2019: In statement, McKayla Maroney recalls sexual abuse by Larry Nassar", "meta_data": {"description": "The 2012 Olympic gold medalist says Nassar began abusing her at the age of 13.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/01/18/i-thought-i-was-going-to-die-in-statement-mckayla-maroney-recalls-sexual-abuse-by-larry-nassar/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/files/2017/10/gymnast051352995211.jpg&w=1440", "title": "\u2018I thought I was going to die\u2019: In statement, McKayla Maroney recalls sexual abuse by Larry Nassar", "description": "The 2012 Olympic gold medalist says Nassar began abusing her at the age of 13."}, "og_site_name": "The Washington Post", "og_type": "article", "og_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/01/18/i-thought-i-was-going-to-die-in-statement-mckayla-maroney-recalls-sexual-abuse-by-larry-nassar/", "og_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/files/2017/10/gymnast051352995211.jpg&w=1440", "og_title": "\u2018I thought I was going to die\u2019: In statement, McKayla Maroney recalls sexual abuse by Larry Nassar", "og_description": "The 2012 Olympic gold medalist says Nassar began abusing her at the age of 13.", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018I thought I was going to die\u2019: In statement, McKayla Maroney recalls sexual abuse by Larry Nassar", "description": "The 2012 Olympic gold medalist says Nassar began abusing her at the age of 13."}, "last_updated_date": "2021-11-27T05:47:22.933Z", "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-18T19:09:45.000Z", "modified_time": "2021-11-27T05:47:22.933Z", "section": "Sports", "content_tier": "metered"}, "article_published_time": "2018-01-18T19:09:45.000Z", "article_modified_time": "2021-11-27T05:47:22.933Z", "article_section": "Sports", "article_content_tier": "metered", "og_author": "Matt Bonesteel", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "next-head-count": 88, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=352509417, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2018/01/18/i-thought-i-was-going-to-die-in-statement-mckayla-maroney-recalls-sexual-abuse-by-larry-nassar/?sourceApp=apple-banner"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516251600.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
