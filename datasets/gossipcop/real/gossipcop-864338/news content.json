Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live? In the shadows people see you as happy and free, because that\u2019s what you want them to see. Living two lifes, happy but not free. You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or someone you love,\u201d Jay-Z\u2019s mother said on \u201cSmile.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world is changing and they say it\u2019s time to be free,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut you live with the fear of just being me. Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be. No harm for them, no harm for me. But life is short, and it\u2019s time to be free. Love who you love, because life isn\u2019t guaranteed.\u201d\n\nGLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis issued a statement praising Gloria Carter\u2019s revelation. \u201cLesbian women are all too often erased or excluded from narratives surrounding LGBTQ people,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBy sharing her truth with the world, Gloria Carter is increasing visibility of lesbian women of color at a critical time and sending a powerful message of empowerment to the entire LGBTQ community that is perfectly timed with the end of Pride Month.\u201d\n\nIn a 2012 interview with CNN, Jay-Z spoke out in support of same-sex marriage, the Huffington Post notes.\n\nTrending Stories Kevin Spacey Says He Has 'No Home' After Sexual Misconduct Allegations 2025 CMA Awards: The Complete Winners List \u2018Faith Is Under Attack': Nicki Minaj Spreads Misleading Information at the United Nations Neighbor Indicted in Murder of \u2018King of the Hill\u2019 Star Jonathan Joss\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always thought [not allowing same-sex marriages] was still holding the country back,\u201d Jay-Z said at the time. \u201cWhat people do in their own homes is their business and you can choose to love whoever you love. That\u2019s their business. [It] is no different than discriminating against blacks. It\u2019s discrimination plain and simple.\u201d\n\nThe rapper\u2019s deeply personal 4:44 also finds him apologizing to Beyonce over his past infidelities and lashing out at the Prince estate.", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-jay-z-gloria-carter-7312d276-9d36-4861-821b-a453bbc649d2.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-jay-z-gloria-carter-7312d276-9d36-4861-821b-a453bbc649d2.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Kreps", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/jay-zs-mother-comes-out-on-444-song-smile-252950/", "title": "Jay-Z\u2019s Mother Comes Out on \u20184:44\u2019 Song \u2018Smile\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Jay-Z's mother Gloria Carter revealed for the first time that she is a lesbian on \"Smile,\" with the rapper also opening up about his mom's sexuality.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Daniel Kreps", "tags": "Jay-Z", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jay-Z's Mother Comes Out on '4:44' Song 'Smile'", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/jay-zs-mother-comes-out-on-444-song-smile-252950/", "description": "Jay-Z's mother Gloria Carter revealed for the first time that she is a lesbian on \"Smile,\" with the rapper also opening up about his mom's sexuality.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-jay-z-gloria-carter-7312d276-9d36-4861-821b-a453bbc649d2.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1", "width": 1500, "height": 900, "alt": "Jay-Z's Mother Comes Out on '4:44' Track 'Smile'"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-30T16:25:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T16:40:34+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jay-Z's mother Gloria Carter revealed for the first time that she is a lesbian on \"Smile,\" with the rapper also opening up about his mom's sexuality.", "site": "@RollingStone", "creator": "@danielkreps", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jay-Z\u2019s Mother Comes Out on \u20184:44\u2019 Song \u2018Smile\u2019", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-jay-z-gloria-carter-7312d276-9d36-4861-821b-a453bbc649d2.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498839945.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
