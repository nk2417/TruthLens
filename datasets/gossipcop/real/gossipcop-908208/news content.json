The rest is history.\u201d\n\nWilder was initially reluctant to propose, fearing he would get his heart broken again, but eventually did so on an episode of Wags Atlanta.\n\nHe said: \u201cI love the girl, though. She got my heart. That\u2019s my baby, that\u2019s my best friend.\n\n\u201cEven though I know I got a real woman and I love her to death, I know that I could give my all to a person and still get f****d over.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m definitely not closed-minded about it, because like I said, I found my best friend.\u201d\n\nThe proposal, on February 15, 2018, was timed to coincide with their child\u2019s gender reveal party, when they found out they were having a daughter.\n\nBreak-up\n\nWilder and Telli\u2019s relationship deteriorated over several years, culminating in a highly public breakup in 2025.\n\nThe split was marked by allegations of domestic violence and legal action.\n\nIn April 2025, Telli was seen moving on with NFL player John Johnson III, while she and WIlder were both embroiled in ongoing court proceedings.\n\nIn June 2024, Telli filed for, and was granted, a temporary restraining order against Wilder in Los Angeles.\n\nIt stated that Wilder must stay at least 100 yards away from Telli, their daughter, and her son until a scheduled court date in June 2025, which was reportedly on the 25th \u2014 however, nothing has been reported about the outcome as of June 27, 2025.\n\nTelli accused Wilder of repeated physical abuse, including choking her at least five times since 2018 \u2014 once in front of their children \u2014 spitting on her and nearly suffocating her by pressing her face into a pillow, per TMZ.\n\nAccording to multiple outlets, she also alleged that Wilder slammed her son\u2019s head against a car, accessed her laptop without consent, sent disturbing messages to her contacts, used home surveillance to spy on her and threw her out of their Atlanta residence shortly after she underwent surgery in April 2024.\n\nTelli claimed Wilder subjected her to constant ridicule, threats to destroy her belongings and coercive sexual demands, expecting intercourse \u201cmultiple times a day\u201d, as reported by Marca.\n\nShe expressed fear for her safety, particularly after Wilder\u2019s devastating loss to Zhilei Zhang in June 2024, stating that his emotional state and history of violence made her believe he could become physically violent.\n\nIn her application for the order, Telli said: \u201cI believe Deontay is capable of being physically violent towards me upon his return in June because he has expressed that he is furious with me since April and has been physically abusive with me in the past.\u201d\n\nWilder\u2019s divorce from Jessica Scales-Wilder\n\nWilder married Jessica Scales in 2009 and proceeded to have four children with her \u2014 two sons and two daughters.\n\nTheir eldest child, Naieya, has spina bifida, with the boxer often calling her an inspiration as she battles the disability.\n\nThe three others are called Ava, Deontay Jr, and Dereon.\n\nWilder reportedly had an affair with Telli Swift, and eventually divorced Jessica in 2017 after eight years of marriage.\n\nSince then, Jessica has kept a low profile, focusing on being a mum to her children.", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/l-deontay-wilder-attend-heavyweight-562212684.jpg?strip=all&w=211", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/NINTCHDBPICT000475630271.jpg?strip=all&w=208", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/l-television-personality-telli-swift-452423032.jpg?strip=all&w=300", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NINTCHDBPICT000452422458.jpg?strip=all&w=296", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ac-horoscope-daily-04-thursday.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/image-684172d55d.jpg?quality=90&strip=all", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RAS-SPORT-PREVIEW-CONOR-BENN-TATTOOS-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/silhouette-soldier-patrolling-1027725603_691656.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/l-television-personality-telli-swift-452423032-e1751021202258.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C59px%2C3000px%2C2001px&resize=1920%2C1080", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SPL5524402_003_Deontay-Wilder-and-Telli-Swift-were-spotted-holding-hands-as-arriving-at-Catch-Steak.jpg?strip=all&w=702"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/l-television-personality-telli-swift-452423032-e1751021202258.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C59px%2C3000px%2C2001px&resize=1920%2C1080", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/7804275/deontay-wilder-fiancee-telli-swift-divorced-jessica-scales/", "title": "Who is Deontay Wilder\u2019s ex-fiancee Telli Swift?", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
