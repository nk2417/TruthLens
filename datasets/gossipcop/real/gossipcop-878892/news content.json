Such activity would usually provide an opportunity for some hyperbole about the internet collectively \u201closing it,\u201d but Mayer already took care of that for everyone by further replying, \u201cPlease hold, losing my shit. This isn\u2019t my reply yet.\u201d\n\nThanks to Safaree Samuels and Meek Mill, even non-Nicki fans probably know more about Nicki Minaj\u2019s love life than they care to publicly admit. Mayer is no slouch in that department either, as Taylor Swift added him to her pantheon of jilted ex-boyfriend songs with 2010\u2019s \u201cDear John.\u201d\n\nCelebrities making googly eyes at each other via Twitter isn\u2019t exactly groundbreaking, given that Nicki has been on the receiving end of two fake marriage proposals courtesy of Drake and DJ Khaled. But if you need a break from the current news cycle of back-to-back hurricanes, the possible threat of a nuclear stare down, and the proposed end of DACA, then peruse Nicki Minaj and John Mayer\u2019s respective Twitter feeds for a break from reality.", "images": ["https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723867954/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-457-1670482444-45_16x9-6492582", "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,c_fill,ar_1.55,w_2048,g_auto/v1723867953/sanity-new/john-mayer-interview-xm-133469966.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723867954/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-457-1670482444-45_16x9-6492582", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Omar Burgess"], "canonical_link": "https://www.complex.com/music/a/omar-burgess/john-mayer-nicki-minaj-twitter", "title": "John Mayer Tried to Shoot his Shot With Nicki Minaj", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Brace yourself for a \"Your Body is a Wonderland\" pun courtesy of Nicki. | Complex", "og": {"title": "John Mayer Tried to Shoot his Shot With Nicki Minaj", "description": "Brace yourself for a \"Your Body is a Wonderland\" pun cour...", "url": "https://www.complex.com/music/a/omar-burgess/john-mayer-nicki-minaj-twitter", "site_name": "Complex", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723867954/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-457-1670482444-45_16x9-6492582", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "@complex", "id": 13049362}, "title": "John Mayer Tried to Shoot his Shot With Nicki Minaj", "description": "Brace yourself for a \"Your Body is a Wonderland\" pun courtesy of Nicki. | Complex", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723867954/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-457-1670482444-45_16x9-6492582"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.complex.com", "summary": ""}
