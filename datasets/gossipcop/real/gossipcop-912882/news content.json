It's not about weight,\" she shares. \"I've never even weighed myself. I don't think you can trust the scale.\"\n\n\"Exercise is about how I feel. I have more energy when I work out. It makes me amped for the rest of the day, and I feel strong,\" she added.\n\nMark Williams + Sara Hirakawa/SHAPE\n\nAs much as she loves to exercise, the 30-year-old actress also loves to indulge, admitting that she's all about creating balance in her life.\n\n\"I think having healthy skin [also] comes from being happy and having a balanced life. I work hard, I play hard; I eat a lot, I work out a lot,\" she says. \"I'm not the kind of person who says 'I eat pizza' but then doesn't really eat it. I eat the pizza! And I don't stress out about it.\"\n\n\"I've learned that as long as you're moving, you can have the food you want,\" she continues. \"Every one of us has insecurities. I have a whole bunch of them, but I don\u2019t dwell on them. Instead I focus on my strengths. After all, what\u2019s the worst thing that can happen if you try something new and it doesn\u2019t work out? So what?\"\n\nThat confidence has allowed Mitchell to pursue different opportunities, no matter how much they may scare her. \"You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to be good at until you do it! The same goes for travel: Explore the world; don\u2019t be afraid of it. Get out there and be adventurous -- that\u2019s my life motto,\" she expresses.\n\nSee more on Mitchell in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-12/ashley_benson_shay_mitchell_gettyimages-519644660.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/shay-mitchell-shape-magazine-cover-march-2018-inline.jpg?h=832a653d", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_shaymitchell_091317.png?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-09/shay_mitchell_gettyimages-843922540.jpg?h=665cf7b9&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/shay-mitchell-shape-magazine-cover-march-2018-inline.jpg?h=832a653d&width=1024&quality=80"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/shay-mitchell-shape-magazine-cover-march-2018-inline.jpg?h=832a653d", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/shay-mitchell-says-shes-never-weighed-herself-96144", "title": "Shay Mitchell Says She's 'Never' Weighed Herself", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/shay-mitchell-shape-magazine-cover-march-2018-inline.jpg?h=832a653d", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 30-year-old actress covers the March issue of 'SHAPE' Magazine.", "title": "Shay Mitchell Says She's 'Never' Weighed Herself", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/shay-mitchell-says-shes-never-weighed-herself-96144", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 30-year-old actress covers the March issue of 'SHAPE' Magazine.", "twitter": {"description": "The 30-year-old actress covers the March issue of 'SHAPE' Magazine.", "title": "Shay Mitchell Says She's 'Never' Weighed Herself", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/shay-mitchell-says-shes-never-weighed-herself-96144", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/shay-mitchell-shape-magazine-cover-march-2018-inline.jpg?h=832a653d", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Shay Mitchell Says She's 'Never' Weighed Herself  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Shay Mitchell, Health, Health & Wellness", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
