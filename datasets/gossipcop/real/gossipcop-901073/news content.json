Teefey posted throwback photos, including one of Gomez putting her hand on her mom's baby bump, as well as one of her holding Gomez as a baby.\n\n\"Thank you to all the fans who honored our Scarlett yesterday,\" Teefey wrote. \"Dec 17th will never be the same, but we decide to celebrate her by writing her letters on red balloons and releasing them.\"\n\nTeefey also noted that Monday marked the end of filming season two of her and Gomez's Netflix hit 13 Reasons Why, and that Scarlett \"was there in spirit, as always.\" The producer also gave a shout-out to her husband, Brian, and their 4-year-old daughter Gracie.\n\n\"A mom's love for their children is pretty fierce,\" Teefey wrote. \"In order of my girls, Selena, Scarlett and Gracie. Family is what matters, blood or not, #family13 made me smile and feel loved when so needed and they didn\u2019t know. Then, I came home to Brian and Gracie to send our love to Scarlett. Fans, I want you to know you are family because I have a huge family and you are the only ones who remember! XO forever.\"\n\nET spoke to Teefey in March at the Los Angeles premiere of 13 Reasons Why, where she opened up about why the show's subject matter hit home for her.\n\n\"I was a teen mom with Selena, obviously, and was very judged by that, even by my counselors and my teachers [who said] that I failed and just let go of it,\" she said. \"My neighborhood was a really rough neighborhood [with] gangs. With all of that stuff, and when I got pregnant, I think that's what triggered, because I was like, 'OK, I have another person depending on me. I gotta get straight,' and that's when I started hammering through. I'm like, 'I'm not going to let her have the upbringing I did.' I kind of kept powering through -- you get used to it.\"\n\nWatch below:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-03/1280_selena_gomez_mandy_teefey_getty661230306.jpg?h=430c8cf6&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-03/1280_selena_gomez_mandy_teefey_getty661230306.jpg?h=430c8cf6", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-04/et_041617_ChellaDay2_4_720.png?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2012-11/selena_gomez_justin_Bieber_.jpg?width=256&quality=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-03/1280_selena_gomez_mandy_teefey_getty661230306.jpg?h=430c8cf6", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/selena-gomezs-mom-pens-emotional-post-honoring-daughter-she-lost-miscarriage-92950", "title": "Selena Gomez's Mom Pens Emotional Post Honoring Daughter She Lost to Miscarriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-03/1280_selena_gomez_mandy_teefey_getty661230306.jpg?h=430c8cf6", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey, is paying tribute to the child she lost to miscarriage in 2011.", "title": "Selena Gomez's Mom Pens Emotional Post Honoring Daughter She Lost to Miscarriage", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/selena-gomezs-mom-pens-emotional-post-honoring-daughter-she-lost-miscarriage-92950", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey, is paying tribute to the child she lost to miscarriage in 2011.", "twitter": {"description": "Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey, is paying tribute to the child she lost to miscarriage in 2011.", "title": "Selena Gomez's Mom Pens Emotional Post Honoring Daughter She Lost to Miscarriage", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/selena-gomezs-mom-pens-emotional-post-honoring-daughter-she-lost-miscarriage-92950", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-03/1280_selena_gomez_mandy_teefey_getty661230306.jpg?h=430c8cf6", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Selena Gomez's Mom Pens Emotional Post Honoring Daughter She Lost to Miscarriage | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Selena Gomez, Mandy Teefey", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
