Mary Drake sent her to a wealthy family in London, thinking she would have a great life, but instead, Alex ended up at an orphanage and never had a real family. Her lack of family, in comparison to Spencer\u2019s seemingly \u201cperfect\u201d life, is what prompted her to take down the Liars.\n\nAlex showed up in Tuesday night\u2019s finale and locked up Spencer with a plan to pose as her sister for the rest of her life. Of course, that didn\u2019t happen because the Liars and the men of Rosewood came together to crack the case at the last minute, and all lived happily ever after.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nHere, \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d creator Marlene King speaks to Variety about the series finale\u2026\n\nHow long was this the plan for Spencer to have a twin and for the twin to be A.D.?\n\nWe started talking about it before Charlotte\u2019s death so between 5B and 6A, and I knew we couldn\u2019t continue the story until we knew what that ultimate ending was going to be \u2014 if we\u2019re going to bring in a new \u201cA,\u201d we\u2019re going to have to know who it is and why it\u2019s happening before starting the story.\n\nAside from Alex Drake, can you confirm once and for all, who was the full A-team?\n\nFor the first two seasons, it was Mona. She\u2019s original \u201cA.\u201d And then Charlotte stole it from her and she\u2019s \u201cBig A.\u201d And then the death of Charlotte was the genesis for \u201cA.D.\u201d\n\nHave you been keeping up with all of the fan reaction to the finale on social media?\n\nI haven\u2019t been online, to be honest with you. I\u2019m intentionally staying off of social media for a couple of days to give myself a breather.\n\nHow many times did we see Alex as Spencer through the course of the series?\n\nI think her first time on-screen was when Hanna was being tortured in the shed and she dreamt that Spencer came to her to reassure her and give her a clue to get out, that was Alex. After Yvonne died and Toby was leaving town and Spencer came to say goodbye to Toby and asked for a kiss, that was Alex. We saw Alex wearing an argyle sweater in the Hastings home looking at family photographs. Two episodes ago, when Spencer went to go visit Toby in the cabin and they had that crazy wild sex, that was Alex.\n\nThat\u2019s so twisted, Marlene!\n\nI know. [Laughing] Sorry! Spoby fans were not happy.\n\nWhen you told Troian that she would be playing \u201cUber A,\u201d what was her reaction and what went into the prep work to master two characters?\n\nShe was amazing. She knew for two years and then we started honing in about a year ago on the real backstory of the character, so she\u2019s been working on that dialect for a long time and she really did her homework.\n\nHow did the other girls react when they found out it would be Troian playing \u201cA.D.\u201d ultimately?\n\nWe didn\u2019t tell anyone. Troian wanted to keep it a secret because she didn\u2019t want people to know it was \u201cA.D.\u201d when they were acting in those scenes. Little by little, some people started to figure it out. By the time it was Alex Drake and Toby having sex in episode 18, some people started to put it together, but we didn\u2019t confirm or deny anything.\n\nWhat was that first table read like when Troian finally came out as \u201cA.D?\u201d\n\nPeople loved it. At that table read, I didn\u2019t really know what to expect because Troian had to play Alex Drake and Spencer, and so she was playing these scenes with herself at the table read. People were on the edge of their seats and I knew it was going to work. Even the table read wasn\u2019t easy to pull off.\n\nSpencer\u2019s parents didn\u2019t know she had a twin, correct?\n\nThat is correct. Veronica and Peter did not know.\n\nMona is always so hard to read, but should we believe that she was actually always on the Liars\u2019 side for this season?\n\nDefinitely for the first two seasons, she was \u201cA.\u201d But then I think she wanted to be Hanna\u2019s friend in these final seasons.\n\nCan you speak to Mona\u2019s final scene when she had Alex and Mary Drake in the dollhouse in France? What should viewers take away from that?\n\nWe really just wanted to give the story a twist on a twist, and I really wanted to give Mona a happy ending and something that honestly was just really fun. She always loved France, she was always playing those records, so it makes sense that she would go to France with her hottie and play grown-up dollies with these two characters.\n\nSpencer\u2019s sister, Melissa, was always a fan-favorite theory to be \u201cUber A.\u201d Can you explain what her involvement was in all of this, if at all?\n\nShe killed Bethany Young. Melissa was responsible for that murder, but she did it to protect her sister. But other than being a greedy older sister, that\u2019s really her only thing \u2014 she really wasn\u2019t that evil.\n\nAll of the couples end up together in the end \u2014 was that always the plan?\n\nIt really was. I\u2019m a total romantic at heart. The path was bumpy and curvy, but I always knew these couples would end up together. The relationships are so important to our fans and they were so patient, so I thought it was really important to give them that.\n\nThe finale alludes to Spencer and Toby being together, but in your mind, what are they doing right now?\n\nThey\u2019re living in the city and he\u2019s building houses for homeless vets, and she\u2019s commuting to Rosewood because she\u2019s an attorney now working at Hastings & Hastings with her mom. And they\u2019re engaged.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/145069_0649-900x0.jpg?w=900&h=600&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/145069_0649-900x0.jpg?w=900&h=563&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/145069_0649-900x0.jpg?w=900&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elizabeth Wagmeister", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/pretty-little-liars-finale-recap-interview-spencer-twin-alex-drake-1202481209/", "title": "\u2018Pretty Little Liars\u2019 Creator Breaks Down Major \u2018A\u2019 Reveal in Series Finale (SPOILERS)", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Marlene King talks to Variety about the big reveal in the series finale with Troian Bellisario.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Elizabeth Wagmeister", "tags": "Freeform, Marlene King, Pretty Little Liars", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Pretty Little Liars\u2019 Creator Breaks Down Major \u2018A\u2019 Reveal in Series Finale (SPOILERS)", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/pretty-little-liars-finale-recap-interview-spencer-twin-alex-drake-1202481209/", "description": "Marlene King talks to Variety about the big reveal in the series finale with Troian Bellisario.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/145069_0649-900x0.jpg?w=900&h=563&crop=1", "width": 900, "height": 563, "alt": "Pretty Little Liars finale"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-28T18:39:54+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-28T19:09:25+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Marlene King talks to Variety about the big reveal in the series finale with Troian Bellisario.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@EWagmeister", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Pretty Little Liars\u2019 Creator Breaks Down Major \u2018A\u2019 Reveal in Series Finale (SPOILERS)", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/145069_0649-900x0.jpg?w=900&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/e1-04RRjt8s?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1498675194.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
