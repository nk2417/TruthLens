{"url": "https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-rob-blac-chyna-drama/", "text": "Months after Rob Kardashian\u2018s drama with Blac Chyna reached its explosive peak, the aftermath is being documented on Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nIn a preview of Sunday\u2019s episode, sisters Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian sit down to discuss their brother\u2019s bitter legal battle with his ex-fianc\u00e9e, which began after he posted graphic and expletive-ridden content about her on social media in July \u2014 including three naked photos \u2014 while accusing her of drug use, alcohol abuse and infidelity.\n\n\u201cDid you see how I just went off on Rob in our group text?\u201d says Kim, 37. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take it.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9, 33, points out that there\u2019s a \u201cplus and a minus\u201d to the situation \u2014 with the plus side being that there\u2019s \u201cno way\u201d Rob, 30, and Chyna, 29, could \u201cget back together after this.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s focus on the positive,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 says. \u201cThe negative is all of this other s\u2014 right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe negative is just that like, with Rob having sisters, he should just know better,\u201d Kim says. \u201cHe should have just like, controlled himself.\u201d\n\nBut Khlo\u00e9 is still in Rob\u2019s corner.\n\n\u201cIt just sucks,\u201d she tells Kim. \u201cHe\u2019s made out to [be] this bad guy when [Chyna] is taunting him. Love makes you do f\u2014ed up things. Do you think anyone\u2019s proud of that? No. You don\u2019t f\u2014 with someone\u2019s heart and emotions.\u201d\n\nAfter Rob\u2019s social media rampage, Chyna and her legal team accused him of violating California\u2019s revenge porn laws, claiming in court documents obtained by PEOPLE that he allegedly hit her and threatened to kill himself multiple times. A judge later granted her a set of restraining orders against her ex.\n\nHis actions launched a two-month-long custody war over their 14-month-old daughter Dream Ren\u00e9e. The two agreed to joint custody Sept. 15, PEOPLE confirmed \u2014 though at the time, Chyna\u2019s lawyer Lisa Bloom said the decision \u201cdoes not resolve all disputes between Chyna and Rob.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo Rob and Chyna have officially broken up, but they obviously still have to communicate for the custody of Dream,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 says in the sneak peek. \u201cThey\u2019re still having a hard time getting along. The legal battle that has been going on between the two of them has been super frustrating. I feel like this is escalating to a place that none of us could have ever imagined.\u201d\n\nIn September, Rob and his sister Kylie Jenner, 20, sued Chyna for battery, assault and vandalism, alleging she attempted to choke Kardashian with an iPhone cord during a fight in December 2016. (Jenner owns the home where the alleged altercation took place.)\n\nIn the complaint, the siblings alleged Chyna made a \u201cdeliberate attempt to extort the Kardashian family for her own monetary gains\u201d and claimed her decision to have a baby with Rob was \u201cnothing short of an outright fraud to shake down the Kardashian family.\u201d\n\nIn October, Chyna filed her own lawsuit against her ex for allegedly damaging her brand and verbally and physically abusing her. In the filing obtained by PEOPLE, Chyna claims she has suffered \u201csignificant damages\u201d from his social media posts. She alleged the nude photo scandal \u2014 along with influence from the Kardashian family \u2014 are what got Rob & Chyna, her and Rob\u2019s E! reality show, axed before a season 2.\n\nShe also accused Rob of physical abuse, alleging that her ex once grabbed her phone out of her hand and \u201cviolently knocked her to the ground where she landed on her hands and knees\u201d after she tried to call Tyga, with whom she shares 5-year-old son King Cairo and who previously dated Jenner for almost three years.\n\nRob, who denies the assault claims, and his family have requested that the case be dismissed. According to court documents filed Dec. 27 in the Superior Court of Los Angeles and obtained by The Blast, Rob \u201cgenerally and specifically denies each of the allegations\u201d and claimed Chyna \u201cdid not suffer any injury or harm as a result of any conduct by [Kardashian].\u201d\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE in response, Chyna\u2019s attorney said, \u201cWe are confident that we will prevail on this motion and at trial.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs this Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m. ET on E!", "images":
