While the past 20 years have just flown by, fans of the real-life fairytale franchise have never given up hope for a third Princess Diaries movie. In 2025, The Hollywood Reporter revealed in October 2024, the project will finally be filming.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, traction on a trilogy-making sequel has stalled\u2014but has not stopped completely. Anne Hathaway, who played plucked-from-obscurity princess Mia Thermopolis, previously confirmed a script exists, and while she claimed to be on board for the film alongside co-star Julie Andrews as Queen Clarisse, there hadn\u2019t been many updates since. Then Disney officially greenlit a new installment in November 2022.\n\nAs The Princess Diaries taught us, miracles happen once in a while if you believe. Ahead, everything we know about the status of Princess Diaries 3, including Chris Pine\u2019s involvement, Mandy Moore\u2019s surprising character theories, and the latest update Hathaway offered in April 2024.\n\nDisney signed on for a Princess Diaries 3 in 2022.\n\nDisney has signed on for a third installment, The Hollywood Reporter announced on Nov. 15, 2022. TV writer Aadrita Mukerji (Reacher, Supergirl) is penning the script. The film will be a continuation of the Princess Diaries story rather than a reboot.\n\nAnne Hathaway\u2019s involvement is not yet confirmed, but \u201cthe hope is she would return should the potential new film move forward beyond the script stage,\u201d per THR. She has vocally supported the idea of a third Princess Diaries film, telling Entertainment Tonight in October, \u201cI would more than entertain it, I\u2019m pulling for it. If there\u2019s any way to get Julie Andrews involved, I think we would make it work. We would go to where she was and put a green screen behind her and just make it happen.\u201d\n\nDebra Martin Chase, who produced the first two films, will produce the new installment and Melissa Stack (The Other Woman) will executive produce.\n\nJoy Ride\u2019s Adele Lim is now set to direct the film.\n\nThe Princess Diaries 3 finally has a director. The Hollywood Reporter shared on October 4 that Lim has been hired to helm the project. Hathaway is expected to return, the outlet added, and Disney hopes to film the movie in 2025.\n\nLim shared a statement to the outlet about her appointment: \u201cAs a diehard fan of the original Princess Diaries, I\u2019m beyond excited to be a part of bringing the third iteration of this beloved franchise to life. We look forward to celebrating its core tenants of female power, joy and mentorship with audiences worldwide.\u201d\n\nThe film\u2019s status has been up in the air.\n\nOn March 14, 2024, Julie Andrews admitted that she believes plans for the third film have been scrapped.\n\n\u201cAh, I have been asked that so many times,\u201d she told Today after being asked if there will be a Princess Diaries 3.\n\n\u201cThere was dialogue about it,\u201d she continued, adding that \u201cnothing had been realized. And I think I may be wrong, but I think it\u2019s been shelved now. I can\u2019t be sure.\u201d\n\nThat said, Andrews also stated that she\u2019s \u201csure there will be another version on another day.\u201d\n\nAfter pausing for a moment, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s quite a long time now since the two Diaries were done, and I\u2019m not sure, but sometimes it\u2019s best to leave a good thing alone. I don\u2019t like it when people milk and milk and milk the subject, you know, \u2019til it\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nShe is still interested in reprising her role as Queen Clarisse though. \u201cI\u2019d be very happy if we did do another one, but I don\u2019t expect to,\u201d Andrews finished.\n\nHathaway offered encouraging news about the project in April 2024.\n\nHathaway told V magazine in late April that The Princess Diaries 3 remains in the works. \u201cWe\u2019re in a good place. That\u2019s all I can say,\u201d she teased. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to announce yet. But we\u2019re in a good place.\u201d\n\nShe confirmed her participation in October 2024.\n\nOn Oct. 4, Hathaway shared a screenshot of the film announcement then some clips of herself from the film with Julie Andrews, before blowing a kiss at the camera and saying, \u201cShut up!\u201d\n\n\u201cMiracles happen,\u201dshe captioned the video. \u201cBack to Genovia with @adeleblim @disney @somewherepictures. The fairy tale continues.\u201d\n\nThe film has been discussed for years.\n\nQueen Andrews herself gave an update in 2020. During a virtual interview with The Talk in April, the Oscar winner managed to both inspire optimism and cast doubt when it comes to PD3. \u201cI heard that there might be one,\u201d she revealed. \u201cIt\u2019s long been talked about but nothing sort of been on my desk or anything like that. I think I would [do it]. I\u2019m getting awfully old and crotchety. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the right timing, but I think to work with Annie [Anne Hathaway, who played Princess Mia] would be lovely again, and sure I\u2019d be up for it. I think we should wait for\u2014if a script comes in, let\u2019s wait for that. Of course, we wouldn\u2019t have the wonderful Gary Marshall who was the director. He\u2019s passed. And he was really the nuts and bolts of it all.\u201d\n\nHathaway was asked about the status of the project during her January 2019 appearance on Watch What Happens Live. She wants it to happen. Julie Andrews wants it to happen. They\u2019re working on it, she confirmed. \u201cThere is a script for the third movie.... There is a script,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to do it. Julie [Andrews] wants to do it. Debra Martin Chase, our producer, wants to do it. We all really want it to happen. It\u2019s just we don\u2019t want to unless it\u2019s perfect, because we love it just as much as you guys love it. It\u2019s as important to us as it is to you, and we don\u2019t want to deliver anything until it\u2019s ready, but we\u2019re working on it, so...\u201d\n\nPrior to Hathaway confirming there was a script, the author of The Princess Diaries book series, Meg Cabot, told Entertainment Weekly in 2017 that a script exists. She also said that if the movie gets made, it\u2019ll happen \u201ckind of as a tribute\u201d to director Garry Marshall, who passed away in 2016. But Cabot refused to reveal any further details, apart from saying that the movies would likely deviate from the book series. She said, \u201cI think of them as two different universes.\u201d\n\nA potential plot was pointed to in August 2025.\n\nOn August 21, Adele Lim posted an open casting call for the role of Olivia, seeming to confirm that the newest installation will follow the events of Cabot\u2019s 2015 book, The Princess Diaries, Volume XI: Royal Wedding.\n\nDisney looking for a 15-year-old girl to play Olivia Robinson: \u201cSmart, sarcastic, armored, and observant, Olivia Robinson wants to be left alone. After her mother passed away, she withdrew into herself, masking her sadness with caustic wit. But under her prickly exterior, Olivia\u2019s natural warmth, compassion and courage to stand up to power is exactly what makes her a natural born leader The only thing standing in the way is herself.\u201d\n\nIn the book, Olivia is the half-sister of Mia Thermopolis from a secret relationship of her dad, Phillipe. Mia finds Olivia after her mother has passed away and fights for custody after discovering she is being mistreated by extended family members. There might be deviations from the book\u2019s plot, but it\u2019s clear they intend for Olivia to be a central character in the story.\n\nGarry Marshall was reportedly planning the third installment before he died.\n\nSpeaking of Marshall, the filmmaker was also passionate about a third movie about Princess Mia. In an interview with People in March 2016, Marshall said, \u201cI was with Anne Hathaway a couple weeks ago. It looks like we want to do The Princess Diaries 3 in Manhattan.\u201d Sadly, Marshall\u2019s plan never came to fruition, but it\u2019s possible that the sequel will still be set in New York to honor his idea.\n\nChris Pine is open to a third movie.\n\nThe actor seemed enthusiastic when asked about reprising his role as the dashing Nicholas Devereaux in 2016. After quite literally sweeping Mia off her feet at the end of the 2004 sequel, questions remain about the status of Nicholas and Mia\u2019s romance. During a fan Q&A for Entertainment Weekly in 2016, Pine was asked, \u201cDon\u2019t you pray every night for a Princess Diaries 3?\u201d To which he replied, \u201cHave you been reading my diary?\u201d\n\nGiulio Marcocchi // Getty Images Pine and Hathaway in 2004.\n\nMandy Moore would consider a cameo.\n\nIn July 2017, Moore, who played mean-girl cheerleader Lana, told ELLE.com, \u201cIf I\u2019m going to be involved, I would be down for a cameo\u2014maybe she could make amends with Mia and apologize for being a bully when she was younger. She was insecure, going through a difficult time in her life and [has now] reflected on why that wasn\u2019t okay.\u201d\n\nMoore also appeared on People Now in February 2019 and was asked what she would like to see for her character Lana. The actress had a pretty fleshed out answer: \u201cI would like to see if life kicked down a few pegs because she was the bully in school [if she comes back]. I\u2019d like to see her is life has come full circle and maybe she\u2019s a little more well humble. I would be down!\u201d\n\n\u00a9Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Everett Collection // Everett\n\nPrincess Mia\u2019s best friend Lilly Moscovitz would come back.\n\nIn July 2016, Heather Matarazzo, who played Princess Mia\u2019s best friend Lilly Moscovitz, told Cosmopolitan that she would definitely return for another sequel. She said, \u201cIf Annie and Julie are down, of course.\u201d\n\nThe fans are ready for a royal return.\n\nIf you had concerns about the fanbase returning for a third movie, allow X, formerly known as Twitter\u2019s, evergreen excitement to ease your mind.\n\nAs we await the official release, there\u2019s plenty of time to rewatch the first two movies, and reflect on Sandra Oh\u2019s Oscar-worthy turn as Vice Principal Gupta.\n\nAdditional reporting by Savannah Walsh and Alyssa Bailey", "images":
