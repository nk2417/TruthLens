{"url": "https://people.com/human-interest/united-airlines-10-policy-changes/", "text": "United Airlines has announced \u201csubstantial\u201d policy changes following the recent incident aboard a recent flight when a passenger was dragged off the plane.\n\n\u201cThe changes are the result of United\u2019s thorough examination of its policies and procedures, and commitment to take action, in the wake of the forced removal of a customer aboard United Express Flight 3411 on April 9,\u201d the statement on the airline\u2019s website read.\n\nThe airline says they will now limit law enforcement to safety and security issues. It will also not require customers seated on the plane to give up their seat involuntarily unless it poses a safety or security risk.\n\nCustomer compensation incentives for voluntarily giving up their original seats will be increased up to $10,000.\n\nThe full list of changes is below:\n\nLimit use of law enforcement to safety and security issues only.\n\nNot require customers seated on the plane to give up their seat involuntarily unless safety or security is at risk.\n\nIncrease customer compensation incentives for voluntary denied boarding up to $10,000.\n\nEstablish a customer solutions team to provide agents with creative solutions such as using nearby airports, other airlines or ground transportations to get customers to their final destination.\n\nEnsure crews are booked onto a flight at least 60 minutes prior to departure.\n\nProvide employees with additional annual training.\n\nCreate an automated system for soliciting volunteers to change travel plans.\n\nReduce the amount of overbooking.\n\nEmpower employees to resolve customer service issues in the moment.\n\nEliminate the red tape on permanently lost bags by adopting a \u201cno questions asked\u201d policy on lost luggage.\n\nThe CEO of United Airlines, Oscar Muniz, said in the statement, \u201cEvery customer deserves to be treated with the highest levels of service and the deepest sense of dignity and respect. Two weeks ago, we failed to meet that standard and we profoundly apologize. However, actions speak louder than words. Today, we are taking concrete, meaningful action to make things right and ensure nothing like this ever happens again.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Daughter of Dr. David Daughter Says Family Was \u201cSickened\u201d By United Airlines Incident\n\nOn April 9, Dr. David Dao was speaking to security personnel who told him to deplane after the airline overbooked the flight.\n\nIn a video of the incident taken by a fellow passenger, Dao could be heard telling personnel, \u201cI won\u2019t go, I\u2019m a physician I have to work tomorrow, 8 o\u2019clock\u2026\u201d\n\nAfter the officer on board told Dao they\u2019d have to \u201cdrag\u201d him off, the 69-year-old doctor responded by saying he flew from Los Angeles and would \u201crather go to jail\u201d than be forced to depart the plane.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d rather go to jail than just get off?\u201d questions the officer.\n\nAnother video of the incident taken later shows Dao bloodied and bruised as officials with the Chicago Department of Aviation dragged him through the aisle of the aircraft.", "images":
