She added that the misleading promos include \u201clies\u201d about her leaving \u201cNCIS\u201d to focus on cosmetics.\n\n\u201cThey caught \u2019em!\u201d the actress tweeted Thursday. \u201cHopefully these false ads will end now! I DON\u2019T have a skin care line!\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, she wrote, \u201cI\u2019M NOT LEAVING NCIS FOR A SKIN CARE LINE! I\u2019m leaving, but that\u2019s not why.\u201d\n\n\u201cNCIS\u201d fans have been struggling to grapple with Perrette\u2019s impending departure after she announced last month that the show\u2019s currently airing Season 15 will be her last. She has not given a specific reason for walking away.\n\nPerrette\u2019s latest tweet is below.\n\nThey caught \u2018em! Hopefully these false ads will end now! I DON\u2019T have a skin care line! https://t.co/wOmdRioUFy \u2014 Pauley Perrette (@PauleyP) November 15, 2017\n\n\u201cNCIS\u201d airs Tuesdays at 8/7c on CBS.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325_COVER-_IR_5x4.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/610384978.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/610384978.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Gajewski", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid", "Border-Radius Box-Shadow Rgba", "Rgba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/pauley-perrette-ncis-rejoices-exit-abby/", "title": "\u2018NCIS\u2019 Star Pauley Perrette Rejoices Over End to \u2018Lies\u2019 About Why She\u2019s Leaving Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'NCIS' Star Pauley Perrette Rejoices Over End to 'Lies' About Why She's Leaving Show", "description": "Actress has been outspoken amid confusion surrounding her departure", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/pauley-perrette-ncis-rejoices-exit-abby/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/610384978.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-16T01:36:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-16T18:40:45+00:00"}, "author": "Ryan Gajewski", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Ryan Gajewski", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "cbs, mark-harmon, ncis, pauley-perrette", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510796161.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
