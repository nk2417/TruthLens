{"url": "https://people.com/music/taylor-swift-call-it-what-you-want-new-song/", "text": "With just a week to go until Taylor Swift releases her highly anticipated album Reputation, the star gave her fans another peek at her new music Thursday night by dropping a new song titled \u201cCall It What You Want.\u201d\n\nThe latest single (read the full lyrics here) is the fourth song Swifties have heard from the singer\u2019s upcoming sixth studio album, Reputation, and reveals details about her romance with British actor Joe Alwyn.\n\nIn the first verse, Swift sings that her \u201ccastle crumbled overnight,\u201d likely referencing her drama-filled 2015 that saw high-profile breakups with Calvin Harris and Tom Hiddleston and a reignited feud with Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West.\n\n\u201cAll the liars are calling me one / Nobody\u2019s heard from me for months / I\u2019m doing better than I ever was,\u201d she continues. After performing at a Super Bowl party in February, the star largely went under the radar for the rest of 2016 and secretly dated Alwyn for months before news of the relationship went public.\n\n\u201cMy baby\u2019s fly like a jet stream/ High above the whole scene/ Loves me like I\u2019m brand new so call me what you want, yeah,\u201d the Grammy winner sings about her boyfriend.\n\n\u201cI want to wear his initial on a chain around my neck, not because he owns me/ but \u2018cause he really knows me,\u201d Swift also sings.\n\nWhile promoting the song on her social media accounts early Friday morning, Swift shared videos from her life over the last year.\n\nSnapshots included her singing an acoustic version of the song, relaxing at her Rhode Island home, riding a horse, enjoying a bonfire, painting a watercolor, sipping on wine, hanging out with her mom\u2019s dog Kitty, recording new music and celebrating her birthday.\n\nThe Grammy winner, 27, teased the track Thursday morning on her Instagram account, posting select lyrics that immediately had fans speculating if it was a follow-up to her 2008 smash hit \u201cLove Story.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cLove Story,\u201d Swift sings: \u201cRomeo, take me somewhere we can be alone / I\u2019ll be waiting, all that\u2019s left to do is run / You\u2019ll be the prince and I\u2019ll be the princess / It\u2019s a love story, baby just say yes.\u201d\n\nAnd in \u201cCall It What You Want,\u201d Swift appears to reference those lyrics: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to save me \u2026 But would you run away with me? \u2026 Yes.\u201d\n\nThe entertainer also seems to reference her song \u201cClean\u201d off 1989, in which she sings \u201cWhen the flowers that we\u2019d grown together died of thirst.\u201d\n\nIn \u201cCall,\u201d Swift sings \u201cAll the flowers grew back as thorns / Windows boarded up after the storm / He built a fire just to keep me warm.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall It What You Want\u201d marks the third love song Swift has released off Reputation. \u201c\u2026Ready for It\u201d and \u201cGorgeous\u201d are both reportedly about her relationship with boyfriend Joe Alwyn, whom she\u2019s been quietly dating for a year.\n\nNovember is going to be a busy month for the singer, whose performance of a new song from Reputation will air during ABC\u2019s TGIT block on Nov. 9.\n\nRELATED VIDEO:

performance will mark her first public appearance since her new album \u2014 out Nov. 10 \u2014 was announced.", "images":
