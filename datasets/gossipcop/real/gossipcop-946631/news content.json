News: \"Gigi and Zayn are in a much better place since splitting.\n\n\"They needed the space apart for a bit and are now are giving things a second chance. They are very happy together and everyone around them can see it.\"\n\nGigi's mother Yolanda is said to be supportive of the pair giving things another go as she \"adores\" the 25-year-old hunk.\n\nThey continued: \"Gigi and Zayn have been spending a lot of time on Zayn's farm in Pennsylvania alongside Yolanda's.\n\n\"Zayn loves being in the rural area because he can clear his head. He has been through a lot and they both agreed being in Pennsylvania is the best way to find peace and happiness.\n\n\"Yolanda adores Zayn and is happy that the two could work things out.\"\n\nIn an interview with GQ magazine published last week, Zayn admitted he doesn't want to put a \"label\" on their relationship.\n\nHe said: \"I'm really thankful that I met her ... We're adults. We don't need to put a label on it, make it something for people's expectations. I had a very negative outlook on things [while recording my first solo album]. That might have been adolescence or testosterone or whatever the f**k was running through my body at the time. She's helped me to look at things from a positive angle.\"\n\nThe pair first fuelled speculation they had rekindled their romance after they were spotted kissing on the streets in New York City in May.", "images": ["https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/bcae21707a60631616dc262ed224e9d06264448c=w700", "https://www.iol.co.za/_next/static/media/iol.2d0c9660.svg", "https://www.iol.co.za/_next/static/media/iol.f8693d09.svg", "https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/bcae21707a60631616dc262ed224e9d06264448c/1000/jpeg"], "top_img": "https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/bcae21707a60631616dc262ed224e9d06264448c/1000/jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://iol.co.za/entertainment/celebrity-news/international/2018-06-24-gigi-hadid-and-zayn-malik-in-a-much-better-place/", "title": "Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik 'in a much better place'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Gigi's mother Yolanda is said to be supportive of the pair giving things another go as she \"adores\" the 25-year-old hunk.", "article": {"publisher": "https://iol.co.za", "published_time": 1529847000000, "author": "Bang Showbiz", "section": "Entertainment"}, "IE=edge": "X-UA-Compatible", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "4BE9A236252D15311B31D1EA103EE632", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=479535200", "fb": {"app_id": 293175074032541}, "google-site-verification": "iQCzO2whcLNU6_F3xi1Dck7JMALz7869mBLTQf08wJo", "facebook-domain-verification": "m85xaz5xdy8fiifyys11g0z5i7e2b0", "og": {"title": "Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik 'in a much better place'", "description": "Gigi's mother Yolanda is said to be supportive of the pair giving things another go as she \"adores\" the 25-year-old hunk.", "url": "https://iol.co.za/entertainment/celebrity-news/international/2018-06-24-gigi-hadid-and-zayn-malik-in-a-much-better-place/", "site_name": "IOL", "locale": "en-ZA", "image": {"identifier": "https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/bcae21707a60631616dc262ed224e9d06264448c/1000/jpeg", "width": 1000}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IOL", "creator": "@IOL", "title": "Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik 'in a much better place'", "description": "Gigi's mother Yolanda is said to be supportive of the pair giving things another go as she \"adores\" the 25-year-old hunk.", "image": {"identifier": "https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/bcae21707a60631616dc262ed224e9d06264448c/1000/jpeg", "width": 1000}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.iol.co.za", "summary": ""}
