The episode's director has since defended the cameo, saying the Glastonbury headliner did a 'lovely job'.\n\nCo-showrunner David Benioff previously explained: \"We knew that Maisie [Williams] was a big fan of Ed Sheeran, and for years we've been trying to get him on the show so we can surprise Maisie. This year we finally did it.\"\n\nIt was recently revealed that Sheeran will next make a cameo in The Simpsons, as a character caught up in a love triangle with Lisa Simpson.\n\nGame of Thrones season 7 continues on HBO, Sky Atlantic and NOWTV next Sunday.", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/18/09/ed-sheeran-1010629.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/18/09/ed-sheeran-1010629.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/ed-sheeran-twitter-delete-account-game-thrones-cameo-backlash-loop-glastonbury-arya-stark-a7846421.html", "title": "Ed Sheeran deletes Twitter account after Game of Thrones backlash", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/music/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "Show was criticised for putting the singer-songwriter in plain sight", "og": {"updated_time": "2017-07-19T09:12:33.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Ed Sheeran has deleted his Twitter account", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/news/ed-sheeran-twitter-delete-account-game-thrones-cameo-backlash-loop-glastonbury-arya-stark-a7846421.html", "type": "article", "description": "Show was criticised for putting the singer-songwriter in plain sight", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/18/09/ed-sheeran-1010629.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/18/09/ed-sheeran-1010629.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-19T09:12:33.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-07-19T09:12:33.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Music", "author_name": "Roisin O'Connor", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 454, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 6, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 0, "external_link_count": 6}, "date": "2017-07-19T09:12:33.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Ed Sheeran has deleted his Twitter account", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Show was criticised for putting the singer-songwriter in plain sight", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/18/09/ed-sheeran-1010629.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Ed Sheeran\",\"Game of Thrones\",\"David Benioff\",\"Maisie Williams\",\"Twitter\",\"Social Media\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500455553.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
