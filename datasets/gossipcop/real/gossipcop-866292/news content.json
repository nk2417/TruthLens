But considering the heat wave Los Angeles is currently experiencing, the chill was very refreshing. (See step by step photos below.)\n\nBefore taking the plunge (literally) I was, thankfully, armed with a plastic poncho that at least saved my hair from looking like a demented green Joker rip off. Daring participants are then told to stand under three huge chutes, while in our case, volunteers on the deck above rode exercise bikes that then activated the slime machine (the actual mechanics behind this are still a mystery to me).\n\nWe were warned that, above all, not to look up (slime apparently doesn\u2019t taste very good) and not to move afterward \u2014 as the plastic-covered floor is as slick as after a Patrick Bateman \u201cAmerican Psycho\u201d rampage.\n\nAnd then WHOOSH \u2014 the wave of slime that millions of kids across America dream of being drenched in came flooding down like a green tsunami over our heads, before slowing down to a steady drip like a giant leaky faucet.\n\nSimilar to a roller coaster ride, the buildup to a sliming is far worse than the actual experience, and the exhilaration afterwards lasts far longer.\n\nBut of course, you have green sticky remnants in your shoes, clothes, hair and other orifices for days to come as a reminder of the epic experience.\n\nEarlier (before being nearly drowned in green gunk by his crew), TheWrap spoke with Jay Schmalholz, SVP of unscripted development and live events at Nickelodeon, about what viewers can expect from the star-filled show, which features Julian Edelman, Von Miller, Michael Strahan and many others this year.\n\nSee highlights from our pre-sliming chat below.\n\nTheWrap: Why is Russell Wilson the perfect three-peat host?\n\nJay Schmalholz: It\u2019s a no-brainer. He is so likeable, he is really good at it, kids love him and he\u2019s like a big kid himself. He supports anything with kids in sports and he\u2019s really just so playful. From a Nickelodeon perspective, that is what we\u2019re looking for. Russell also treats it like a football game and reads the playbook so is always super prepared.\n\nWhat new surprises should we expect this year? What big stunts or challenges are you most excited about?\n\nEvery year we try to go bigger and blow kids\u2019 minds. This year, we have Slime Mountain, which is a giant ramp that goes into a pool of slime. Athletes have to climb it, break the codes and then they come down a water park-worthy slide that\u2019s 80 feet long and 45 feet high.\n\nHow does the show attract such a high level of stars each year?\n\nOur audience has a huge appetite for sports. The athletes like coming because they get to be big kids, be playful and bring their families. Nickelodeon has great relationships with the leagues and many of today\u2019 biggest sports stars grew up with the brand. We do it in such a special, unique way that it\u2019s not an ordinary awards show.\n\nAside from being such fun entertainment, why is it important to encourage kids to be sports fans and have such good role models?\n\nThat is one of the reasons we do the shows. Kids love sports stars and they\u2019re great role models. Their acceptance speeches are so genuine \u2014 they really encourage the kids to follow their dreams and to keep playing sports.\n\nWhat is the secret to making slime?\n\nIt is a special(secret) mixture that we make specifically for the network. It is sticky, wet, fun and is always a celebration. It\u2019s our own special sauce!\n\nWhat\u2019s the best way to survive a sliming?\n\nI always tell the athletes \u2014 including Kobe Bryant, Derek Jeter and David Beckham \u2014 that it is an honor to be slimed. You\u2019ve gotta take it with as much as excitement as you can. Embrace it, enjoy it and don\u2019t brace yourself too much. It\u2019s really fun experience and unlike any other.\n\nWho handled the sliming the best \u2014 or worst?\n\nEveryone handles it well, we\u2019ve slimed the biggest stars in the world, and they\u2019re all laughing backstage afterwards. It is a rite of passage and on everyone\u2019s bucket list.\n\n\u201cKids\u2019 Choice Sports 2017\u201d will be taped live on Thursday, July 13, from UCLA\u2019s Pauley Pavilion in Los Angeles, and air July 16 at 8 p.m. The show\u2019s sponsors include include Airheads, Crest, Nationwide\u2019s Make Safe Happen, Popsicle, Chrysler Pacifica, Capri Sun and Verizon.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/5x4_082025_COVER_B.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Getting-Slimed.jpg?resize=618%2C775&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Getting-Slimed-2.jpg?resize=618%2C718&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Slime-Test-5.jpg?resize=618%2C607&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Slime-Test-3.jpg?resize=618%2C783&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kobe-Bryant-Gold-Slime-Nickelodeon-Kids-Choice-Sports.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kobe-Bryant-Gold-Slime-Nickelodeon-Kids-Choice-Sports.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Debbie Emery", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid", "Border-Radius Box-Shadow Rgba", "Rgba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/inside-the-nickelodeon-kids-choice-sports-awards-slime-test-photos/", "title": "Inside the Nickelodeon \u2018Kids\u2019 Choice Sports Awards Slime Test (Photos)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Inside the Nickelodeon 'Kids' Choice Sports Awards Slime Test (Photos)", "description": "TheWrap gets slimmed ahead of Thursday's sticky awards show -- and it's really messy", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/inside-the-nickelodeon-kids-choice-sports-awards-slime-test-photos/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Kobe-Bryant-Gold-Slime-Nickelodeon-Kids-Choice-Sports.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2017-07-13T19:55:44+00:00"}, "author": "Debbie Emery", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@debemery", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Debbie Emery", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "5 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "david_beckham, derek_jeter, julian-edelman, kobe_bryant, michael_strahan, nickelodeon-kids-choice-sports-awards, rob-gronkowski, russell-wilson, verizon", "article-section": "news", "article-categories": "awards, news, sports-category-column, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499975744.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
