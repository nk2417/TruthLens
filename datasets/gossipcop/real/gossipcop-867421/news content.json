{"url": "https://www.thewrap.com/bachelorette-rachel-lindsay-ratings-millennials/", "text": "Forget lame suitors like Lucas, it is millennials who are truly failing \u201cBachelorette\u201d Rachel Lindsay.\n\nIn the 18-34 demographic\u2019s TV ratings, \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d is down 24 percent year over year, with a 1.9 versus last summer\u2019s 2.5. Among men of that age range, the decline is an even 25 percent, with women clocking in at minus 22 percent.\n\nThat means those born between 1983 and 1999 are departing the ABC series more than any other age range, right as we finally got our first African-American \u201cBachelorette.\u201d So much for our most progressive generation.\n\nElsewhere, Lindsay\u2019s season is currently down 15 percent from last year in the advertiser-coveted 18-49 demographic, with a 2.2 average against its 2.6 benchmark.\n\nTypically a hit summer series by any measure, this \u201cBachelorette\u201d is attracting 12 percent fewer total viewers versus Summer 2016, with Nielsen tallying 7.143 million overall eyeballs per episode, down from the prior run\u2019s 8.108 million average. None of those are good, but the declines appear modest next to the millennial runoff.\n\nAt least there are currently no other issues impacting the future of the \u201cBachelor\u201d universe. Oh, wait.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tony-Maglio.png?fit=53%2C58&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tony-Maglio.png?resize=150%2C150&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/5x4_082025_COVER_B.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BacheloretteRachelLindsay.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BacheloretteRachelLindsay.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tony Maglio", "Tv Editor", "Tony.Maglio Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/bachelorette-rachel-lindsay-ratings-millennials/", "title": "\u2018The Bachelorette\u2019: Millennials Are Fleeing Rachel Lindsay\u2019s Season", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'The Bachelorette': Millennials Are Fleeing Rachel Lindsay's Season", "description": "Nearly one-quarter of adults 18-34 have ditched ABC dating show's season with first African-American bachelorette", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/bachelorette-rachel-lindsay-ratings-millennials/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/BacheloretteRachelLindsay.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2017-06-28T21:29:09+00:00"}, "author": "Tony Maglio", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Tony Maglio", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "abc, bachelorette, rachel-lindsay, the_bachelorette, tv_ratings", "article-section": "news", "article-categories": "news, ratings, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498685349.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
