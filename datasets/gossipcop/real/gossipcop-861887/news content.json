Alyssa Milano became a household name in the 1980s with her starring role on the sitcom \"Who's the Boss?\". She appeared in several television movies in the 1990s. She starred in the television series \"Charmed.\" Other notable roles of hers include the short-lived sitcom \"Romantically Challenged\" and the film \"Hall Pass.\"\n\nFinancial Lawsuit\n\nIn 2017, Milano sued a former business manager who reportedly left her millions of dollars in debt and ruined her credit. She hired the management company in 2006 and terminated the relationship in 2016 \"after discovering that although paid handsomely, they did not competently perform any of the duties for which they were engaged or behaved in an honest, forthright and truthful manner,\" per the lawsuit.\n\nFurthermore, Milano alleged that the management company allowed the costs of a home renovation to soar to $5 million. After the renovations, the home was worth $3 million. Milano was under the impression her finances were perfectly fine and turned down lucrative acting roles, but in reality, she and her husband were millions of dollars in debt. Her manager reportedly failed to make payments to the IRS in 2013 and 2014, which led to millions of dollars in penalties and unpaid taxes. She further alleged that the manager forged her name to make bad investments in things like a parking lot. In the wake of the financial problems, Milano apparently put her West Hollywood condo up for sale. She and the business manager settled out of court on undisclosed terms in June 2019.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn October 2005, Alyssa paid $975,000 for a condo in West Hollywood, California. As we mentioned a moment ago, Alyssa listed the home for sale in the wake of having financial problems. She was at one time seeking $2 million. In 2001, Alyssa paid $1.6 million for a 7,700-square-foot home in Bell Canyon, California.\n\nEarly Life\n\nAlyssa Jayne Milano was born on December 19, 1972, in Brooklyn, New York City. Her parents are Lin Milano, a fashion designer and talent manager, and Thomas M. Milano, a film-music editor. Their family is of Italian descent, and she was raised Roman Catholic. Milano has a younger brother, Cory, who is younger than her by a decade.\n\nCareer Beginnings\n\nWhen Milano was seven years old, her babysitter took her to an audition for a national touring company of \"Annie.\" This happened without Milano's parents' permission. Milano made it through the auditions and was actually chosen for one of the four principal parts, beating out more than 1,500 other girls. While she was in the play, Milano and her mother traveled the United States with the touring company and were on the road for 18 months. Upon their return to New York, Milano began appearing in various television commercials, and also in different off-Broadway stage productions.\n\nCareer\n\nIn August 1984, when she was 11 years old, Milano made her film debut in the drama \"Old Enough.\" The film won First Prize at the Sundance Film Festival. She then landed the role of the daughter of Tony Danza's character on the sitcom \"Who's the Boss?\" and the show began airing on ABC in September 1984. To support her career, her whole family actually moved out to Los Angeles that year, where the show was filmed and produced. She starred on the show for eight seasons, until its end in 1992, for a total of 196 episodes. This role established her as a household name and teen idol and opened up the opportunity for her to take on many more roles. For example, when she was 12 years old, she co-starred with Arnold Schwarzenegger in \"Commando\" (1985). On stage, she starred in productions like \"Tender Offer\" by Wendy Wasserstein, \"All Night Long\" by John O'Keefe, and \"Butterflies Are Free\" in Los Angeles (December 1991 \u2013 January 1992).\n\nAfter a Japanese producer saw her perform, Milano was offered a five-album record deal. She ended up only releasing four studio albums: \"Look in My Heart\" (1989), \"Alyssa\" (1989), \"Locked Inside a Dream\" (1991), and \"Do You See Me?\" (1992). The general sound of the albums is described by Milano herself as \"bubblegum pop,\" and she has been openly critical of their musical quality. Her musical career actually did not fare too badly overseas; she achieved platinum status in Japan. However, she did not pursue a music career back in the United States, saying that she would \"much rather have [her music] released where it's appreciated than laughed at. \" She continued to work on various projects, including producing a teen workout video, \"Teen Steam,\" as well as starring in things like the television films \"Crash Course\" (1988) and \"Dance til' Dawn\" (1988) and the independent film \"Where the Day Takes You\" (1992). In an attempt to distance herself from the \"nice girl\" image established by her work on \"Who's the Boss?\", Milano appeared in a number of erotic films like \"Embrace of the Vampire\" (1995) and \"Deadly Sins\" (1995). In these films, she appeared in several nude scenes.\n\nFrom 1995 to 1998, Milano starred in seasons 5-7 of \"Melrose Place\" as the character Jennifer Mancini. After leaving \"Melrose Place,\" she joined the cast of \"Charmed\" as the character Phoebe Halliwell. The show ran for eight seasons until 2006. In addition to starring in \"Charmed,\" Milano also became a producer on the show beginning with the fifth season. She has gone on to appear on shows like \"Mistresses\" (2013-2014) and \"Insatiable\" (2018-2019). On top of her television work, Milano has also appeared in films like \"My Girlfriend's Boyfriend\" (2010) and \"Hall Pass\" (2011).\n\nSalary\n\nAt the peak of her time on \"Charmed,\" Alyssa earned $90,000 per episode, which worked out to around $2 million per season.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nFrom 1987 to 1990, Milano was in a relationship with the actor Corey Haim, who struggled with addiction throughout their relationship. Supposedly, Milano and his manager tried unsuccessfully to get him professional help. In 1993, she became engaged to fellow actor Scott Wolf. However, they ended their engagement and separated just a year later. She revealed in 2019 that, despite being on birth control at the time, she had actually gotten pregnant with Wolf and undergone two abortions in 1993 while they were still together. In 2008, Milano became engaged to David Bugliari, an agent at Creative Artists Agency, after a year of dating. They got married at Bugliari's family home in August 2009. Together, they have two children: a son born in August 2011 and a daughter born in September 2014.", "images": ["https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/1JoH3482haSLevnlEMdqhrz36y0=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/11/George-Clooney.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/I4dSiTJhq0kprSuO--deoPCEAmQ=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/06/taylor.png", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/uRsxoLs7Ymmit5ATgRtN2utad40=/221x5:381x236/132x132/filters:format(webp):strip_exif()/2009/09/P-Diddy.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/70u2GbaJUB7buVfDlDLYp_mqy90=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2012/11/GettyImages-467311706.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/alyssa.jpg?x46379", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/themes/cnw_2023/svg/logo.svg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/e4HIkMX5HrAgXF4l_wZSlOFucdo=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2021/07/Corey-Haim.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/tDVIVJWr4kN6dN2370ck_0khUtA=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/12/Shannen-Doherty.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/_hOmdPz8Ht24ZxIeZM7m4mGRouk=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/11/GettyImages-1094653148.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/yboGsO77E1kQwELLmrwRZv_4RmE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2017/02/GettyImages-528215436.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/lt1abKKVHSBtY-US0k9GLU9MTmM=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/09/Brad-Pitt.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/IoWqGPmFDjvC6iTqcDsspXBuxqo=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2018/03/GettyImages-821622848.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/dXuAPIEBU--L_kRib4u0nSzjUtE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/04/Megan-Fox.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/oMb0osaGQtktrsZ-3EzTNZyqxJQ=/600x300/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/06/alyssa.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/iJEE8xMURZAIef3-XSEPsqOdwxQ=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2010/03/Corey-Feldman-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/lY3-oCS-xIdiqDaOi1qHd6UaTjg=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/09/Cristiano-Ronaldo.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/GQQ2elsxoEcqDC6VhD1h094tADg=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2023/07/Holly-Marie-Combs-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/95i5RI1LWkjHyyoolMeto-z_WeU=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/01/lopez3.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/KFAqJ9F4o80l6an2fe78-0jw28s=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/04/rr.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript"], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/alyssa.jpg?x46379", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/alyssa-milano-net-worth/", "title": "Alyssa Milano Net Worth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Alyssa Milano is an American actress, producer and singer who has a net worth of $4 million.
