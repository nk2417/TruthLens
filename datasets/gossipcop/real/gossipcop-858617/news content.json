He couldn\u2019t get through to her on the phone.\n\n\u201cI wanted to know where she was and whether she was ok and then there were all these other people badly injured too,\u201d Buckley tells PEOPLE.\n\nDanny Lawson/PA Images/INSTAR\n\nDanny Lawson/PA Images/INSTAR\n\nHe eventually found Stephanie in a nearby hotel and was reunited in the early hours of the Tuesday morning. She was okay, despite suffering some crush injuries and a concussion.\n\n\u201cShe ran to me but I couldn\u2019t hold her because I was covered in blood. I told her I have got other peoples\u2019 blood all over me, \u201d the police constable said.\n\nTwenty-two people died and more than 100 were injured when a device carried by Salman Abedi, 22, was detonated just as the first concertgoers were leaving the Manchester Arena.\n\nThe prince was following his grandmother Queen Elizabeth\u2019s lead, as she made a visit to the city last Thursday, just days after the attack. During her heartwarming visit, she chatted with young victims in their hospital beds, condemning the barbaric act as \u201cvery wicked.\u201d\n\nAmidst the terror of not being able to find his daughter, Buckley and other police officers first on the scene went from victim to victim, treating injuries.\n\n\u201cThere was one lady who died three times and we got her back three times and then we lost her the fourth time. It was very difficult,\u201d he said.\n\nKensington Palace/Twitter\n\nKensington Palace/Twitter\n\nAlongside him was Chris Jenkins, a police community support officer, who said he was among the first there because he lives five minutes away from Manchester Arena.\n\nHe heard the blast, looked out of his window and saw the aftermath. He ran straight out to help.\n\n\u201cIt was just absolute chaos with people running and screaming in different directions. I was just trying to feed back to comms what I was seeing and hearing. At the time you don\u2019t know the bigger picture,\u201d he said.\n\nThe police officers said that William asked them whether they were also getting all the help they needed to support for their own welfare, too.\n\nJenkins told PEOPLE, \u201cHe was showing his respect and gratitude for what we did.\u201d\n\nWilliam also met Lisa Canovan, an emergency dispatcher who took one of the first calls.\n\nDanny Lawson/PA Images/INSTAR\n\nDanny Lawson/PA Images/INSTAR\n\nKensington Palace/Twitter\n\n\u201cHe was asking about when the call came in and what it was like in the room. In the beginning, we were kind of hoping it was a hoax,\u201d she said.\n\nThe operation room took 89 emergency calls in the first 15 minutes. They had been expecting around 17. Canovan, 37, who has only been in the job for six months and said William, \u201cwas asking about the support she was receiving too.\u201d\n\nWilliam also met some of the first detectives in the scene and a police officer who responded from the street to dash to the scene.\n\nChelsea Meaney, 26, a response officer, has only been in her post for 18 weeks.\n\n\u201cIt was not what I was expecting,\u201d she said of the first response to the bombing. \u201cI had been told there were four injured people upstairs. It was a bit of a shock to the system but we didn\u2019t have much to think about it, we just had to help.\u201d\n\nAt his second stop he met first responders and members of the local community who provided vital care and support to those affected by the attack, including representatives from St. John\u2019s Ambulance, Northern Rail and the British Red Cross.", "images":
