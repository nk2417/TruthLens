Now, you can just drink it out of a forty.\n\nThe container famous for malt liquor and cheap beer will now house the wine of summer. Imagine those games of \"Edward Fortyhands.\"\n\nRos\u00e9 is having a bit of a kale moment right now as it enters the realm of millennial popularity along with unicorn food and poke.\n\nBetween ros\u00e9 magnums, the rise of \"bros\u00e9\", and even ros\u00e9 Jell-O shots, it's clear that blush fever is in full effect.\n\n\n\nRELATED: 5 things every wine lover needs\n\nThe 40-ounce bottle is cost effective. Most people spend around $15 to $20 for a traditional bottle of ros\u00e9 and those bottles only hold 750 milliliters, or about 25 ounces of wine. Since a forty holds nearly twice that amount, they end up being quite a deal. These have been selling for just $16.\n\nJust because it's cost effective doesn't mean it can't be fancy or at least French. Forty Ounce Wines, which also makes a muscadet, is produced in the Loire Valley by French winemaker Julien Braud.\n\nRELATED: Wine-infused coffee is finally here\n\nWant to purchase the ros\u00e9 forty? You're going to have to plan a road trip!\n\nThey're for sale in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, California, and Colorado.\n\nYou'll have to move fast. Due to a difficult season in the Loire Valley, the company only produced 1,200 cases from the 2016 vintage so they probably won't last long.", "images": ["https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18183231_112025-wls-cate-cta-attack-10p-vid.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.net/abcotv/assets/news/global/images/feature-header/wls-sm.svg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18182271_112025-wls-eric-ramming-charges-5p-vid.jpg", "https://assets-cdn.abcotvs.net/static/images/devices/android-white.svg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/1864216_40OZ ROSE-VO WIPE_13TV51CJ_1_00-00-37,26.jpg?w=1600", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18182367_112025-wls-i94-closed-6p-vo-vid.jpg", "data:image/svg;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAQAAACRI2S5AAAAEElEQVR42mNkIAAYRxWAAQAG9gAKqv6+AwAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==", "https://assets-cdn.abcotvs.net/static/images/WLS_white.svg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.net/abcotv/assets/news/global/images/feature-header/wls-lg.svg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18181910_112025-wls-kawash-ice-arrests-4p-vid.jpg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/18183333_112025-wls-chatman-travel-agency-thumb-img.jpg", "https://assets-cdn.abcotvs.net/static/images/devices/ios-white.svg", "https://cdn.abcotvs.net/abcotv/static/common/origins/origin-ktrk.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.abcotvs.com/dip/images/1864216_40OZ ROSE-VO WIPE_13TV51CJ_1_00-00-37,26.jpg?w=1600", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://abc7chicago.com/post/rose-now-comes-in-40-ounce-bottles/1864548/", "title": "Wine lovers, rejoice!
