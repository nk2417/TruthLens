Music will ALWAYS be what transcends us and myself. The studio has always been my safe haven. But the ultimate goal for me is to be satisfied. I never want to be a figure of disappointment.\"\n\nA Tampa, Florida, native, he ends the letter with a quote from singer Boy George, who also has been open in discussing his sexuality.\n\n\"The best quote to sum 'I've never felt as though I didn't belong, I just acted as though I did.' \u2014 Boy George\"\n\nCarter's tweet follows his July 15 arrest in Georgia on suspicion of driving under the influence and marijuana possession. His girlfriend, Madison Parker, was in the passenger seat of the car and was also taken into police custody.
