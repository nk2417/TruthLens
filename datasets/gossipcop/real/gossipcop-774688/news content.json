Like Stassi just bought a bikini for $200 would she pay that or would Bravo foot the bill as the purchase and shopping trip was for filming?\n\n-Holidays/Trips? I noticed certain housewives being the host or inviting other housewives but who actually pays for the holiday itself?", "images": ["https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2v6dk/styles/bannerBackgroundImage_txoxgh5u539c1.jpg?format=pjpg&s=f78d1ac571b35c1cc464d03367ba034474fa663a", "https://id.rlcdn.com/472486.gif", "https://www.redditstatic.com/shreddit/assets/favicon/64x64.png", "https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2v6dk/styles/communityIcon_t5hgvbknv9cd1.png?width=96&height=96&frame=1&auto=webp&crop=96%3A96%2Csmart&s=9eaddbbfdf8d0317a73a2834bd2f3c0336e23cb4"], "top_img": "https://www.redditstatic.com/shreddit/assets/favicon/64x64.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "The heart of the internet", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#000000", "theme-color": "#000000"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.reddit.com", "summary": ""}
