Naturally, the conversation turned to President Trump \u2014 whom Baldwin hopes doesn\u2019t get to serve a second term.\n\nBaldwin \u2014 whose portrayal of Trump on Saturday Night Live has drawn Twitter criticism from the president himself but has earned the actor an Emmy \u2014 told Stern, \u201cI can only think of a couple people who I think could beat Trump.\u201d When Stern suggested that Baldwin should run for the Oval Office in 2020, the actor confidently replied, \u201cIf I ran, I would win. I would absolutely win. I 1,000 percent would win.\u201d\n\nHowever, Baldwin said an official bid is highly unlikely because of his hosting duties on ABC\u2019s Match Game revival. Plus, his wife, Hilaria Baldwin, \u201cwould kill\u201d him. \u201cI\u2019ve got to do Match Game! The presidency of the United States or Match Game?\u201d he jokingly asked Stern. \u201cYou tell me.\u201d\n\nBaldwin then slipped into his caricature of Trump and revealed his plans to take the summer off should he ever be elected. \u201cI\u2019m gonna take the summer off and be like, \u2018Listen everybody, I\u2019m going to East Hampton to relax. Howard and I have to go to Nick & Toni\u2019s,'\u201d he said, garnering laughter from Stern.\n\nWhen Stern brought up the idea of Baldwin running for president as Trump, the 30 Rock alum doubled down on his prior statement: \u201cIf I ran for president, I would win! Hands down, I would win. It would be the funniest, most exciting, most crazy campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re the hope of the Democratic Party,\u201d Stern said, to which Baldwin quickly replied, \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated: \u201cThe only reason I say that is because I\u2019d love to run for that position to just have things be very common sense. There\u2019s so many things that this country needs to do that are so obvious.\u201d\n\nDuring his chat with Stern, Baldwin emphasized that he\u2019d like to \u201csee a healthy\u201d Republican Party. \u201cI don\u2019t want [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi to run everything either,\u201d Baldwin said of the California Democrat. \u201cI want the Democrats to have a smart opposition to keep them on their toes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to see the Republican Party get back to [John McCain or Mitt Romney],\u201d he explained to Stern. \u201cI\u2019d like to think that this thing with Trump is a one-off.\u201d\n\nStill, Baldwin believes Trump\u2019s election has had a negative impact on the way Americans view potential candidates. \u201cWe buy the presidency now \u2014 we vote for the president \u2014 like we buy gum or laundry soap,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all jingoism and all this marketing.\u201d\n\nBaldwin also offered a \u201ctheory\u201d about Trump\u2019s history-making summit in Singapore with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un. \u201cYou can almost see Trump\u2019s people saying to Kim Jong Un\u2019s people, \u2018We don\u2019t really care if you get rid of the nukes. Let\u2019s just say you are,'\u201d Baldwin said, slipping into his impression of Trump again. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s politics. Let me go home and say what I need to say to get reelected.'\u201d\n\nBaldwin has hinted that he might be done playing Trump on SNL. In a recent interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he said of the gig, \u201cEvery time I do it now, it\u2019s like agony. Agony.\u201d\n\nWatch part of Baldwin\u2019s interview with Stern above.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/4bdc97bf-a2ae-4ca8-9828-ea5b1b39cab4.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/4bdc97bf-a2ae-4ca8-9828-ea5b1b39cab4.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evan Real", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/alec-baldwin-trump-winning-presidential-election-1119319/", "title": "Alec Baldwin on Running for President: \u201cI Would Win\u201d", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Alec Baldwin is confident he could beat Donald Trump if he were to run against the president in 2020.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Evan Real", "tags": "Alec Baldwin, donald trump, howard stern", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Alec Baldwin on Running for President: \u201cI Would Win\u201d", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/politics-news/alec-baldwin-trump-winning-presidential-election-1119319/", "description": "Alec Baldwin is confident he could beat Donald Trump if he were to run against the president in 2020.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/4bdc97bf-a2ae-4ca8-9828-ea5b1b39cab4.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "Alec Baldwin on Trump, Winning Presidential Election"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-12T07:46:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-12T08:14:04+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Alec Baldwin is confident he could beat Donald Trump if he were to run against the president in 2020.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Alec Baldwin on Running for President: \u201cI Would Win\u201d", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/4bdc97bf-a2ae-4ca8-9828-ea5b1b39cab4.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528789578.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
