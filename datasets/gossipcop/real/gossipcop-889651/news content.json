The piece, written by a female reporter who interviewed Toback at the Venice Film Festival, was titled \u201cJames Toback Gets Us, He Truly Gets Us in \u2018The Private Life of a Modern Woman.\u2019\u201d\n\nBlair tweeted the story with a single word in response: \u201cIronic.\u201d\n\nIn the days that followed, Blair, who has appeared in films such as Cruel Intentions, Legally Blonde, and Hellboy, learned about a group of women on social media who claimed to have been sexually harassed by the director (Two Girls and a Guy) and Oscar-nominated writer (Bugsy). Their accounts sounded eerily familiar. The group, which included Blair, worked with Los Angeles Times reporter Glenn Whipp on a story that broke on October 22, citing 38 women in total who alleged sexual harassment suffered at the hands of Toback. Since then, the number of accusers has risen to more than 200 women\u2014including Blair and Oscar-nominated actress Rachel McAdams, who both spoke exclusively to Vanity Fair this week about their experiences with Toback. (Toback, 72, has written for Vanity Fair in the past. When reached by phone Wednesday evening, Toback said he had no comment on any of the allegations.)\n\nBlair, 45, and McAdams, 38, tell remarkably similar stories about Toback\u2019s modus operandi\u2014the requests to meet him in hotel rooms, flattery about their acting skills, the promise of a role in the movie Harvard Man, which opened in 2001. The consistent themes in the stories of Blair, McAdams, and the hundreds of actresses who have come forward with their own tales of harassment hint at some of the reasons charges of sexual misconduct have plagued Hollywood since its inception. Actors and actresses, newcomers especially, essentially are always auditioning\u2014any encounter, especially in a company town such as Los Angeles, could lead to a big break. The situation is compounded by the fact that many acting courses teach students to use, explore, and expose their vulnerabilities. So when a threatening individual manipulates a performer\u2019s insecurities in a meeting purportedly related to an acting role, the experience can be confusing.\n\nExplained McAdams, \u201cI was 21 and in the middle of theater school when I met [Toback]. Theater school was a very safe space.\u201d But Toback, she said, \u201cused the same language during my audition\u2014that you have to take risks and sometimes you\u2019re going to be uncomfortable and sometimes it\u2019s going to feel dangerous. And that\u2019s a good thing\u2014when there is danger in the air and you feel like you are out of your comfort zone.\u201d\n\nIt is easy to see how a young actress at the start of her career might respond to a director\u2019s lecherous behavior as an acting exercise or \u201ctest.\u201d In an opinion piece in The New York Times that detailed an incident with Harvey Weinstein, Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong\u2019o noted that \u201cbody work\u201d is part of the coursework at fine-arts programs at schools such as Yale. Perhaps Weinstein knew this when he reportedly asked to massage and be massaged by women. Perhaps Toback knew this when he allegedly asked young women, after rattling off his film credits and famous friends, to trust him and disrobe so that he could help them become better actresses.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6904b792447a00332ceb4fd3/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6901590b82f816fa8547858d/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fbde150b3b961d91154947/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690b9ba3d0d7aa0f3c9fb7e4/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f21d3b8f85857e9bf60831/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/l-Selma-Blair-Interview.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690ba491d862d6f327955a8e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690ba383ec5ef29213749186/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f2219fa923ff0fd178caa2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-selma-blair-rachel-mcadams.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69121562183bbbb5eb312f87/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690910a959c3a0008231faac/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59dec8d5034e986d4cd31532/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/All-the-women-who-have-accused-Harvey-Weinstein.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f21a0320586235aaecf906/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Embed-Rachel-McAdams.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59ef7eb6556f5850638b4765/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/James-Toback-Sexual-Assault-Accusations.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690ba04e625f5a8c4860326f/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fb86a1172e030be4533183/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f2219fa923ff0fd178caa2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-selma-blair-rachel-mcadams.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Krista Smith With Julie Miller"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/10/selma-blair-and-rachel-mcadams-share-their-stories-of-james-toback-sexual-harassment", "title": "Selma Blair and Rachel McAdams Share Their Stories of James Toback\u2019s Sexual Harassment", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Krista Smith with Julie Miller", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Both women encountered the director early in their careers.
