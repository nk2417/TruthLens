That includes the biggest opening for a horror movie, the largest opening for a September movie, and the highest grossing horror film ever.\n\nThe King novel was always meant to be adapted into two parts, with the first movie focusing on the children\u2019s experience with the iconic monster and the follow-up to be told from the adults\u2019 perspective.\n\n\u201cIt\u201d starred Bill Skarsgard, Finn Wolfhard, Jaeden Lieberher, Wyatt Oleff and Chosen Jacobs, and was directed by Andy Muschietti. The film was released on Sept. 8 and received solid reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a score of 84 percent \u201cfresh.\u201d\n\nUntil then, New Line will release \u201cLife of the Party\u201d in co-production with Warner Bros. starring Melissa McCarthy, Maya Rudolph and Gillian Jacobs. The studio will also release \u201cGame Night\u201d and \u201cThe Nun,\u201d the latest addition to the \u201cConjuring\u201d franchise.\n\nSo far, nothing else is dated on Sept. 6, 2019.
