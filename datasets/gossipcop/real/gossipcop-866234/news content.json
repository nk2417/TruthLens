It wasn't even powder. \u201cSo we did go to Dylan\u2019s Candy Shop,\u201d Kim said, holding up the bag of goodies. \u201cI did think it was our pixie sticks, but after all that, this table in the background is a marble table. You guys, like, come on!\u201d\n\nShe added, \"I don\u2019t play like that, come on. I have kids. It\u2019s just not my lifestyle. I\u2019ve never been like that. I just really can\u2019t believe this.\u201d\n\nThe mother of two also made headlines on Monday night when she stepped out in New York City wearing only a bra, velvet leggings and a blazer.\n\n\n\nMORE: Khloe Kardashian Slams Those Hating on Her Workout Posts -- 'If Only Complaining Burned Calories'\n\n\n\nThis isn't the first time Kim has called somebody out. She recently threw shade at Caitlyn Jenner for the comments made about her mother, Kris Jenner, in the former Olympian's memoir, The Secrets of My Life. \"[Caitlyn is] promoting this book and she\u2019s saying all these things. And I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary. I just feel like it\u2019s unfair, things aren\u2019t truthful,\" Kim said while on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in April. \"I just feel like there\u2019s no need for a book. Tell your story, but just don\u2019t bash other people.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Kim Kardashian Tells 'Big Bully' Khloe to 'Shut the F**k Up' During Family Vacation\n\n\n\nOriginally published Tuesday, July 11, 2017 at 12:30 p.m. ET.
