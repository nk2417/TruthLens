Three of the dresses, designed by Stella McCartney for Claire Foy, Diane von Furstenburg for Madeline Brewer, and Rosie Assoulin for Mandy Moore, will be part of a sweepstakes for eBay users who donate $25 or more to the legal defense fund.\n\n\"At Cond\u00e9 Nast, we've always believed in the importance of swift action to support meaningful social change,\u201d said Cond\u00e9 Nast Artistic Director and Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour in the press release. \u201cThrough this auction powered by eBay for Charity, and harnessing the compelling pull of both fashion and activism, we're hopeful that the black dresses worn at this year's historic Golden Globe Awards will raise funds for the Time's Up initiative, and serve to support the stories and voices of those who have been victims of sexual misconduct.\"\n\nLaura Dern in Armani\n\nHere's the full list of designers and celebrities who are donating their looks:\n\nArmani \u2013 Laura Dern Balenciaga \u2013 Salma Hayek Pinault Brandon Maxwell -
