[The video contains offensive language and can be seen in full here.]\n\nLawley apologized on Monday night for his actions. \u201cWords have power and can do damage. I own mine and I am sorry. I respect Fox\u2019s decision to recast this role for \u2018The Hate U Give\u2019 as it is an important story, and it would not be appropriate for me to be involved considering the actions of my past. I understand the impact and I have grown and learned since then. From now on I plan to use my voice for positive change,\u201d Lawley said in a statement to Variety.\n\nHe first responded to the backlash Sunday on Twitter, writing, \u201cIf u don\u2019t learn from ur mistakes, u can never grow as a person. I\u2019ve learned a lot & I am grateful to have the power to change. I never want to be who I was yesterday. We\u2019re in a constant battle to become a better version of ourselves, use ur voice as ur weapon.\u201d\n\nif u don\u2019t learn from ur mistakes, u can never grow as a person. i\u2019ve learned a lot & i am grateful to have the power to change. i never want to be who i was yesterday. we\u2019re in a constant battle to become a better version of ourselves, use ur voice as ur weapon. \u2014 Kian Lawley (@KianLawley) February 4, 2018\n\nLawley was set to play the boyfriend of the film\u2019s star, Amandla Stenberg.
