He woke up looking for his daddy. We left our house in such a hurry Kroy had no shoes on and I literally was half naked w/ deep conditioner in my hair...Those were the least of our worries.\u201d\n\nIn the pic, Kroy is barefoot with protective covers on his feet as he walked beside Kash\u2019s hospital bed.\n\nKroy isn\u2019t the only one who has stayed by Kash\u2019s side. He\u2019s also been joined by his brother, KJ, who has spent the night in the hospital throughout the ordeal.\n\nKim shared another image of little KJ holding Kash\u2019s hand with the caption, \u201cFirst and fair most THANK YOU for all your prayers. They were heard and Kash is going home today earlier than expected. Thank you for all your comments, tweets, emails, and texts. We honestly felt all the positive energy you guys were sending and we couldn\u2019t be more grateful.
