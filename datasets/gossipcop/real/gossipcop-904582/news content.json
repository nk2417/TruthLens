Give me a minute. Give me a minute!\"\n\nHis wish was the Golden Globes' command because he got to continue his acceptance speech.\n\n\"For 25 years I have handcrafted very strange little tales made of motion, colour, light and shadow,\" he explained. \"In three precise instances, these strange stories, these fables, have saved my life. Once with Devil's Backbone, once with Pan's Labyrinth, and now with Shape of Water, because as directors, these things are not just entries in a filmography. We have made a deal with a particularly inefficient devil that trades three years of our lives for one entry on IMDb. And these things are biography and they are alive.\"\n\nThe Shape of Water stars Octavia Spencer, Michael Shannon, Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones.\n\nDel Toro was nominated alongside Martin McDonagh for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, Ridley Scott for All The Money In The World and Steven Spielberg for The Post.\n\nThe director's speech wasn't the only impassioned one of the night - Oprah Winfrey gave a memorable monologue for her acceptance of the Cecil B. DeMille award for excellent contributions to the entertainment industry.\n\nThis is Del Toro's first Golden Globe win.", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/08/05/guillermo-del-toro-golden-globes.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/08/05/guillermo-del-toro-golden-globes.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/guillermo-del-toro-golden-globes-refuse-leave-stage-music-speech-shape-of-water-a8147196.html", "title": "Guillermo Del Toro refuses to leave Golden Globes stage despite time being up: 'It's taken 25 years'", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "Film", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/films", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "He stood his ground", "og": {"updated_time": "2018-01-08T12:47:58.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "The Golden Globes tried to get Guillermo Del Toro off stage but he refused with a glorious response", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/guillermo-del-toro-golden-globes-refuse-leave-stage-music-speech-shape-of-water-a8147196.html", "type": "article", "description": "He stood his ground", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/08/05/guillermo-del-toro-golden-globes.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/08/05/guillermo-del-toro-golden-globes.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-08T12:47:58.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-08T12:47:58.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Film", "author_name": "Ilana Kaplan", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 334, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 2, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 1, "external_link_count": 0}, "date": "2018-01-08T12:47:58.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "The Golden Globes tried to get Guillermo Del Toro off stage but he refused with a glorious response", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "He stood his ground", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/08/05/guillermo-del-toro-golden-globes.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Golden Globes 2018\",\"Guillermo Del Toro\",\"The Shape of Water\",\"All the Money in the World\",\"Dunkirk\",\"Oprah Winfrey\",\"post\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515415678.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
