Meghan let out a simple \"Wow\" at her first site of the crowds. Harry, however, was little bit more cheeky: According to the Telegraph, who consulted with lip reader Tina Lannin, he said to his bride: \"I'm ready for a drink now.\" That seems more than reasonable.\n\nHis reception toast:\n\nWINDSOR, UNITED KINGDOM - MAY 19: Duchess of Sussex and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex wave as they leave Windsor Castle after their wedding to attend an evening reception at Frogmore House, hosted by the Prince of Wales on May 19, 2018 in Windsor, England.

According to a guest who attended the event and spoke to People, Harry delighted guests by calling Meghan \"my wife\" for the very first time.\n\n\u201cIt was very off-the-cuff, which was lovely,\u201d the guest revealed. \u201cHe promised that all the Americans wouldn\u2019t steal the swords and said, \u2018Please, when you leave, be quiet as you don\u2019t want to wake the neighbors,\u2019 which was quite fun.\u201d\n\nAs the guest also noted, the event was \u201cmore than you would ever imagine it to be. It did feel like we were really part of their very special occasion. It just felt about the two of them, which was great.\u201d\n\nThe fact that he invited his exes to the ceremony:", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/690fa8fe6354a28fc25e0fe8/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691b51c999e8794ba5a3ea3e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6903b5c553adbbd18445744c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690cb3dce15045443103b7f7/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/logo-oneNav.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691388f0185ff327272e0075/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68e7f043f314a34ac78dfaf9/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/69023fef168544cc53722b47/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68e34c5318bbba9289b1c2e5/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/glamour-banner-v2.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6762e655ed57a435cfacec38/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b0088b3abb1f20ce3afda63/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-960109610.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6910b17fc6b25b7151a61e48/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008f9296a7ef3dfc1e92fa/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-960108974.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008f9296a7ef3dfc1e92fa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-960108974.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008a9fd9d58036a7d004c6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-960174024.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6911fe42f41ba7de3fe83c48/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008d06be93432f8f357aa9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-960033980.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008d45903abc35e09fbf3d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-960128296.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6913ad6972a856e01633db66/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008f9296a7ef3dfc1e92fa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-960108974.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stacey Leasca"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/4-times-prince-harry-made-us-swoon-at-the-well-his-royal-wedding", "title": "4 Times Prince Harry Made Us Swoon at the (Well, His) Royal Wedding", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Stacey Leasca", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Prince Harry was as charming as ever during his wedding ceremony to Meghan Markle on Saturday at Windsor Castle.", "id": "5b007ea2d3a6f5317f1f4b5a", "keywords": "prince harry,royal wedding", "news_keywords": "prince harry,royal wedding", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b007ea2d3a6f5317f1f4b5a", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Prince Harry was as charming as ever during his wedding ceremony to Meghan Markle on Saturday at Windsor Castle.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008f9296a7ef3dfc1e92fa/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-960108974.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008f9296a7ef3dfc1e92fa/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-960108974.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Yes, yes, we KNOW he's off the market now.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008f9296a7ef3dfc1e92fa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-960108974.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "4 Times Prince Harry Made Us Swoon at the (Well, His) Royal Wedding", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/4-times-prince-harry-made-us-swoon-at-the-well-his-royal-wedding"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-05-19T22:15:07.916Z", "modified_time": "2018-05-19T22:15:07.916Z", "author": "Stacey Leasca"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "Yes, yes, we KNOW he's off the market now.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008f9296a7ef3dfc1e92fa/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-960108974.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "4 Times Prince Harry Made Us Swoon at the (Well, His) Royal Wedding"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b008f9296a7ef3dfc1e92fa/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/GettyImages-960108974.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526768107.916, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
