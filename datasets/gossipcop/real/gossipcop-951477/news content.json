It\u2019s all new, so new, but it\u2019s kind of exiting at the same time.\u201d\n\nThe Real for Real Cuisine creator added that while she \u201cwas hoping\u201d to double date with fellow single costar Kelly Dodd, it didn\u2019t happen. Even so, the duo have a \u201cgreat\u201d friendship this season and have \u201ccome to an understanding with each other\u201d amid their respective divorces.\n\nRelated: The Biggest \u2018Real Housewives\u2019 Fights Ever: A Definitive Ranking Don\u2019t mess with a Housewife!

I had to get it out of my system.\u201d The duo called it quits in December 2017, one month after announcing they had separated.\n\nThe Bravo star noted that the breakup has caused a great deal of drama. \u201cMy divorce is anything but friendly right now. There\u2019s a lot of anger, not necessarily coming from me, but there\u2019s just a lot of emotion out there,\u201d she admitted to Us. \u201cIt makes it difficult. I just keep trying to look past it and know that at some point, everything is going to be settled and over and I can completely shut that chapter in my life and move on. I\u2019m really looking forward to that day.\u201d\n\nRelated: Most Tumultuous Relationships in Reality TV History It wouldn\u2019t be reality TV without a little bit of a mess.
