I\u2019m shocked and saddened for Eliza but I am also proud of her \u2013 beyond being a great talent and an amazing woman, she is so courageous. https://t.co/EJJbkdior2 \u2014 Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) January 16, 2018\n\nOver the weekend, Dushku went public with allegations that Kramer sexually molested her when she was 12 years old during filming of True Lies. Since Saturday, several people have come out in support of the actress or to back her claims, including her mother and brother, her former agent, a friend, her legal guardian on the set and co-stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Arnold. The action movie\u2019s director James Cameron said at TCA on Saturday, \u201cHad I known about it, there would have been no mercy.\u201d\n\nShe also claims that after Kramer was confronted by an adult she\u2019d confided in, he intentionally injured her, breaking her ribs, in a stunt that went wrong during filming of the film\u2019s Harrier Jet scene. \u201cWhereas he was supposed to be my protector, he was my abuser,\u201d the Bull actress wrote in a lengthy Facebook posting.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nKramer, whose talent agency dropped him Sunday, has denied Dushku\u2019s allegations.\n\nDushku starred as the daughter of the characters played by Schwarzenegger and Curtis, and Kramer, who has long been Schwarzenegger personal stunt double, was the film\u2019s stunt coordinator.\n\nTwo more women went public today with allegations against Kramer. Although Kramer has denied Dushku\u2019s allegations, he acknowledged that few years later, he had a sexual encounter with the 16-year-old friend of the 15-year-old sister of a stunt woman who worked for him on Virus. The police were called, but said they couldn\u2019t do anything because the age of consent in the state is 16.", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/arnold-schwarzenegger-wonders-of-the-sea-3d.jpg?w=824", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/arnold-schwarzenegger-wonders-of-the-sea-3d.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/arnold-schwarzenegger-wonders-of-the-sea-3d.jpg?w=824", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erik Pedersen", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/01/eliza-dushku-arnold-schwarzenegger-true-lies-sexual-assault-1202243782/", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger \u201cShocked\u201d About Eliza Dushku\u2019s \u2018True Lies\u2019 Allegations, Calls Her \u201cSo Courageous\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "True Lies star Arnold Schwarzenegger weighed in on the Eliza Dushku's allegations of sexual abuse\u00a0at the hands of that 1994 film's stunt coordinator.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Erik Pedersen", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger \u201cShocked\u201d About Eliza Dushku\u2019s \u2018True Lies\u2019 Allegations, Calls Her \u201cSo Courageous\u201d", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/01/eliza-dushku-arnold-schwarzenegger-true-lies-sexual-assault-1202243782/", "description": "True Lies star Arnold Schwarzenegger weighed in on the Eliza Dushku's allegations of sexual abuse\u00a0at the hands of that 1994 film's stunt coordinator.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/arnold-schwarzenegger-wonders-of-the-sea-3d.jpg?w=824", "width": 824, "height": 464, "alt": "Arnold Schwarzenegger Weighs In On Eliza Dushku's 'True Lies' Allegations"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-16T03:09:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2024-12-19T00:39:23+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "True Lies star Arnold Schwarzenegger weighed in on the Eliza Dushku's allegations of sexual abuse\u00a0at the hands of that 1994 film's stunt coordinator.", "site": "@Deadline", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Arnold Schwarzenegger \u201cShocked\u201d About Eliza Dushku\u2019s \u2018True Lies\u2019 Allegations, Calls Her \u201cSo Courageous\u201d", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/arnold-schwarzenegger-wonders-of-the-sea-3d.jpg?w=824"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516072146.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
