Parents were yelling at the projectionist to stop, covering their kids\u2019 eyes and ears. A few went out to get a staff member but she was overwhelmed and didn\u2019t really know what to do. Some parents fled the cinema with their kids in tow.\u201d\n\nEvent Cinemas is currently investigating how the error was made.\n\nHereditary stars Toni Collette, Gabriel Byrne, Alex Wolff and Ann Dowd. It follows a woman\u2019s unravelling of increasingly terrifying secrets about her family\u2019s ancestry following the death of her mother. The film picked up steam after its premiere at Sundance Film Festival where it has since been deemed \u201cthe most traumatically terrifying horror movie in ages\u201d. It will be released in the UK and US in June.\n\nSome have theorised that the mishap could have been a publicity stunt for the film\u2019s release, but The Independent could not verify this.\n\nSubscribe to our writers' new podcast 'The LOST Boys' here.\n\nFollow Independent Culture on Facebook", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/27/09/hereditary-toni-collette.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/27/09/hereditary-toni-collette.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/hereditary-trailer-peter-rabbit-screening-children-traumatised-australia-horror-film-a8324896.html", "title": "Panicked families flee cinema as trailer for 'scariest horror film in years' Hereditary shown in Peter Rabbit screening", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/films/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "'Parents were yelling at the projectionist to stop, covering their kids\u2019 eyes and ears'", "og": {"updated_time": "2018-04-30T08:09:26.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Panicked families flee cinema as terrifying horror trailer is shown before Peter Rabbit screening", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/news/hereditary-trailer-peter-rabbit-screening-children-traumatised-australia-horror-film-a8324896.html", "type": "article", "description": "'Parents were yelling at the projectionist to stop, covering their kids\u2019 eyes and ears'", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/27/09/hereditary-toni-collette.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/27/09/hereditary-toni-collette.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-30T08:09:26.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-04-30T08:09:26.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Film", "author_name": "Jacob Stolworthy", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 503, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 2, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 1, "external_link_count": 5}, "date": "2018-04-30T08:09:26.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176299319"}, "twitter": {"title": "Panicked families flee cinema as terrifying horror trailer is shown before Peter Rabbit screening", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "'Parents were yelling at the projectionist to stop, covering their kids\u2019 eyes and ears'", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/04/27/09/hereditary-toni-collette.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Hereditary\",\"Peter Rabbit\",\"Toni Collette\",\"Ann Dowd\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525075766.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
