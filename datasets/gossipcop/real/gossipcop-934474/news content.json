I also woke up because I am worried you are not wearing enough sunscreen and taking the B-12 I got you from a Costco. I hope this doesn\u2019t wake you.\u201d\n\nShe ended the text with a note for Faris\u2019 Mom co-star, writing, \u201cPlease give Allison Janney our love and congratulations. No one deserves the Oscar more than her.\u201d\n\nParks and Recreation star Adam Scott got a racy text from his grandmother. \u201cSimon Helberg. Holy s**t! Brilliant work in Florence Foster Jenkins. Is it OK for a grandma to lust?\u201d she wrote.\n\nScott replied, \u201cSure, just you truly do not need to text me about it.\u201d\n\nBell had a Kimmel-specific text from her mom during award season.\n\n\u201cHey Kristen, I know that you know Jimmy Kimmel, and he\u2019s doing the Oscars. So tell him to give you all the winners, so you can give me the winners, and I can win at my Oscar party,\u201d she wrote.\n\nYouTube\n\nBlack-ish star Anthony Anderson shared his mom\u2019s demanding Mother\u2019s Day request and got a little payback during the clip.
