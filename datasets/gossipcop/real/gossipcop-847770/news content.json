I did one for my brother first, and it was an '80s mix and it was called the Guess You Had to Be There Mix, and it was a bunch of songs that just worked,\" Pratt told Colbert. \"I knew they would conjure up the same memories and they'd be sentimental for him the way they were for me, and so meaningful.\"\n\n\"He'd call me crying, and I was like, 'I'm the mixtape guy. I can do mixtapes. I'm going to do one for Anna,\" he continued.\n\nNeedless to say, Faris wasn't as receptive.\n\n\"I was thinking in my head, 'This is going to be our lovemaking mix,' you know? And the first song I put was Al Green,\" Pratt explained. \"She was kind of looking at me and I could tell right away, big miss.\"\n\n\n\nWATCH: Anna Faris Stuns in Gorgeous Gown at 'GOTG 2' Premiere -- See Her & Chris Pratt's Cutest Red Carpet Moments!\n\n\"She was like, 'Who are you? You don't listen to Al Green. What are you trying to pull? We're already married, it's cool. I'm going to give it up,'\" he recalled. That was the first and only song we got through and I threw it away. I was so embarrassed.\"\n\nAs for what went wrong, Pratt joked, \"For me, it's the wrong humping tempo.\"\n\n\"I need some EDM,\" he laughed. \"No, just kidding.\"\n\n\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Chris Pratt Talks \u2018Sexy\u2019 Cameo on Wife Anna Faris\u2019 Show \u2018Mom\u2019: \u2018We\u2019ve Been Rehearsing for 10 Years\u2019\n\nWhile Faris might not be the biggest fan of Pratt's mixtapes, she couldn't be more proud of him as an actor.\n\n\"I'm in awe,\" Faris told ET at the premiere of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 last month. \"On the way here I was so much more nervous than Chris was\u2026 I felt like I've always known he's a brilliant actor.
