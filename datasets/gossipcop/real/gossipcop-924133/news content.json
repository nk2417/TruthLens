For instance, it\u2019s only natural since the \u201cBanana Boat Song (Day-O)\u201d really has been stuck in our heads for 30 years.\n\nThe song by Harry Belafonte was released in 1956 but found a new audience after being featured in a memorable scene in Beetlejuice, which was released on March 30, 1988.\n\n<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff</span>\n\nFor example, the movie was the 10th highest-grossing film that year and was met with both box office and critical success, bringing in $164.6 million at the domestic box office (adjusted for inflation) and winning an Academy Award for makeup design.\n\nConsidering this and in celebration of this Burton classic\u2019s 30th anniversary, The Hollywood Reporter takes a look at what the Beetlejuice cast has been up to in the years since, to see how they\u2019ve \u201cjump(ed) in the line\u201d in other projects.\n\nMichael Keaton as Betelgeuse\n\nFun fact: Despite being the namesake of the film, Betelgeuse is on-screen for only about 17 minutes.\n\nWinona Ryder as Lydia Deetz\n\nFun fact: Ryder beat out Juliette Lewis for the part of Lydia, thanks to her role as Rina in the 1986 teen flick Lucas.\n\nAlec Baldwin as Adam Maitland\n\nFun fact: Beetlejuice was only Baldwin\u2019s third feature film after starting off as a TV actor.\n\nGeena Davis as Barbara Maitland\n\nFun fact: Over a decade after Beetlejuice, Davis and Jeffrey Jones both starred in 1999\u2019s Stuart Little.\n\n<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff</span>\n\nContinue on for the rest of this Beetlejuice Cast Update!", "images": ["https://doyouremember.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/beetle.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20960%20541'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://doyouremember.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/doyouremember-logo.png", "https://doyouremember.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/2.jpg", "https://doyouremember.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1.jpg", "https://doyouremember.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/4.jpg", "https://doyouremember.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/beetle-702x351.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20200%20200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/78bd2237656754f97651f8b0acb5a91131b9460b031a3b2f0f5f7825e4e3003c?s=200&d=identicon&r=g", "https://doyouremember.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3.jpg"], "top_img": "https://doyouremember.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/beetle.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zack Walkter"], "canonical_link": "https://doyouremember.com/73315/beetlejuice-turns-30-see-the-cast-then-and-now", "title": "Beetlejuice Turns 30: See The Cast Then And Now", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "In celebration of this Burton classic\u2019s 30th anniversary, we took a look at the cast of Beetlejuice and what they are up to!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Beetlejuice Turns 30: See The Cast Then And Now", "description": "In celebration of this Burton classic\u2019s 30th anniversary, we took a look at the cast of Beetlejuice and what they are up to!", "url": "https://doyouremember.com/73315/beetlejuice-turns-30-see-the-cast-then-and-now", "site_name": "DoYouRemember?", "image": {"identifier": "https://doyouremember.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/beetle.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 500, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DoYouRemember/", "published_time": "2018-04-01T16:11:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-08-16T12:16:43+00:00"}, "author": "Zack Walkter", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@DoYouRemember", "site": "@DoYouRemember", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Zack Walkter", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "theme-color": "#8a2299", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "google-site-verification": "GcAFD5oqPDvTtdW_dIblelB8LL2Td6V4wPH51RU0RKo", "p": {"domain_verify": "b9a4f036b4bf82863a0e68cf57a5c34c"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://doyouremember.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/DoYouRemember_-Knowledge-Graph-Logo.png"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/GuyNP-XyFHs", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/aDm4L7gjYNs"], "publish_date": 1522599088.0, "source": "https://doyouremember.com", "summary": ""}
