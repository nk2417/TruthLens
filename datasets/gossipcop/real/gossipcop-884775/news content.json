Whether it's their lips, bumps or noses, they still remain the hottest style influencers, especially 37-year-old mom of three, Kim Kardashian West who is usually spotted in outfits from hubby, Kanye West's Yeezy collection.\n\nOne of the easiest, none surgical, transformations is a change of hair colour.
