The hackers, known as The Dark Overlord, have traditionally tried to extort their victims, including schools, medical centres, and even a production studio linked to Netflix.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm that the Clinic has been the victim of a cyber attack. We took measures to block the attack immediately in order to protect patient information and we informed the Metropolitan Police who launched an investigation,\u201d London Bridge Plastic Surgery (LBPS), the victim of the hack, told The Daily Beast in a statement.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, following investigations by our IT experts and the police, we believe that our security was breached and that data has been stolen. We are still working to establish exactly what data has been compromised,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nLBPS, based near Marylebone, describes itself as \u201cone of the leading plastic surgery clinics in the UK\u201d on its website. Judging by tabloid media reports, paparazzi have spotted British celebrities attending the clinic, and UK paper The Sun reported that TV star Katie Price is an LBPS customer.\n\n\u201cWe have TBs [terabytes] of this shit. Databases, names, everything,\u201d a representative from The Dark Overlord told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cThere are some royal families in here,\u201d the group claimed.\n\nThe clinic caters to less famous patients too, with plenty of customers praising the company on social media.\n\n\u201cThe clinic staff treated me so so well, with a warm, caring, empathic approach that immediately eased any anxieties I was feeling at the time,\u201d one apparent customer recently wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe Dark Overlord contacted this reporter using an email account belonging to LBPS to prove they had access. The group also sent The Daily Beast a cache of photos of LBPS operations. Many are highly graphic and close-up, showing surgery on male and female genitalia. Others show apparent patients\u2019 bodies post-operation, and some include faces.\n\nNone of a selection of tested photos returned any matches from Google reverse image searches, implying that they were indeed obtained from a private source. Several pictures include LBPS\u2019 chief surgeon Chris Inglefield, wearing his distinctive, multi-colored head scarves. In one image, he is wearing an identical head scarf to that in an image on LBPS\u2019 website.\n\nAs if the hack itself wasn\u2019t enough of an issue, the hackers have threatened to distribute the stolen images.\n\n\u201cWe're going to pitch it all up for everyone to nab. The entire patient list with corresponding photos. The world has never seen a medical dump of a plastic surgeon to such degree,\u201d The Dark Overlord told The Daily Beast last week. The images do not appear to be publicly available yet, however, and it\u2019s unclear whether the group will follow through on their threat.\n\n\u201cThis blokes balls were nicked mate!\u201d the representative added, referring to a specific photo in the cache. The group often mocks or taunts its victims, both in public social media posts or during interviews with reporters.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a straight male, yeah?\u201d they continued. \u201cHow about some actual real vaginas,\u201d they said, before sending this reporter several sets of graphic photos. LBPS confirmed the data breach after The Daily Beast provided a number of the clinic\u2019s photos to representatives.\n\nAfter the publication of this article, a Metropolitan Police Service spokesperson told The Daily Beast, \"On Tuesday, 17 October the Metropolitan Police Service was informed of a data theft from a cosmetic surgery clinic in London. Detectives from the Met's Organised Crime Command are investigating. There have been no arrests and enquires are ongoing.\"\n\nThe Dark Overlord first emerged in mid-2016, when they hacked a myriad of medical centers across the U.S., then moved onto commercial businesses and most recently schools. Earlier this month, The Daily Beast reported the group sent a flurry of death threats to students of an Iowa school district. Education officials closed a number of schools in response.\n\nUsually, The Dark Overlord will hack a victim, steal their data, and then demand a ransom payment in exchange for not publicly releasing the, often sensitive, information. When that doesn\u2019t work, the group may approach journalists in the hope that media coverage will put more pressure onto the target. LBPS\u2019 statement did not explicitly mention an extortion attempt.\n\nIn all, The Dark Overlord has hacked well over a dozen targets, mostly, it appears, in the U.S., but some overseas. Senator Steve Daines recently raised concerns about the group with FBI Director Christopher Wray, the Flathead Beacon previously reported.\n\n\u201cWe are horrified that they have now targeted our patients,\u201d the LBPS statement continued.\n\n\"Security and patient confidentiality has always been of the utmost importance to us. We invest in market-leading technology to keep our data secure and our systems are updated daily. We are deeply saddened that our security has been breached. We are profoundly sorry for any distress this data breach may cause our patients and our team are available around the clock to speak to anyone who has any concerns by calling 0203 858 0664,\u201d it concluded.", "images": ["https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/fb.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/email-icon.svg?d=342", "https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/1741381130319.png", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/images/obsessed-header-logo-h-2.png?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/24X25VZOCZLLJMPB5E6ABRJQLY.jpg?smart=true&auth=55cca44ca8600c47087bc9a091699845660d3f4b0640b4c54b61aaa3a5800376&width=1600&height=900", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/7L6PYMCE7RHEBIJZKR23DVTIJI.jpg?smart=true&auth=2558e4fc878237f3ad5bb1aa41ed598bebc770410fe3c21b06f961d190dd7689&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/72QNEDSQAVCFHA7Z4MRIDT3K5M.jpg?smart=true&auth=e85c64c943308a204606bc607c0e7733ba520df4c38b4e0e3d31028410470fd8&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/google_play.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/twitter-icon.svg?d=342", "https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/thedailybeast/E6UEUV62G5KWLEFWRRBPTXP56Q.jpg", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/reddit.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/Q6VCSZVA2RAGNOY6RHL3JBDX7U.jpg?smart=true&auth=696d13f7ff11f29130823ec818b6cf4c2a2514821a3fc754adf0dd8b4025ae04&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BFH2PPZ3N5AWTJGR4I7VGCQSD4.jpg?smart=true&auth=306b5742d88bb08e4375bb425722a6636b1c6e2e68736060ebab624f8c524c27&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/app_store.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/24X25VZOCZLLJMPB5E6ABRJQLY.jpg?smart=true&auth=55cca44ca8600c47087bc9a091699845660d3f4b0640b4c54b61aaa3a5800376&width=1200&height=630", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/SDEZH4IJYVANHG7SB7OHOLN25Y.png?smart=true&auth=f6c5d3a487876ce737293fc82e0d933b093632d4a0460243076f5ddaaedf4e9a&width=1440&height=1080"], "top_img": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/24X25VZOCZLLJMPB5E6ABRJQLY.jpg?smart=true&auth=55cca44ca8600c47087bc9a091699845660d3f4b0640b4c54b61aaa3a5800376&width=1200&height=630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joseph Cox", "Josephfranciscox Gmail.Com", "Got A Tip", "Send It To The Daily Beast", "Farrah Tomazin", "Julia Ornedo", "Leigh Kimmins", "Cameron Adams"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/hackers-steal-photos-from-plastic-surgeon-to-the-stars-claim-they-include-royals/", "title": "Hackers Steal Photos From Plastic Surgeon to the Stars, Claim Trove Includes Royals", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The Dark Overlord, a hacking group known for mocking and extorting victims, has now stolen highly personal photos from a plastic surgeon in London.", "twitter": {"description": "The Dark Overlord, a hacking group known for mocking and extorting victims, has now stolen highly personal photos from a plastic surgeon in London.", "title": "Hackers Steal Photos From Plastic Surgeon to the Stars", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/24X25VZOCZLLJMPB5E6ABRJQLY.jpg?smart=true&auth=55cca44ca8600c47087bc9a091699845660d3f4b0640b4c54b61aaa3a5800376&width=1200&height=630", "alt": "171023-cox-surgery-hack-tease_tjf8r6"}, "site": "@https://twitter.com/thedailybeast", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"description": "The Dark Overlord, a hacking group known for mocking and extorting victims, has now stolen highly personal photos from a plastic surgeon in London.", "title": "Hackers Steal Photos From Plastic Surgeon to the Stars", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/24X25VZOCZLLJMPB5E6ABRJQLY.jpg?smart=true&auth=55cca44ca8600c47087bc9a091699845660d3f4b0640b4c54b61aaa3a5800376&width=1200&height=630", "alt": "171023-cox-surgery-hack-tease_tjf8r6"}, "type": "article", "site_name": "The Daily Beast", "url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/hackers-steal-photos-from-plastic-surgeon-to-the-stars-claim-they-include-royals/"}, "keywords": "plastic-surgery,royals,hacking,disinformation", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "loadforge-site-verification": "3ac1d76b00b152231dc1bef253b8d571e663ffa9b4826b38646ee6d4a23225d2a762aac1254120868ebecd9c4666ad563ef03b99a25d3966cba08ee2380aa43b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.thedailybeast.com", "summary": ""}
