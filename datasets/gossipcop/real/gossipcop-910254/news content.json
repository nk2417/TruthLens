We were supposed to induce her today but Carly\u2019s water broke 15 minutes before our alarm went off so Bella is setting her own birthday!\u201d Bass said in a statement. \u201cCarly is recovering well and the baby has had her eyes open for hours. I cried a lot during the birth! We are smitten and cannot stop kissing, cuddling and adoring her.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Carly Waddell\n\nWaddell, 32, and Bass met on season 3 of the ABC reality series. The two tied the knot last June in the same place they fell in love: Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, televising their wedding on season 4 of BIP.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

While Waddell wouldn\u2019t allow Bass to name their daughter Evan, they were both overjoyed to reveal her moniker, explaining that they would call the newborn Bella for short.\n\n\u201cMy sweet Grandma Bass was named Evelyn and she was the best and I hope that our daughter is fierce like her,\u201d Bass said at the time.\n\nBella is Waddell\u2019s first child and Bass\u2019 fourth. His other three children \u2014 Nathan, Liam and Ensley \u2014 are from a previous relationship.", "images":
