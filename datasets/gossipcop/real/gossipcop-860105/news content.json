Starring Courtney Love, Nico Tortorella, Myko Olivier, and Benito Martinez, it is based on the lives of Lyle and Erik Menendez, two brothers who were convicted of murdering their parents in Beverly Hills, California in 1989.\n\nThe film aired on the Lifetime network in North America on June 11, 2017.[3][4]\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nOn January 31, 2017, it was announced that Courtney Love had joined the cast of the film.[6] Cooper Koch auditioned for the role of Erik Menendez before Myko Olivier was ultimately cast alongside Nico Tortorella as Lyle Menendez.[7][8] Koch would eventually portray Erik Menendez in the Netflix limited series Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story (2024). The film was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, between February and March 2017.[6]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nKen Tucker, writing for Yahoo! TV, found the film to be \"a melodramatic mess\" that \"resembles a creepy high-school play\" in quality.[9] Similarly, New York Post critic Robert Rorke lambasted the murder scene in Menendez: Blood Brothers as \"creepy and amateurish\" and felt the film generally lacked any insight.[10]\n\nBroadly's Mitchell Sunderland, on the other hand, praised the film's tone and Love's performance in particular, stating that \"Courtney Love's performance as Kitty holds the film together\", highlighting her ability to be \"over-the-top in one scene, and subtle the next, without the performance seeming disjointed.\"[11]\n\nSee also [ edit ]", "images": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/Menendez%2C_Blood_Brothers_Lifetime.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0b/Menendez%2C_Blood_Brothers_Lifetime.png/250px-Menendez%2C_Blood_Brothers_Lifetime.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/Menendez%2C_Blood_Brothers_Lifetime.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menendez:_Blood_Brothers", "title": "Menendez: Blood Brothers", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0b/Menendez%2C_Blood_Brothers_Lifetime.png", "width": 800, "height": 1200}, "title": "Menendez: Blood Brothers - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
