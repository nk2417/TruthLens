Beyond his impact as a multi-hyphenate force in our industry, Judd\u2019s comedic chops, social consciousness, and lifelong love of film and television underlie his unique ability to entertain with heart \u2013 whether behind the scenes or in front of a live audience. And when it comes to expertise in live events, specials, and awards, nothing compares to the great Don Mischer. To our Guild\u2019s fortune, Don has graciously agreed to add Awards Chair to his growing list of service and contributions to our Guild.\u201d\n\nJudd Apatow\n\nJudd Apatow is considered one of the most sought-after comedy minds in the business. He has been closely associated with many of the biggest comedy films and hit television shows over the last decade and a half.\n\nApatow recently filmed his upcoming Netflix standup special, The Return, at the Just for Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal. The Return premiered on December 12 and marks Judd\u2019s first solo standup special and literal return to his first love of performing standup which is how he began his career 25 years ago when he performed on HBO\u2019s Young Comedians special in 1992.\n\nApatow made his documentary directorial debut with the 2016 Emmy Award-nominated ESPN Films 30 for 30 feature, Doc & Darryl, which chronicled the successes and scandals of New York Mets legends Dwight \u201cDoc\u201d Gooden and Darryl Strawberry. He followed that up with the forthcoming co-directed HBO documentary, May It Last, about folk rock icons the Avett Brothers premiering on HBO later this month.\n\nContinuing down the documentarian path, Apatow is in post-production on a documentary on Garry Shandling who served as Judd\u2019s mentor and father figure. The two-part documentary will air over two nights in late March on HBO.\n\nAdditionally, Apatow currently serves as co-executive producer of the television series Crashing, which returns to HBO for its second season in January 2018. He is also the co-executive producer of Netflix\u2019s Love which returns for its third season in March 2018. Lastly, Apatow co-executive produced the multi-award-winning HBO series Girls which wrapped its final season earlier this year.\n\nOn the film side, Apatow recently produced the 2017 romantic comedy, The Big Sick, starring Kumail Nanjiani, Holly Hunter and Ray Romano. The dark horse box office success earned a 97% on Rotten Tomatoes which was the highest rated film of the summer.\n\nApatow has written and directed such films as The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Trainwreck. He has also produced Superbad, Bridesmaids, Pineapple Express, and both Anchorman films, to name but a few.\n\nApatow has been a DGA member for two decades.\n\nDon Mischer\n\nDon Mischer is an internationally acclaimed producer and director of television and live events.
