Bravo has been so supportive.\u201d\n\nPEOPLE broke the news exclusively on July 16 that she had returned to rehab for a second time, with costar Bethenny Frankel calling the decision \u201cbrave and honest.\u201d\n\nIn turn, she missed the taping of the RHONY season 10 reunion.\n\n\u201cThis weekend, Luann was surrounded by her girlfriends and decided \u2014 with their support \u2014 that in light of recent circumstances, it is the healthiest choice for her not to attend Tuesday\u2019s reunion taping so that she can continue in her healing process,\u201d said Frankel, whom de Lesseps authorized to speak on her behalf. \u201cLuann is now surrounded by a core group of people who truly have her best interests at heart and who are working to make sure she gets the help she needs.\u201d\n\nAdded the network in a statement: \u201cBravo supports Luann\u2019s decision to focus on her health. She is part of the Bravo family and we continue to stand by her as she copes with this challenging situation. At this time, we hope everyone will respect her privacy.\u201d\n\nJohn Lamparski/Getty\n\nIt\u2019s been a tough year for de Lesseps.\n\nThe Countess was arrested in the early morning hours of Dec. 24 and released on her own recognizance that same day after allegedly attacking a police officer in Palm Beach, Florida. She recently struck a plea deal in the case, and will avoid jail time.\n\nAfter her arrest, de Lesseps \u2014 who had gotten married to ex-husband Tom D\u2019Agostino in Palm Beach on the previous New Year\u2019s Eve before their divorce seven months later \u2014 released a statement, saying, \u201cThis was my first time in Palm Beach since my wedding, and being here brought up long-buried emotions. I want to offer my sincere apologies to anyone I might have offended with my behavior. I am committed to a transformative and hopeful 2018.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Luann de Lesseps Says Her Arrest Cost Her Friends and Boyfriends\n\nPrior to her return to rehab, news broke that her first husband, Alexandre de Lesseps, her daughter, Victoria de Lesseps, and son, Noel de Lesseps, filed a lawsuit against her over an $8 million house sale. According to court documents obtained by The Blast, she breached a stipulation of settlement in her divorce by failing to create a trust \u201cfor the benefit of her two children.\u201d\n\nThe source close to mother of two said that lawsuit was a driving factor in her heading to rehab.\n\n\u201cDue to the trauma of being sued by her kids and ex husband, Luann decided to set the reset button and check herself into rehab,\u201d the insider said. \u201cShe read about it in the press which was devastating and after that, needed to work on herself and digest everything and be self-reflective.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe lawyers are speaking on both sides and Luann is hoping for a speedy resolution because she loves her children very much,\u201d the source added.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New York City airs Wednesdays (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.", "images":
