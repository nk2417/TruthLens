{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shondaland", "text": "American television production company\n\nNot to be confused with Mashonaland\n\nShondaland (stylized as ShondaLand from 2005 to 2016 and shondaland thereafter) is an American television production company founded by television writer and producer Shonda Rhimes.[1] She founded it to be one of the production companies of her first series, the medical drama Grey's Anatomy in 2005. It has since gone on to produce Rhimes's other creations, Grey's spinoff Private Practice and the political drama Scandal, and her other productions\u2014the short-lived Off the Map, the Viola Davis-starring legal thriller How to Get Away with Murder, and the crime thriller The Catch\u2014all of which are co-produced with ABC Studios and air on ABC. As of 2017, it has a partnership affiliation with Netflix creating shows like Bridgerton and the spin-off Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nProgramming block [ edit ]\n\nIn 2014, the ABC network programmed its entire Thursday primetime lineup with television series produced by Shondaland, then branded the Shondaland-filled programming block as \"Thank God It's Thursday,\" also referred to in its shortened form, TGIT.[2] This echoes ABC's former TGIF branding of its Friday night family sitcoms[3] and NBC's Must See TV promotion of formidable Thursday night television hits in the 1990s. Thursday is an especially important night for American television networks because it is the last chance for advertisers of weekend purchases, like movies and cars, to reach a large TV audience, and networks schedule highly rated programming for the night to attract those advertising dollars.[4] The Associated Press called Rhimes' reign of an entire night of network television \"unmatched in TV history.\"[5]\n\nProductions [ edit ]\n\nThe first series produced by Shondaland is Grey's Anatomy, which premiered on March 27, 2005, and was recently renewed for its 22nd season.[6][7] In 2007, Private Practice premiered, and lasted for six seasons, until its final broadcast, on January 22, 2013.[8] The third installment, Off the Map, was created by Jenna Bans and lasted for only one season, in 2011.[9] Scandal and How to Get Away with Murder, premiered in 2012 and 2014, respectively, with Scandal airing its final episode on April 19, 2018, and How to Get Away with Murder airing its final episode on May 14, 2020. The comedy-driven crime drama The Catch aired for two seasons and received generally positive reviews from critics.[10] The period drama Still Star-Crossed premiered on May 29, 2017, and was cancelled after one season.[11] The legal drama For the People, created by Paul William Davies and set to premiere in the 2017\u201318 television season,[12] is the eighth television series produced by Shondaland. In May 2019, it was cancelled after two seasons.[13] It was announced on January 3, 2018, that Scandal and How to Get Away With Murder would crossover with one another in Shondaland's first crossover event (excluding spin-offs).[14] In March 22, 2018, a second Grey's Anatomy spin-off, Station 19, premiered. This firefighter procedural drama lasted for seven seasons, broadcasting its final episode on May 30, 2024.[15]\n\nWebsite [ edit ]\n\nIn 2017, Shondaland launched the lifestyle website Shondaland.com in partnership with Hearst.[16]\n\nInitiatives [ edit ]\n\nShonda Rhimes shares her knowledge with aspiring screenwriters and producers through Shondaland and initiatives for her MasterClass.com program.[17]\n\nShondaland partnered with Seriesfest[18] in 2019 to launch the Women's Directing Mentorship,[19] a competition designed to discover aspiring female directors.[20][21] The Seriesfest panel included Shondaland's Head of Fiction Alison Eakle, Akua Murphy, Katie Lowes and Anna Deavere Smith.[22] The first Shondaland Women's Directing Mentorship was awarded to Rachel Myers.[23]\n\nIn January 2020, it was announced that Shonda Rhimes had partnered with iHeartMedia to launch Shondaland Audio.[24]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nTelevision series [ edit ]\n\nRecurring actors [ edit ]\n\nSome actors appear in more than one television show produced by Shondaland.
