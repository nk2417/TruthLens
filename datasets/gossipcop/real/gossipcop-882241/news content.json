Last week, CBS canceled the sitcom after two seasons.\n\nOn Wednesday, CBS execs admitted that the choice to make James\u2019 character a widower didn\u2019t go over well with viewers. \u201cCreatively, the show made a choice at the beginning of last year,\u201d said CBS Entertainment senior executive vice president Thom Sherman. \u201cWe agreed to go along with it and unfortunately the audience didn\u2019t respond to it.\u201d\n\nCBS first revealed the storyline last summer during the Television Critics Association press tour, after the choice was made to bring James\u2019 \u201cThe King of Queens\u201d co-star, Leah Remini, on \u201cKevin Can Wait\u201d full time.\n\nAs part of a massive shift when \u201cKevin Can Wait\u201d returned for its sophomore run, about 10 months passed since Hayes\u2019 character\u2019s death, allowing for James\u2019 character to have moved on.\n\nAccording to James, speaking to the New York Daily News in October, the thought process behind Donna\u2019s departure was to bring a new direction to the show, one that would allow for it to run for more seasons and be \u201clengthier.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe plot of the show didn\u2019t have enough drive. If we got through a second season, I wouldn\u2019t see us getting through a third one,\u201d James said before he admitted they \u201cwere literally running out of ideas.\u201d\n\nJames said at the time that the original idea for his character was to be portrayed as a single father, but the show later made the decision to add a wife character.\n\nBut this past season, with Hayes gone, and the well-publicized decision to have her character die, ratings dropped. \u201cIt was a strong show for us, and it had a lot of decline this year, it was headed in the wrong direction,\u201d said CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl. \u201cThe numbers were going down. Looking forward it didn\u2019t look like a show that could anchor a night for us.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/140134_1074_r2.jpg?w=600&h=480&crop=1", "https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/caitlin-clark-wnbpa-panini.png?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/108108_d0996b.jpg?w=1200&h=817&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2246465707.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2243714058.jpg?w=3000&h=2800&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TNB_05859_R-H-2024-1.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GettyImages-1813814630.jpg?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7135.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Warner-Bros.-Discovery.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/timeless-designated-survivor-criminal-minds.jpg?w=600&h=480&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/anaconda.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/jelly-roll.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thoughts-and-prayers-hbo.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/147571_0233.jpg?w=600&h=480&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple_TV_Your_Friends_and_Neighbors_key_art_graphic_header_16_9_show_home.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-01-at-8.32.46\u202fPM.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2243843179.jpg?w=3000&h=2425&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/HZBN_S2_FG_208_00353223_Still731_3000.jpg?w=3000&h=1688&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WBD_UPFRONT_24_25_0012.jpg?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2243810544.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Eli-Feingold-e1763691944397.jpeg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/108108_d0996b.jpg?w=650", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mikeheadshot-copy-e1464735337462.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/147152_0274r2.jpg?w=600&h=480&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/108108_d0996b.jpg?w=650", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Schneider"], "canonical_link": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/kevin-can-wait-erinn-hayes-death-kevin-james-cbs-1201965247/", "title": "\u2018Kevin Can Wait\u2019: CBS Admits That Viewers Were Not Happy With Erinn Hayes\u2019 Character\u2019s Death", "meta_data": {"description": "Ratings declined this season, as the show shifted focus and brought on Kevin James' former \"King of Queens\" partner Leah Remini.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400654071", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Michael Schneider", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Kevin Can Wait\u2019: CBS Admits That Viewers Were Not Happy With Erinn Hayes\u2019 Character\u2019s Death", "url": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/kevin-can-wait-erinn-hayes-death-kevin-james-cbs-1201965247/", "description": "Ratings declined this season, as the show shifted focus and brought on Kevin James' former \"King of Queens\" partner Leah Remini.", "site_name": "IndieWire", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/108108_d0996b.jpg?w=650", "width": 650, "height": 443, "alt": "CBS"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-16T14:56:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-16T14:56:27+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ratings declined this season, as the show shifted focus and brought on Kevin James' former \"King of Queens\" partner Leah Remini.", "site": "@IndieWire", "creator": "@franklinavenue", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Kevin Can Wait\u2019: CBS Admits That Viewers Were Not Happy With Erinn Hayes\u2019 Character\u2019s Death", "image": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/108108_d0996b.jpg?w=650"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-iw_favicon.png?w=270", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526482587.0, "source": "https://www.indiewire.com", "summary": ""}
