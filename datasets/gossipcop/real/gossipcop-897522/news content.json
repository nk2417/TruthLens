In \u201cNumber One,\u201d when he visited his high school for the retirement of his jersey number, he hit a new low. He slept with an old classmate-turned-doctor and stole a sheet off her prescription pad \u2014 and then lost his father\u2019s necklace, his symbol of hope.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure that we told a story that was honest and true, especially because this is something that people deal with a lot,\u201d Hartley tells Variety. \u201cIt\u2019s very dangerous. You can lose your wealth, you can lose your friends, you can lose your trust, you can lose your dignity, you can lose everything. We didn\u2019t want to just tell a drug story real quick and then just wrap it up in a bow.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nHere, Hartley talks with Variety about whether Kevin\u2019s breakdown in \u201cNumber One\u201d is his true rock bottom, whether he\u2019ll be able to help Kate, and how his father\u2019s death plays into all of his issues.\n\nKevin was clearly in pain, and a couple of times actually verbalized that, and yet no one could really see him through his celebrity. What were the conversations around why that happened?\n\nSome of the things we came to were just that people just assume that you\u2019re OK. I\u2019ve actually done it \u2014 I\u2019ve been on the other end of it where something will happen and it\u2019s catastrophic, and you\u2019re sitting there like, \u201cWhat the hell? How did this happen out of nowhere?\u201d But then you go replay it, and you realize, \u201cOh my God, my friend was doing this and I wasn\u2019t paying attention.\u201d The next thing you know he\u2019s in the hospital, and it wasn\u2019t all of a sudden but for whatever reason, I was choosing to think he was OK. And I think part of Kevin\u2019s thing that he goes through is that he had football when he was a kid, he was popular in high school, he\u2019s an actor, he has money, he has friends \u2014 I put that in quotes \u2014 he had Sophie, everybody likes him. So people just assume he\u2019s always OK. He\u2019s always making jokes, he\u2019s charming.\n\nDo you feel like this episode was Kevin\u2019s rock bottom? Is he ready to get better now?\n\nI hope so. I think something\u2019s got to give. This episode meant so much to me because I know what it means to carry the weight of a relationship on your shoulders and be like, \u201cAs long as that person is kicking and breathing and in my life, there\u2019s a chance there will be closure, there\u2019s a chance that something might happen.\u201d And then when he loses that necklace, it was like all hope was lost. So hopefully that\u2019s his rock bottom, because I think sometimes you need that to realize where the hell they are.\n\nAt the end, it seems like he finally wants to ask for help from Randall (Sterling K. Brown), but he\u2019s met with another family tragedy in Kate\u2019s (Chrissy Metz) miscarriage.\n\nAnd how interesting is that that Kevin and Randall have this very difficult relationship [but] he actually goes back to get help from Randall? How close Kate and Kevin are, it\u2019s interesting that he goes to Randall. He doesn\u2019t have his dad, and I think if his dad was there he\u2019d obviously go to him, but he knows Randall will be there for him. But when he gets there, it\u2019s like, \u201cThis is not about you, man. We can\u2019t do this right now.\u201d So he is self-aware enough to realize there\u2019s a bigger story here \u2014 which is also kind of heartbreaking, as well, because he needs help right now, and he\u2019s not really in a position to get it. It\u2019s tough.\n\nDo you think Kevin has been aware of the parallels between his addiction and his father\u2019s?\n\nThe injury happened, and I think there was a moment where he didn\u2019t want to take the medication for fear that he would go down that path. I don\u2019t think he just took it and thought, \u201cWell, whatever.\u201d I think he is aware of the gene in the family, that they\u2019re all addicts, more than anyone else. He sees what Kate goes through and what his dad went through, and he\u2019s aware that he has that in him. And so, when he finally chooses to take the medication, I think it was just because the pain was legitimately too much, and he didn\u2019t want to fail at anything, and he was going to go to whatever lengths to succeed at this one thing and that it would be fine [because] he only needed it for a second. But of course that\u2019s not how that stuff works. And I think once he was in that state of being high and drunk and depressed and alone, he just kept shoveling crap on top of himself. He was the one inflicting pain on himself, and he\u2019s not capable of dealing with it. And once he was in that state of f\u2013ked up, I don\u2019t think much was going through his head about drawing the parallels, it was just, \u201cHow can I feel sorry for myself and inflict as much pain because I deserve it?\u201d It was just a self-loathing, awful place.\n\nThat being said, he didn\u2019t spiral down a completely dark rabbit hole of partying with teenagers.\n\nWell, he\u2019s not a criminal! He\u2019s got morals, he\u2019s not a bad person.\n\nBut sometimes when you\u2019re that messed up, you\u2019re not thinking clearly and you do reprehensible things.\n\nYeah, and one of the things that happens with Kevin is that I think he\u2019s aware of the fact that he doesn\u2019t really want to bring anyone else down there with him. That\u2019s a kid \u2014 she\u2019s probably 18 in the show, but that\u2019s a child, and he\u2019s 37 years old. And also, he\u2019s not in a position where he\u2019s trying to have company. The whole Charlotte thing happened, in my mind, because he\u2019s smart enough to realize that she\u2019s a doctor and has access to something that he needs. I think that was a calculated move on his part.\n\nKevin didn\u2019t fully break down and ask for help until he realized he lost his father\u2019s necklace. So do you feel like he won\u2019t be able to truly fix the other things in his life until he finally deals with his father\u2019s death?\n\nI think so. It\u2019s not only his father\u2019s death, it\u2019s how he died and the whole Miguel thing and the rift that he had with his mom. It\u2019s all of that combined. I think it\u2019s all together. I think the knee will heal on its own, and I think he can kick this drug habit that he has for a while, but at the root of it, eventually he\u2019s going to have to go down that path and deal with his father\u2019s death or otherwise it\u2019s a slippery slope and like a record that just keeps repeating. He had to deal with the fact that that necklace and whatever it symbolized to him meant so much to him. It was the last physical object he had of his father, and he never got any closure of his relationship with his father. And you start to see what he was going through with his father when he died \u2014 and they weren\u2019t in a good place. He carries that around with him, and I think that necklace that he wore was the promise of a better day.\n\nHow will the show shed more light on how Jack died in the next few episodes?\n\nWe\u2019ve seen it with Kate, we\u2019ve seen her kind of admit that she feels responsible for her father\u2019s death, and I think what you see as the show goes on is they all have that guilt that they carry. You can blame yourself for anything \u2014 you can blame yourself for things that might not be your fault. And I think everybody involved carries a lot of guilt, especially for Kevin because as you see in [this] episode, in that moment in time, he was not nice to [Jack]; he was a little prick. But at the same time, I see both sides of the story. He was embarrassed. His father told him certain things, and he sees his father in a certain way and thinks, \u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t make mistakes, and I\u2019m going to be just like him,\u201d and that\u2019s not at all what it was. He\u2019s got some anger and resentment toward his father, and he\u2019s at that age where all of your anger and resentment comes to the surface anyway. It\u2019s kind of a perfect storm.\n\nWere you operating under the assumption that the necklace came from Jack\u2019s brother and that Kevin even knows his father has a brother?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult because this show is constantly changing. When you think you know something, something else will happen, and you\u2019re like \u201cOK,\u201d and that\u2019s the nature of the show. I choose to operate under the assumption that yeah, I do know, but I also know he doesn\u2019t talk about it. But I could be totally wrong, by the way. I could find out that Kevin doesn\u2019t know. What we do know, what he says, is that he was given it at a time when he was lost and had no direction and felt like he had no purpose. So, that story will be told.\n\n\u201cThis Is Us\u201d airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. on NBC.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/this-is-us1.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/this-is-us1.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Danielle Turchiano", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/features/this-is-us-justin-hartley-season-2-interview-addiction-jacks-death-1202614001/", "title": "\u2018This Is Us\u2019: Justin Hartley on Kevin\u2019s Addiction, Jack\u2019s Death and the Necklace (SPOILERS)", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"This Is Us\" star Justin Hartley talks about Kevin's rock bottom, guilt over his father's death, and diving into an addiction storyline.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Danielle Turchiano", "tags": "Justin Hartley, This Is Us", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018This Is Us\u2019: Justin Hartley on Kevin\u2019s Addiction, Jack\u2019s Death and the Necklace (SPOILERS)", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/features/this-is-us-justin-hartley-season-2-interview-addiction-jacks-death-1202614001/", "description": "\"This Is Us\" star Justin Hartley talks about Kevin's rock bottom, guilt over his father's death, and diving into an addiction storyline.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/this-is-us1.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "This Is Us Season 2"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-15T03:00:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-15T03:00:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"This Is Us\" star Justin Hartley talks about Kevin's rock bottom, guilt over his father's death, and diving into an addiction storyline.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@danielletbd", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018This Is Us\u2019: Justin Hartley on Kevin\u2019s Addiction, Jack\u2019s Death and the Necklace (SPOILERS)", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/this-is-us1.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510714802.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
