In A Quiet Late Late, Corden plays an annoying co-worker who will barge in on group activities if he hears the slightest sound.\n\n\u201cIf he hears you, he will join you,\u201d the trailer warns. Indeed, when Corden hears the sound of a Late Late Show employee biting into a chip in the breakroom, he joins his colleagues for lunch, much to their dismay. Not only does Corden steal their fries, but he incites major eye rolls when he gleefully shows off his new fidget-spinner.\n\nLater, things get a bit more intense when his co-workers play a silent game of Monopoly \u2014 directly referencing a scene from A Quiet Place \u2014 and an employee can\u2019t help but cheer out loud when he wins the game. \u201cMaybe he didn\u2019t hear,\u201d another player whispers in fear, just before Corden pops up out of nowhere.\n\n\u201cYou guys playing Monopoly? I love Monopoly!\u201d he says, completely unaware of how unwanted his presence is. \u201cI\u2019ll be the thimble. You guys here the whole time? I didn\u2019t even hear you.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the clip, a co-worker\u2019s phone rings and it only takes seconds before Corden finds him. That\u2019s when the employee discovers Corden\u2019s weakness: physical exertion. \u201cHe will force you to include him,\u201d states the trailer. \u201cUnless you run away.\u201d\n\nAfter a short sprint, Corden gives up, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll catch up with you later. We had fun! That\u2019s a fun game.\u201d\n\nCorden\u2019s take on A Quiet Place comes after the movie made more than $50 million over the weekend. In the film, which has earned rave reviews, Krasinski and his wife, Blunt, play a couple who live in isolation with their two children. In order to avoid being killed by spider-like monsters who are acutely attracted to sound, they make a concerted attempt to never make any noise.\n\nThe project marks Krasinski\u2019s first screenplay and his third directorial effort since he and Blunt got married in 2010. The Paramount Pictures feature was recently cleared by China\u2019s censors and secured a release date (May 18), which is rare for a horror film in the communist country.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/a_quiet_late_late_-_a_quiet_place_parody_0.jpg?w=1280&h=722&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/a_quiet_late_late_-_a_quiet_place_parody_0.jpg?w=1280&h=722&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evan Real", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/james-corden-parodies-a-quiet-place-late-late-show-1102040/", "title": "James Corden Parodies \u2018A Quiet Place\u2019 on \u2018The Late Late Show\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "After 'A Quiet Place' opened to astounding numbers at the box office, James Corden evoked fear as the co-worker from hell in a spoof on 'The Late Late Show.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Evan Real", "tags": "A Quiet Place, Emily Blunt, James Corden, John Krasinski, Late Night TV, The Late Late Show", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "James Corden Parodies \u2018A Quiet Place\u2019 on \u2018The Late Late Show\u2019", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/james-corden-parodies-a-quiet-place-late-late-show-1102040/", "description": "After 'A Quiet Place' opened to astounding numbers at the box office, James Corden evoked fear as the co-worker from hell in a spoof on 'The Late Late Show.'", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/a_quiet_late_late_-_a_quiet_place_parody_0.jpg?w=1280&h=722&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 578, "alt": "James Corden Parodies 'A Quiet Place' on 'The Late Late Show'"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-12T07:59:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-29T06:43:21+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "After 'A Quiet Place' opened to astounding numbers at the box office, James Corden evoked fear as the co-worker from hell in a spoof on 'The Late Late Show.'", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "James Corden Parodies \u2018A Quiet Place\u2019 on \u2018The Late Late Show\u2019", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/a_quiet_late_late_-_a_quiet_place_parody_0.jpg?w=1280&h=722&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523519955.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
