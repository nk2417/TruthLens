It was due for a Friday delivery with a physical version scheduled to drop June 2.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/prince-paddock-performance-2011-billboard-650-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/prince-paddock-performance-2011-billboard-650-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colin Stutz", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/pro/prince-deliverance-ep-unreleased-material-removed/", "title": "Prince\u2019s \u2018Deliverance\u2019 EP Removed From Streaming Services", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Prince's new collection of unreleased material may, in fact, stay unreleased.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Colin Stutz", "tags": "Digital & Mobile", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Prince\u2019s \u2018Deliverance\u2019 EP Removed From Streaming Services", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/pro/prince-deliverance-ep-unreleased-material-removed/", "description": "Prince's new collection of unreleased material may, in fact, stay unreleased.
