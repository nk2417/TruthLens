In February, David confessed to PEOPLE that the two were no longer in contact.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t her father. I was her biological father but I didn\u2019t raise her. She has a completely different life,\u201d he explained. \u201c[But] I\u2019m proud of her. She\u2019s very talented. It\u2019s hard for me to even accept how old she is now.\u201d\n\nKrista Kennell/ZUMA\n\nDavid had been in intensive care since he was hospitalized for liver and kidney failure last week.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the entire Cassidy family, it is with great sadness that we announce the passing of our father, our uncle, and our dear brother, David Cassidy,\u201d his family said in a statement to PEOPLE on Tuesday. \u201cDavid died surrounded by those he loved, with joy in his heart and free from the pain that had gripped him for so long. Thank you for the abundance and support you have shown him these many years.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Katie, David is survived by son Beau Cassidy; brothers Shaun, Patrick and Ryan; stepmother Shirley Jones; and numerous nieces, nephews and cousins. Plans for a memorial and funeral service have not yet been disclosed.", "images":
