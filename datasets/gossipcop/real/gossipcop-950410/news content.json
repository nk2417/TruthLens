Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick\u2018s only daughter hits a milestone today, and while we\u2019re already expecting the pint-sized cutie to spend her day playing with cousin North West, we\u2019re also reminiscing about how far Penelope has come since making her debut on Keeping Up with the Kardashians. Not only is the 4-year-old stylish, but she\u2019s also the epitome of cool.\n\nIn honor of the toddler\u2019s big day, we rounded up all the times Princess P made us feel inferior \u2013 because, after all, it\u2019s Penelope\u2019s world and we all just live in it.\n\nWhen She Flawlessly Posed for a Photo Without Actually Posing\n\nShe makes it look easy.\n\nWhen She Took Home the Prize for \u2018Who Wore it Best?\u2019\n\nOh, you know, NBD.\n\nWhen She Made Channeling a Mermaid Look Effortless\n\nHardly a competition.\n\nWhen She Wasn\u2019t So Sure About Her Twinning Moment with Aunt KoKo\n\nBut to be honest, it\u2019s almost impossible for Penelope to not look adorable.\n\nWhen She Gave Brother Reign Major Side-eye\n\n\u201cNo shade \u2013 just remember, I\u2019m the boss.\u201d\n\nWhen She Visited Cuba with Her Famous Fam\n\nThey see her rollin\u2019.\n\nWhen She Was Treated to an Epic Breakfast Feast with Mom and Reign\n\nShe needs the fuel to keep posing for photos, obvi.\n\nWhen She Refused to Admit She Was Scared of Heights\n\nBe strong, Penelope. Be. Strong.\n\nWhen She Looked Into Our Souls and Never Let Go\n\nAlso, note the fish gape pose.\n\nWhen She Was Too Sleepy to Be Bothered with an Impromptu Photo Shoot\n\nNot that the 4-year-old is in need of any beauty rest.\n\nWhen She Kept Her Cool While Spending Time with Brother Mason and Grandma Kris\u2019s Boyfriend Corey Gamble\n\nShe squeezed some bonding time into her busy schedule.\n\nWhen She Didn\u2019t Want to Miss a Killer Selfie Op\n\nAnything to get her best angle.\n\nWhen She Just Knew She Looked Chicer Than Her Mermaid Guest\n\n\u201cGirl, please.\u201d\n\nWhen She Took a Page Out of Uncle Kanye West\u2019s Book & Refused to Smile\n\nBecause smiling causes wrinkles.\n\nWhen She Cutely Boasted About Her Dessert at Disney\n\nIt\u2019s almost as sweet as the birthday girl herself.\n\nWhen She Smelled Something Weird But Decided to Still Pose for Her Portrait\n\nLike a true rock star.\n\nWhen She Didn\u2019t Agree with Mom Kourtney\u2019s Instagram Filter Choice\n\n\u201c\u2018Slumber\u2019 all the way, mom.\u201d\n\nWhen She Showed Off Her Cute White Dress on the 4th of July\n\nAnd advised her mom on the proper way to strike a pose.\n\nWhen She Gave \u2018The Rock\u2019 Some Serious Competition in the Brow-raising Department\n\nCan you smell what P is cookin\u2019?\n\nWhen She Made Mason Take Her Around Their Playground Like Royalty\n\n\u201cOut of the way, peasants.\u201d\n\nWhen She Attempted to Pull North Away from All the Uncool People\n\nSo brave.\n\nWhen She Mastered Smizing Before Learning to Form a Proper Sentence\n\na.k.a. the most important life lesson of all.\n\nHappy 4th birthday, Penelope!", "images":
