Each of the members spoke onstage, giving thanks for the honor and telling old stories about the New Jersey band. They all hugged as a group afterward.\n\nJon Bon Jovi, who gave a 20-minute speech onstage, said he has been writing his Rock Hall speech for years.\n\n\u201cSome days I write the \u2018Thank you\u2019 speech, sometimes I write the \u2018(Expletive) you\u2019 speech,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s all about time. It took a lot of people to get us here tonight.\u201d\n\nThey were inducted by Howard Stern, who provided many laughs at the event. He even sang some of \u201cWanted Dead or Alive,\u201d getting the audience to join in.\n\nStern joked about Rock Hall co-founder Jann Wenner, questioning why he was qualified to vote on who enters the prominent organization. Stern said Wenner, who founded Rolling Stone magazine, doesn\u2019t play any instruments \u201cbut he did start a great magazine \u2026 and now it\u2019s the size of a pamphlet.\u201d\n\nStern also thanked Bon Jovi for its music, which he is a big fan of, and stressed how big of a deal it is that the band has sold more than 130 million albums.\n\nThe 33rd annual Rock Hall four-hour plus ceremony kicked off with a tribute to Tom Petty, who died in October at age 66. The Killers earned a loud applause from the audience when they started performing \u201cAmerican Girl,\u201d then transitioning to \u201cFree Fallin\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cPay some rock \u2018n\u2019 roll respect \u2026 to the eternal Tom Petty,\u201d frontman Brandon Flowers said, as photos of Petty were displayed in the background.\n\nLater in the event, Ann Wilson of Heart and Jerry Cantrell honored Chris Cornell with a commanding rendition Soundgarden\u2019s \u201cBlack Hole Sun.\u201d Cornell hanged himself in a Detroit hotel hours after a Soundgarden concert there last May.\n\nJustin Hayward, Graeme Edge, John Lodge, members of the Moody Blues, answer questions before the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, Saturday, April 14, 2018, in Cleveland.\n\nThe Cars and four first-time nominees, including Nina Simone, Dire Straits, The Moody Blues and Sister Rosetta Tharpe, make up the 2018 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame class.\n\nSimone received a passionate and show-stopping tribute from groundbreaking performers who she has deeply inspired, from Lauryn Hill to Mary J. Blige.\n\nHill was exceptional, stretching her voice as wide as possible, and singing in French, in honor of Simone\u2019s music. Hill earned a standing ovation from the audience.\n\nGrammy-nominated R&B singer Andra Day was also extraordinary, hitting high notes that also earned her applause. Blige inducted Simone, calling the singer \u201cbold, strong, feisty and fearless.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer voice was so distinctive and powerful and I never heard anything like it,\u201d the R&B superstar said.\n\nSimone, who died in 2003, was a leader in pushing for civil rights and influenced everyone from Aretha Franklin to Alicia Keys. Her brother, Sam Waymon, accepted the induction on his sister\u2019s behalf.\n\n\u201cThey said I had three minutes, I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t.\u2019 I\u2019m going to take the time necessary to say what I got to say,\u201d Waymon said.\n\nWaymon said sharp words during his speech, including lines like, \u201cTo all the brothers out there, protect your sisters. He said he always protected Simone, and continues to do so.\n\nHe also told the crowd, \u201cIf you\u2019re sampling (Nina\u2019s) music, you better pay for it!\u201d\n\nRock Hall voters have recently opened their hearts to progressive rockers, which benefited \u201cNights in White Satin\u201d singers The Moody Blues, the last act to be inducted Saturday.\n\nWilson of Heart said the English rockers \u201care and have always been a kick ass rock band.\u201d\n\nAnother English band, Dire Straits, was inducted at the event, but it was without its leader Mark Knopfler, or his brother David Knopfler. In an interview ahead of the event, co-founding member and bassist John Illsley said Mark \u201cjust didn\u2019t feel like coming, it\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d\n\nOnstage, Illsley said of Mark\u2019s absence: \u201cI\u2019ll assure you it\u2019s a personal thing. Let\u2019s just leave it at that.\u201d\n\nIllsley thanked the entire band and described the group as \u201ca collective, a brotherhood.\u201d There was no performance following the band members\u2019 speeches.\n\nA flawless Brittany Howard, of the critically acclaimed rock act Alabama Shakes, gave an extraordinary Tharpe impression onstage, winning over the audience with her rousing live performance in honor of the godmother of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll. Howard was backed by an equally appealing Questlove of The Roots on the drums. Felicia Collins, best known has a member of the band on \u201cLate Show with David Letterman,\u201d also wowed the audience when she performed a tribute to Tharpe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been long overdue. I\u2019m honored to induct Sister Rosetta Tharpe into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame,\u201d Howard yelled following a video package featuring past interviews from Johnny Cash, Aretha Franklin and others praising Tharpe\u2019s musicality.\n\nTharpe died in 1973 and was a pioneering guitarist who performed gospel music. She earned the \u201cAward for Early Influence\u201d on Saturday, while the other five acts were inducted as performers.\n\nFlowers of the Killers, who has covered The Cars\u2019 songs at his live shows, was ecstatic and energetic as he inducted the band into the Rock Hall, even getting on his knee to hand the members their award as they walked onstage.\n\nInductee Ric Ocasek of The Cars speaks during the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony, Saturday, April 14, 2018, in Cleveland.\n\nThe Cars, founded in Boston in 1976 and known for combining New Wave and classic rock sounds, were inducted this year after being nominated twice before. Ric Ocasek paid tribute to bandmate Benjamin Orr, who died in 2000.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s quite strange to be here without him,\u201d Ocasek said.\n\nElliot Easton also was emotional at the end of his speech when he thanked his mom, who he said was watching from above.\n\n\u201cWe did it mom!,\u201d he said, earning cheers from the audience.\n\nOcasek also earned applause when he namedropped Cleveland: \u201cI lived in Cleveland for a while. It was actually the first place I played music in front of people.\u201d\n\nThe 2018 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony will air May 5 on HBO and will also be heard on SiriusXM Radio.\n\n.galleries:after {\n\ncontent: \u201d;\n\ndisplay: block;\n\nbackground-color: #144A7C;\n\nmargin: 16px auto 0;\n\nheight: 5px;\n\nwidth: 100px;\n\n}\n\n.galleries:before {\n\ncontent: \u201cEntertainment Photos and Video\u201d;\n\ndisplay: block;\n\nfont: 700 20px Georgia,serif;\n\ntext-align: center;\n\ncolor: #1e1e1e;\n\nvar playlist = \u2018chi_ent_movie_trailers\u2019,\n\nlayout = \u2018autoblurb\u2019,\n\niu = \u2018%2F4011%2Ftrb.chicagotribune%2Fent\u2019;\n\nWatch the latest movie trailers.", "images": ["https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2560px-Chicago_Tribune_Logo.svg-1.png", "data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/04/15/2M5VNZTFGZFHPHID34WVXAOYMI.jpg?w=1024&h=670"], "top_img": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/04/15/2M5VNZTFGZFHPHID34WVXAOYMI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Associated Press"], "canonical_link": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2018/04/15/bon-jovi-reunites-as-band-enters-rock-hall-of-fame-alongside-cars-nina-simone-dire-straits-moody-blues/", "title": "Bon Jovi reunites as band enters Rock Hall of Fame \u2014 alongside Cars, Nina Simone, Dire Straits, Moody Blues", "meta_data": {"application-name": "chicagotribune", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Associated Press", "canonical": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2018/04/15/bon-jovi-reunites-as-band-enters-rock-hall-of-fame-alongside-cars-nina-simone-dire-straits-moody-blues/"}, "description": "Bon Jovi reunited onstage with former members for a powerful performance celebrating its admission into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and the late icon Nina Simone was welcomed to the prestigious music club with show-stopping performances from Lauryn Hill and Andra Day.
