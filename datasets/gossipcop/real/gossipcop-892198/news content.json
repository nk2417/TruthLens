It covers entertainment, crowds, food, free things to do, decorations, tips & tricks. Plus, what\u2019s new & returning for the holiday season, dates & details.\n\nChristmas is officially underway at Walt Disney World! The holiday season kicked off on November 14th and ends on December 31, 2025. There are several exceptions to these dates, most notably with both Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party and Disney Jollywood Nights, which began a full week earlier. On the other hand, EPCOT\u2019s Festival of the Holidays runs from November 28 through December 30, 2025.\n\nThis guide shares official details about Christmas at Walt Disney World, strategy, tips & tricks, and more\u2013all based on our firsthand experiences over the course of the last two decades of visiting during the holiday season. If you want to be notified when we share new planning posts for Christmas or other Walt Disney World news, subscribe to our FREE email newsletter!\n\nThe most common question we get about the holiday season is When Does Walt Disney World Decorate for Christmas? That\u2019s not particularly relevant with festivities already underway, but for future reference, you\u2019ll start hearing the sounds and seeing the sights of Christmas from late October through early January 2026.\n\nThe Christmas 2025 season started a full week later than normal, on November 14th. Even so, Christmas unofficially began consistent with its normal schedule. The first Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party at Magic Kingdom was held on Friday, November 7th. The day after that (Saturday, November 8) was the first Jollywood Nights Christmas Party at Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios.\n\nEven before all of that, the parks were getting decorated. Magic Kingdom was fully decorated by November 3rd, with Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios and Animal Kingdom getting decked out in the few days that followed. Again, EPCOT is the only exception. If you\u2019re already planning ahead for Christmas 2026, you can expect the holiday season to follow this same cadence, regardless of whether the season as a whole begins on November 13, 2026, the Friday before, or some random date in between.\n\nUnofficially, this year\u2019s festivities will wind down the first week of January 2026, with Walt Disney World Marathon Weekend (January 7-11, 2026) being when the festivities wrap up and decorations start coming down. Before that, most substantive holiday offerings will end on December 31, 2025.\n\nFor reference, last year\u2019s decorations didn\u2019t come down until January 15th in Magic Kingdom. This is slightly later than normal, but it\u2019s due to the WDW Marathon occurring almost a full week late. Next year, we\u2019d expect decorations to come down a tad earlier.\n\nWith that out of the way, here\u2019s everything you need to know about Christmas 2025 at Walt Disney World. We visited over Jersey Week and Veterans Day, and have already experienced this year\u2019s offering (yet again, minus the 2025 EPCOT Festival of the Holidays, which doesn\u2019t start until Black Friday).\n\nWhat\u2019s New for Christmas at Disney World\n\nLet\u2019s start with Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios, where Disney Jollywood Nights returns for its third season from November 8 through December 22, 2025. The party was much-improved last year and we thoroughly enjoyed it\u2013after having an awful experience year one. However, tickets still didn\u2019t sell well, with only a handful of sold out dates.\n\nObviously, Disney Jollywood Nights is not new\u2013but there are a handful of changes and additions to it for 2025. Here\u2019s the list per Walt Disney World (fair warning\u2013it\u2019s underwhelming):\n\nMeet Miguel at Holiday Fiesta en la Calle in a new location near Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith (my photo above is from DCA, not DHS)\n\nMeet Bing Bong and Partysaurus Rex\n\nEnter the park earlier than before, at 5:30 p.m. before Jollywood Nights starts\n\nEnjoy two new shows, \u201cThe Little Mermaid \u2013 A Musical Adventure\u201d and \u201cDisney Villains: Unfairly Ever After\u201d\n\nSnack on the new Backlot Express Restaurant specialty menu (replacing PizzeRizzo, which is now closed for Monstropolis construction)\n\nNew Jollywood Nights merchandise collection\n\nThat\u2019s it. There were also some tweaks made to Glisten, the ice skating show that debuted last year. Otherwise, it\u2019s pretty much the same. Be sure to check out our 2025 Guide to Disney Jollywood Nights Christmas Party at Hollywood Studios for full details, dates, ticket prices, and more than a little commentary!\n\nDisney\u2019s Hollywood Studios also has some under-the-radar new holiday offerings:\n\nJuggling Elves with Donald Duck \u2013 The Record Setters are a pair of jugglers who perform between Center Stage and Dockside Diner near Echo Lake. These holiday helpers deliver festive cheer with a side of shenanigans as they show off their skills of juggling, comedy and more!\n\nThe Record Setters appear now through December 22, 2025, with performances every Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Friday and Saturday. Showtimes are at 10:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 12:00 noon, 1:30 PM, 2:30 PM and 3:30 PM.\n\nHoliday Spirit Band with Chip \u2018n\u2019 Dale \u2013 Hollygroove Swingin\u2019 is a dynamic brass group will make everyone in your party want to join in the fun and stroll into Santa\u2019s good graces. This group also performs in Echo Lake near Dockside Diner, from now through December 21, 2025.\n\nHollgroove Swingin\u2019 performs every Sunday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 10:30 AM, 11:30 AM, 12:30 PM, 2:00 PM, 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM. Last year, there was another group called \u201cSeasons Jukebox\u201d in the rotation, but they\u2019ve yet to appear in 2025.\n\nFor old school Disney fans, one of the more intriguing additions is the Christmas exhibits at Walt Disney Presents. There\u2019s a new display featuring artifacts from heartwarming holiday films, including \u201cThe Santa Clause,\u201d \u201cDisney Noelle,\u201d \u201cBabes in Toyland,\u201d and \u201cThe Muppets Christmas Carol.\u201d\n\nGuests can also catch a screening of a special holiday collection of Walt Disney animated short films, including \u201cOn Ice,\u201d \u201cPluto\u2019s Christmas Tree,\u201d and \u201cThe Art of Skiing.\u201d\n\nTurning to Magic Kingdom, there\u2019s the 2025 Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party (MVMCP), which will be held several nights per week from now through December 21, 2025.\n\nWe attended the first MVMCP of the season, taking our toddler for the first time. We\u2019ll have a full photo report and recap first that\u2019ll answer whether Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party is still \u201cworth it,\u201d but honestly, that question isn\u2019t all that relevant until 2026, as the hard ticket event is almost entirely sold out for the season.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the EPCOT Festival of the Holidays, which is highlighted by the 2025 Candlelight Processional. There are a ton of new celebrity narrators for this year, including Henry Winkler. There\u2019s also the Behind the Seeds Christmas Tour and a Gingerbread Spaceship Earth in CommuniCore Hall, but those both debuted last year.\n\nIf you\u2019re noticing that a lot of the things that are \u201cnew\u201d for Christmas 2025 actually debuted last year, that\u2019s because there isn\u2019t a whole lot that\u2019s brand new for this year. The Walt Disney Presents exhibit and a few minor changes to existing entertainment is really about it, unfortunately. Walt Disney World is long overdue for a refresh to its holiday offerings.\n\nThroughout this guide, we\u2019ll provide our tips and tricks for best-experiencing the Walt Disney World at Christmas-time. This offers helpful advice for everyone from first-time guests to yearly visitors. It covers everything from holiday highlights to hidden gems.\n\nThis isn\u2019t merely regurgitated press releases and generic info about Christmas at WDW. Instead, we provide a frank assessment of things and insight so you be best prepared to have a great time during the holidays\u2013including what\u2019s still missing as compared to a normal Christmas at Walt Disney World.\n\nWith that out of the way, here\u2019s everything you need to know about Christmas at Walt Disney World. We\u2019ll keep you posted about what, if anything, changes or is added as more announcements are (hopefully) made\u2026\n\nWhen to Visit WDW at Christmas\n\nNovember and December are roller coaster months for crowds, with the weeks around holidays (Veterans Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Eve) seeing elevated attendance and other weeks being more moderate. Accordingly, much of November and December 2025 will have elevated crowd levels due to those holidays and school breaks.\n\nHowever, there will be pockets of low crowd weeks that are \u2018sweet spots\u2019 for holiday time trips. Basically, these two months have very high highs\u2013but also some lows. Check out our list of the 10 Best and 10 Worst Weeks to Visit Walt Disney World in 2025 & 2026. That includes several weeks in November and December. In fact, most weeks make one of those lists or the other!\n\nYou can also read more about crowd forecasts in our November 2025 Walt Disney World Crowd Calendar and December 2025 Walt Disney World Crowd Calendar. (Frankly, the best & worst weeks list is a more useful resource, though!)\n\nOn New Year\u2019s Eve, there\u2019s typically special entertainment at the Magic Kingdom, Epcot, and Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios. If you are thinking of visiting for the week between Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eve, we highly recommend reading our Tips for Visiting Walt Disney World at New Year\u2019s to avoid crowds and have a better experience.\n\nBesides the crowds, there are a few other downsides to visiting during these two weeks. First is the room rates for on property hotels. The second is holiday surcharges at buffets and some other restaurants around property. Definitely keep these costs in mind if you\u2019re approaching this from the perspective of savings.\n\nTo avoid blowing your vacation budget, it\u2019s important to pack for the colder weather. This might seem like a silly recommendation, and one unrelated to saving money, but it\u2019s not. Check out our Winter Packing Tips for Disney post for more insight on what to take on your trip. Just because it\u2019s Florida doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be cold! You don\u2019t want to waste money buying a bunch of $60 sweatshirts from the gift shops because you only packed shorts and t-shirts. (Ask me how I know this!)\n\nAnother way you can save money is by not purchasing Christmas gifts while at Walt Disney World. This is so tempting, and something we have done too many times (it\u2019s Disney\u2019s favorite time of year because guest spending on merchandise is through the roof!).\n\nInstead, check out our Essential Disney Fan Gift Guide for great, money saving gift ideas for Christmas. You can save a ton of money by buying many of the same (and similar) souvenirs and gifts online instead of in the gift shops!\n\nOkay, now that you know when to visit (or now that I\u2019ve further confused you and made the decision even more complicated), let\u2019s figure out what you should experience. Naturally, we\u2019ll start with where to meet the star of the show, the jolly red elf himself, Santa Claus:\n\nWhere to Meet Santa Claus\n\nGuests can meet Santa Claus at Walt Disney Presents in Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios. This meet & greet is tucked away, making it one of the easier ways to meet Santa during the holiday season. His appearance times are continuous, from 10 am to 5 pm from now until December 24, 2025.\n\nSanta Claus is also back on the patio at Restaurantosaurus at Animal Kingdom for one final year! As the guest of honor at the 76th Annual Dino Institute Holiday Party, Santa\u2019s invited everyone to join him in this festive location. With the countdown to extinction on, Santa Claus will have to appear elsewhere in 2026\u2013because Restaurantosaurus will cease to exist.\n\nOver in Magic Kingdom, Santa Claus appears in Storybook Circus during Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party. This is part of Santa\u2019s Christmas Carnival, which includes crafts, polar bears, and more. Closer to Christmas, you can expect to see Santa during daily operations at Magic Kingdom, too.\n\nNew this year, Santa Claus will move to CommuniCore Hall during the 2025 EPCOT International Festival of the Holidays. Prior to this year, Santa had met in the Odyssey Pavilion. Again, Christmas-time doesn\u2019t kick off until November 28th at EPCOT, so Santa will meet from then until December 24, 2025. Showtimes are likely to be between 10 am and 4 or 5 pm.\n\nBeing the only free place to see Santa Claus at Walt Disney World, the meet & greet at Disney Springs is also the most popular. Because of this, Santa uses a virtual queue. Join via the My Disney Experience app at 9 am, 11 am, 1 pm, 3 pm, or 6 pm. You can only join the queue if you are at Disney Springs; you\u2019ll enter the number of guests meeting Santa upon joining.\n\nChristmas in Magic Kingdom\n\nWe\u2019ll start in the Magic Kingdom, which does the most for Christmas out of all of the Walt Disney World parks. No matter what the other parks do, there\u2019s just something to be said for walking onto Main Street and seeing the \u201ctown\u201d decked out for Christmas, and that grandiose icicle castle beckoning at the end.\n\nLet\u2019s start by taking a tour of Magic Kingdom at Christmas\u2026\n\nMickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party \u2013 This beloved after-hours party in Magic Kingdom is a special event that requires separate admission from your normal park tickets. Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party features all things Christmas, and occurs on select nights throughout November and December 2025.\n\nNormally, there are a few elements of Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party that also happen during daily operations closer to Christmas in Magic Kingdom. The major ones are Mickey\u2019s Once Upon A Christmastime Parade and Minnie\u2019s Wonderful Christmastime Fireworks, discussed below.\n\nFor more information about MVMCP, read our Guide to the 2025 Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party.\n\nMinnie\u2019s Wonderful Christmastime Fireworks \u2013 This show is not to be missed. Minnie\u2019s Wonderful Christmastime Fireworks is a replacement for the Holiday Wishes fireworks show. As the name suggests, this nighttime spectacular is hosted by Minnie Mouse, celebrating the magic of Christmas with medleys of beloved holiday songs.\n\nThe fireworks feature \u201cWonderful Christmas Time\u201d by Paul McCartney and other favorites. Projection mapping also features heavily, with the end result being that Minnie\u2019s Wonderful Christmastime Fireworks evokes heartfelt moments of home and family, and the spirit of the season before an incredible finale. We\u2019d highly recommend consulting our Best Magic Kingdom Fireworks Viewing Locations when it comes to picking a spot for watching Minnie\u2019s Wonderful Christmastime.\n\n\n\nMickey\u2019s Once Upon A Christmastime Parade \u2014 During Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party, this parade is shown twice at night and features excellent lighting, ambiance, and SNOW on Main Street, USA. Mickey\u2019s Once Upon A Christmastime Parade also runs during the daytime in the week leading up to Christmas through New Year\u2019s Eve.\n\nWhile we strongly recommend watching the parade on Main Street for full effect. During the Christmas and New Year\u2019s weeks, you can watch it from anywhere along its route without much of a difference in the experience. The floats are very cute, the music is catchy, and there\u2019s a wide range of Disney and Christmas-y characters featured. It\u2019s a must-see.\n\nMickey\u2019s Most Merriest Celebration Stage Show \u2013 In the days before Christmas, Mickey throws a holiday party and invites all of his friends, who sing Christmas Carols before the show is \u201cis Christmas-wrapped up in one sensational, snowy, show-stopping finale.\u201d\n\nWe love this stage show. It\u2019s heartwarming, endearing, and a bit goofy (lowercase g). Mickey\u2019s Most Merriest Celebration is also incredibly popular, and the viewing area can be frustrating if you\u2019re shorter. During Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party, we recommend watching the last showing of Mickey\u2019s Most Merriest Celebration. Actually, we recommend the same during daily ops, too.\n\nJingle Cruise \u2013 The Jingle Cruise overlay consists of decorations in the show scenes and a special spiel from the skippers, who are \u201chomesick\u201d and wanting to celebrate Christmas. The queue is decorated and the boats receive Christmas-inspired names. While holiday overlays are divisive, we are big fans of the idea here and think Jingle Cruise is generally well done.\n\nThis gets popular during the Christmas season, so prioritizing it in your touring plan can be a good idea (see our 1-Day Magic Kingdom Itinerary for more recommendations). However, we prefer doing Jingle Cruise at night to get the full experience of the Christmas lights turned on.\n\nJingle Cruise is an all-day, every day attraction for regular guests and Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party attendees. Starting in early November, experience this wild attraction wrapped with festive jokes and even more fun memories, something guests of all ages look forward to every single year.\n\nJingle Cruise started on November 3rd and will run through January 1, 2026. (The end date could be unofficially extended. The overlay usually lasts through January 4th or 5th.)\n\n\u201cFrozen Holiday Surprise\u201d \u2013 Magic Kingdom will once again host the \u201cFrozen Holiday Surprise\u201d in front of Cinderella Castle, featuring Elsa, Anna, Olaf, Kristoff and the adorable Snowgies.\n\n\u201cFrozen Holiday Surprise\u201d can be seen during regular park hours and during Mickey\u2019s Very Merry Christmas Party. During this brief stage show, friends from Arendelle ring in the season together and help transform Cinderella Castle into a shimmering crystalized palace \u2013 projections that remain throughout the evening.\n\nWe saw \u201cFrozen Holiday Surprise\u201d a few times last year and it was incredibly underwhelming. I don\u2019t know how they managed to add a stage show component to this and still somehow made the end result worse than the previous projections, but it was quite a feat. The projections at the end are too static.\n\nThe version of the show that was performed with the Cinderella Castle Dream Lights through 2019 was far superior. We still miss the Dream Lights, which were the most spectacular Christmas light display at Walt Disney World. Well, at least once the Lights of Winter at EPCOT and Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights at DHS were retired. It\u2019s sad that the top 3 light displays at Walt Disney World are all now defunct. Christmas is not what it once was.\n\nChristmas at EPCOT\n\n\u201cChristmas\u201d at EPCOT is technically a misnomer, because Walt Disney World\u2019s global theme park celebrates a wide variety of worldwide holidays during the Epcot International Festival of the Holidays\n\nThe EPCOT Festival of the Holidays features marketplace food booths open around World Showcase offering different seasonal snacks from around the globe. You might be tempted to think of this as the \u201cEpcot Food & Wine Festival Lite,\u201d but it\u2019s really so much more.\n\nThe Epcot International Festival of the Holidays will run from Black Friday until December 30, 2025. In addition to food, you\u2019ll also find other entertainment options, decorations, and more around both World Showcase and Future World.\n\nThere you can also pick up maps for Chip and Dale\u2019s Christmas Tree Spree, which is a paid scavenger hunt (akin to the Figment and Ratatouille ones during other festivals at Epcot). Chip and Dale are collecting ornaments for their Christmas tree, and you go around looking for them as they gather ornaments from holiday decorations in each World Showcase pavilion.\n\nCandlelight Processional \u2014 Candlelight Processional is a retelling of the Christmas story by a celebrity narrator, along with a mass choir performing seasonal melodies, and a 50-piece live orchestra. In a normal year, Candlelight Processional runs nightly with performances at 5:00 p.m., 6:45 p.m. and 8:15 p.m. You can find the full lineup of celebrity narrators for the Candlelight Processional and more details by clicking here.\n\nOne tip for Candlelight Processional is to book a dinner package if you\u2019re visiting when one of the popular narrators is in town. They\u2019re not too much of a premium if you were already planning on eating a table service meal, and will save you tons of time. We were there for the second night of Neil Patrick Harris\u2019 run a couple of years ago, and we saw people waiting in line FOUR HOURS before the show.\n\nYour enjoyment of Candlelight Processional will depend on whether you like the traditional Christmas story and choir Christmas music. We love the music, but if you don\u2019t like either, this may not be for you. Although the narrators show some personality, don\u2019t expect Candlelight Processional to be \u201cComedy Hour with Neil Patrick Harris.\u201d It\u2019s not.\n\nHoliday Storytellers \u2013 Throughout World Showcase in Epcot, there are international storytellers (most of whom are that country\u2019s version of Santa Claus) who share traditions and tales from their native country. These Santas and other characters appear dressed in location-appropriate outfits and describe what happens on Christmas Eve and Christmas in their homeland. In addition to the Santas, representatives at the American Adventure describe the celebrations of Kwanzaa and Hanukkah.\n\nThe Storytellers can be hit or miss, and whether you want to spend the time seeing listening to their stories will depend upon your personal preferences. If you are on the fence, we\u2019d recommend starting your tour around the World Showcase in Mexico (instead of Canada) as the most engaging Storytellers are near the beginning of the tour that way. If you don\u2019t enjoy those countries\u2019 Storytellers, chances are that you won\u2019t enjoy any of the rest.\n\nLiving with the Land Glimmering Greenhouses \u2013 In the Land pavilion, you can take a leisurely boat ride through the greenhouses of Living with the Land for a special, sparkling tour. Enjoy a peaceful cruise and view twinkling holiday light displays throughout the greenhouses.\n\nWe absolutely love Living with the Land. It\u2019s one of the Walt Disney World attractions we do the most. We also absolutely love Christmas lights. Put those two things together, and we are squarely the target audience for Living with the Land: Glimmering Greenhouses (previously Merry and Bright Nights).\n\nUnsurprisingly, we absolutely love this overlay. I could go on and on about this, gushing about the calming atmosphere, thoroughness, and understated simplicity of it all. Suffice to say, do not miss Living with the Land: Glimmering Greenhouses!\n\n\u2018Joyful! A Gospel Celebration of the Season\u2019 \u2013 Joyful performs at the front of World Showcase from the end of November until the end of December throughout the day, rotating with other performers on the stage.\n\nIt\u2019s a fun show, actually, it\u2019s surprisingly good, but it\u2019s still not an adequate replacement for the gorgeous Lights of Winter that were deemed obsolete a few years ago.\n\nChristmas at Hollywood Studios\n\nSunset Season\u2019s Greetings \u2013 This is a projection show consisting of vignettes from Olaf\u2019s Frozen Adventure, Mickey\u2019s Christmas Carol, the Muppets, and Toy Story, plus appearances by the Prep & Landing characters.\n\nNormally, there are also giant projections on \u201cbillboard\u201d screens around Sunset Boulevard, and synchronized lights on palm trees.\n\nEcho Lake \u201cFlurry of Fun\u201d \u2013 This consists of decorations throughout the area, including the introduction of SANTA GERTIE! There are also oversized Christmas ornaments in Echo Lake, as well as a giant Christmas tree, and other decor.\n\nThere\u2019s also decor on Hollywood and Sunset Boulevards, and the park once again feels appropriately festive for Christmas. It\u2019s all very well done, and a nice addition to Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios this Christmas.\n\nMinnie\u2019s Holiday Dine \u2013 This Christmas-themed character meal at Hollywood & Vine is a ton of fun. Minnie\u2019s Holiday Dine will once again be a buffet and offer character hugs, autographs, high-fives, etc.\n\nWe\u2019ve done this, and shared our thoughts and photos in our Minnie\u2019s Holiday Dine Review.\n\nChristmas at Animal Kingdom\n\nA few years ago, Animal Kingdom upped its holiday game significantly, debuting serious holiday overlays and offerings, with new entertainment and decorations in every single land\u2013including Pandora: World of Avatar.\n\nAll in all, Animal Kingdom is great during the holiday season. Walt Disney World has really enhanced this park\u2019s holiday offerings, and the Merry Menagerie in particular is simple yet pure and awe-inspiring.\n\nTree of Life Holiday Awakenings \u2013 Holiday Edition \u2013 These are projection-mapping vignettes that begin shortly after sunset and continue until park close. The Holiday Awakenings tell a series of winter tales, complete with a familiar and heartwarming holiday-inspired musical score.\n\nNote that there are many evenings in December when Animal Kingdom closes before sunset. Plan accordingly.\n\nDiscovery Island Luminaries \u2013 The epicenter of the yuletide fun is on Discovery Island, where the area is in the midst of a celebration of winter. There are holiday decorations hand-crafted by the eclectic community of artists who make Discovery Island their home, including colorful, animal-inspired luminaries on the rooftops, wireframe bird-shaped lanterns, and themed garland adorning the buildings throughout the land.\n\nThe merriment on Discovery Island continues long into the night. The rooftop luminaries around Discovery Island create a warm and festive glow throughout the entire village, imbuing Discovery Island with a \u2018winter wonderland\u2019 elegance.\n\nMerry Menagerie \u2013 During the day, Discovery Island is alive with a life-size \u201cMerry Menagerie\u201d of artisan-sculpted puppets that include reindeer, foxes, polar bears, penguins, birds, seals\u2014and probably other critters we missed.\n\nThese winter animals are accompanied by serenading live musicians who mingle amongst guests and the Merry Menagerie of critters to create festive atmosphere. Seriously, these puppets are something special. See photos & video, and read more about Merry Menagerie and why we love it so much here!\n\nChristmas at Disney Springs\n\nChristmas Tree Stroll \u2013 This features numerous trees each themed to a different Disney characters (including one dedicated to Mickey & Minnie, The Muppets, Tangled, and more!). Rather than being done as a distinct trail this year, it has returned as the \u201cChristmas Tree Stroll\u201d with spots scattered around Disney Springs.\n\nAside from the beautiful decorations, you can expect some live entertainment, holiday carolers, a street party, photo ops, and Santa Claus.\n\nDuring the Christmas season, Disney Springs is insanely busy on weekends. On busy dates, there can be waits to enter Disney Springs as the complex closes to capacity. We don\u2019t expect that to occur in November or December 2025 because the circumstances are different, but it\u2019ll still be very, very busy.\n\nFor a lot of locals who don\u2019t have Walt Disney World Annual Passes, Disney Springs is a way to enjoy free Christmas entertainment during the holiday season. These locals are most likely to visit on weekends. Add to that the normal mix of tourists, and you have huge crowds.\n\nAs such, we strongly encourage you to visit Disney Springs on a Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. Arrive by 4 p.m. and stay until just after dusk, or arrive really late (after the parks close). Disney Springs will be busiest between 6 and 8 p.m. nightly. For everything else you need to know about making the trip, consult our Tips for Disney Springs at Christmas post.\n\nChristmas at WDW Resort Hotels\n\nHighlights include the Deluxe Resorts but other hotels are spruced up with wreaths and trees decorated with miles of garland, ribbon and glistening ornaments. The biggest draw of all is edible gingerbread houses, which are a staple of certain hotel lobbies during the holiday season. For where those were located last year, see Giant Gingerbread Houses & Displays for Christmas at Disney World.\n\nWe cover the details of each hotel\u2019s display as well as a best plan of attack for visiting the hotels efficiently on our \u201cFree Self-Guided Yuletide Tour\u201d page. Definitely check this out if you want to visit the resorts to see their decorations. This is an itinerary for a single day, so if you\u2019re looking for something longer, check out our 2-Day Yuletide Tour of Walt Disney World. We\u2019ve heard from many readers who found our this to be a highlight of their WDW Christmas vacation!\n\nWe love these WDW Yuletide Tours so much that we do them every single year\u2013sometimes more than once. We\u2019ve had a lot of readers tell us they\u2019ve really enjoyed following the steps of that tour, so we\u2019d highly recommend checking it out, and potentially trying it for yourself!\n\nDeluxe Hotels\n\nSeveral Deluxe Hotels have either a large Christmas tree or a seasonal display that is well worth seeing. The great thing about most deluxe resorts is that they\u2019re in close proximity to one another. You can easily reach the Grand Floridian, Polynesian, and Contemporary from the Magic Kingdom monorail station and Wilderness Lodge via boat.\n\nSimilarly, the Yacht & Beach Club and Boardwalk are easily accessible by foot or boat from Epcot or Disney\u2019s Hollywood Studios. About the only Deluxe that is worth visiting that\u2019s not easily accessible is Animal Kingdom Lodge.\n\nModerate & Value Hotels\n\nThere are some neat decorations at the Moderates and Values, and the decorations are all themed to the specific resort, which is pretty cool. If you have interest in a specific \u201cstyle\u201d of Christmas, you might want to check out a specific resort.\n\nSame goes if you\u2019re a really, really big fan of Christmas decorations. Everyone else probably should bother making trips to the Moderates and Values to see their decorations. While neat, it just isn\u2019t worth the time.\n\nThe one exception to this might be Fort Wilderness. There are some awesome displays put up by long-terms guests on the campground loop. If you have time one afternoon, take a boat over from the Magic Kingdom, have dinner at Trail\u2019s End, and enjoy some of these cool displays.\n\nWe\u2019re already over 5,000 words, so we\u2019ll wrap up this Ultimate Guide to Christmas at Walt Disney World here. Hopefully, it\u2019s everything you need to plan your dream Griswold-style Christmas Vacation to Florida. In case it wasn\u2019t already made clear, we truly love Christmas at Walt Disney World.\n\nThe holiday season is our favorite time of year in Walt Disney World.
