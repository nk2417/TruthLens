This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship,\" the Feb. 15 statement read. \"Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.\"\n\nThe former couple has not yet announced what led to the split.", "images": ["https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/logos/AJC/logo-white.svg?d=2167", "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/QU4EBBQ24NALPA7BSCPTVEFJPQ.jpg?auth=bc2fb9402ed857eb36566c23e325d2a58adc0edbbfa0ce520399b75a9a04d6e4&width=500&height=500&smart=true", "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net%2F06-29-2020%2Ft_3b51435e7ccc452fb61e2dfbddb8d1fa_name_6628971AD16C4E04B51182D71021487F?auth=bf356c954895885b4622c510c74cd3b2d6cb2acf1530eaf3988a9f6c38810b4e&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/icons/search-burger.svg?d=2167", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/logos/AJC/logo-short.svg?d=2167", "https://www.ajc.com/pf/resources/logos/AJC/logo-full-redesign.svg?d=2167", "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/MOSBRF73KVEDHGSEPI4NIU5TRA.jpg?auth=5192ad2fa362f5a990aebad2d8f3cb40d0d3aa983a12c7fc7f6b98ce099a2be5&width=950&height=950&smart=true"], "top_img": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net%2F06-29-2020%2Ft_3b51435e7ccc452fb61e2dfbddb8d1fa_name_6628971AD16C4E04B51182D71021487F?auth=bf356c954895885b4622c510c74cd3b2d6cb2acf1530eaf3988a9f6c38810b4e&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/justin-theroux-breaks-social-media-silence-after-jennifer-aniston-split/SHU14O4y6YiCchuTQmQSUK/", "title": "Justin Theroux breaks social media silence after Jennifer Aniston split", "meta_data": {"description": "The actor\u00a0took to Instagram and shared an adorable photo of himself snuggling with a couple of puppies at the Austin Pets Alive shelter in Austin, Tex", "feedinclude": "true", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The actor\u00a0took to Instagram and shared an adorable photo of himself snuggling with a couple of puppies at the Austin Pets Alive shelter in Austin, Texas.", "image": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net%2F06-29-2020%2Ft_3b51435e7ccc452fb61e2dfbddb8d1fa_name_6628971AD16C4E04B51182D71021487F?auth=bf356c954895885b4622c510c74cd3b2d6cb2acf1530eaf3988a9f6c38810b4e&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "site": "@ajc", "title": "Justin Theroux breaks social media silence after Jennifer Aniston split", "url": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/justin-theroux-breaks-social-media-silence-after-jennifer-aniston-split/SHU14O4y6YiCchuTQmQSUK/"}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"publishtime": "2018-02-27T12:59:14Z"}, "url": "https://www.ajc.com/YQDLQJUYMVA7OCGNCQWZWKA3YA"}, "fb": {"app_id": 366816260017522, "pages": 13310147298}, "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net%2F06-29-2020%2Ft_3b51435e7ccc452fb61e2dfbddb8d1fa_name_6628971AD16C4E04B51182D71021487F?auth=bf356c954895885b4622c510c74cd3b2d6cb2acf1530eaf3988a9f6c38810b4e&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "secure_url": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net%2F06-29-2020%2Ft_3b51435e7ccc452fb61e2dfbddb8d1fa_name_6628971AD16C4E04B51182D71021487F?auth=bf356c954895885b4622c510c74cd3b2d6cb2acf1530eaf3988a9f6c38810b4e&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "type": "image/jpeg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "title": "Justin Theroux breaks social media silence after Jennifer Aniston split", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/justin-theroux-breaks-social-media-silence-after-jennifer-aniston-split/SHU14O4y6YiCchuTQmQSUK/", "description": "The actor\u00a0took to Instagram and shared an adorable photo of himself snuggling with a couple of puppies at the Austin Pets Alive shelter in Austin, Texas.", "site_name": "ajc"}, "thumbnail": "https://www.ajc.com/resizer/v2/https%3A%2F%2Fd1fegwn2wjh0cs.cloudfront.net%2F06-29-2020%2Ft_3b51435e7ccc452fb61e2dfbddb8d1fa_name_6628971AD16C4E04B51182D71021487F?auth=bf356c954895885b4622c510c74cd3b2d6cb2acf1530eaf3988a9f6c38810b4e&width=1200&height=630&smart=true", "language": "English", "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "story.meter": "premium", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=414120752, app-argument=https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/justin-theroux-breaks-social-media-silence-after-jennifer-aniston-split/SHU14O4y6YiCchuTQmQSUK/", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.ajc.com", "summary": ""}
