{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_descendants_of_Queen_Victoria_and_King_Christian_IX", "text": "Royal progeny of Queen Victoria and Christian IX of Denmark\n\nThe royal descendants of Queen Victoria (24 May 1819 \u2013 22 January 1901; r. 1837\u20131901) and of King Christian IX (8 April 1818 \u2013 29 January 1906; r. 1863\u20131906), Monarchs of the United Kingdom and Denmark, respectively, have become members of multiple European royal families. This was partially achieved by the marriage of Victoria's progeny with Christian's (and vice versa). By the time of her Diamond Jubilee in 1897, Victoria was known as the \"Grandmother of Europe\".[1] Christian IX was nicknamed the \"Father-in-law of Europe\".[2]\n\nVictoria and Christian's grandchildren were the monarchs of Denmark, Germany/Prussia, Greece, Norway, Russia and the United Kingdom. Today, the descendants of Victoria and Christian are monarchs of Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.\n\nGrandchildren [ edit ]\n\nChristian IX in 1898 with his and Queen Victoria's mutual great-grandson Prince Edward of York, later Edward VIII [ a ]\n\nVictoria arranged the marriage of her eldest son and heir, the future King Edward VII, to Princess Alexandra of Denmark, the daughter of Christian IX, which took place on 10 March 1863. Among Edward and Alexandra's six children were King George V and his sister Maud.[1] Maud would later marry her cousin, the future King Haakon VII of Norway, in 1896.[b][8]\n\nA son of Christian and brother of Alexandra, Prince William, became King of the Hellenes as George I in 1863 because of his connection with the British royal family.[9] On 27 October 1889, George's son, later Constantine I of Greece, married Princess Sophia of Prussia.[c][9]\n\nAnother daughter of Christian IX, Princess Dagmar of Denmark, married the future Emperor Alexander III of Russia[11] in October 1866,[12] taking the religious name Maria Feodorovna.[11] Between 1881 and 1894, Maria's husband ruled as Russia's sovereign.[12] Her son, Nicholas II, became Emperor of Russia upon Alexander III's death.[11] Nicholas married Princess Alix of Hesse and by Rhine, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, on 26 November 1894, and Alix became his consort, adopting the name Alexandra Feodorovna.[11]\n\nOther grandchildren of either or both of Victoria and Christian were sovereigns suo jure or consorts of sovereigns, including:\n\nWorld War I [ edit ]\n\nAt the start of World War I, which lasted from 1914 to 1918, six major powers of Europe were divided between two coalitions. On one hand, France, Russia and the United Kingdom formed the Triple Entente. On the other hand, Austria-Hungary, Germany and Italy formed the Triple Alliance.[18] During this conflict, George V was King of the United Kingdom.[1] In addition, during World War I, Nicholas II was Emperor of Russia,[19] and Wilhelm II was the German emperor.[20]\n\nHistorian Margaret MacMillan has remarked on the close connection between George, Nicholas and Wilhelm. Namely, George's father and Wilhelm's mother were siblings, making George and Wilhelm first cousins.[e] Additionally, George's mother and Nicholas's mother were sisters from the Danish royal family, making George and Nicholas first cousins.[f][23]\n\nLater descendants [ edit ]\n\nThere are seven current reigning monarchs in Europe who are descended from either Victoria or Christian IX or both. In 2004, while touring Tatoi Palace and the Greek royal cemetery, Queen Anne-Marie of Greece commented of the royals' relations, \"So you see, everybody comes from two sides \u2014 Denmark, King Christian IX, and Britain, Queen Victoria \u2014 and they all sort of criss crossed, I mean us too!\" Anne-Marie is a descendant of both Victoria and Christian IX, as was her husband, Constantine II of Greece.[24]\n\nContemporary monarchs [ edit ]\n\nMultiple reigning European monarchs are descended from Victoria or Christian IX:\n\nMonarchs descended from Queen Victoria [ edit ]\n\nMonarchs descended from King Christian IX [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nJohn William Friso \u2013 the most recent common ancestor of all European monarchs that have reigned from World War II till 2022\n\nLouis IX, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt \u2013 the most common recent ancestor of all current European monarchs from 2022\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nCitations [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Flag_of_Germany_%281867%E2%80%931918%29.svg/40px-Flag_of_Germany_%281867%E2%80%931918%29.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Wikidata-logo.svg/40px-Wikidata-logo.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/40px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/20px-P_vip.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/ChristianIX_e_eduardo_de_york.jpg/250px-ChristianIX_e_eduardo_de_york.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Flag_of_Romania.svg/40px-Flag_of_Romania.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/William_Powell_Frith_-_The_Marriage_of_the_Prince_of_Wales%2C_10_March_1863.JPG/1200px-William_Powell_Frith_-_The_Marriage_of_the_Prince_of_Wales%2C_10_March_1863.JPG", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Imperial_Crown_Heraldry.svg/20px-Imperial_Crown_Heraldry.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/9a/Flag_of_Spain.svg/40px-Flag_of_Spain.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/William_Powell_Frith_-_The_Marriage_of_the_Prince_of_Wales%2C_10_March_1863.JPG/250px-William_Powell_Frith_-_The_Marriage_of_the_Prince_of_Wales%2C_10_March_1863.JPG", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9a/Klepsydra-pt.svg/20px-Klepsydra-pt.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/ae/Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg/40px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f3/Flag_of_Russia.svg/40px-Flag_of_Russia.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Flag_of_Norway.svg/40px-Flag_of_Norway.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Flag_of_Denmark.svg/20px-Flag_of_Denmark.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Flag_of_Greece_%281822-1978%29.svg/40px-Flag_of_Greece_%281822-1978%29.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/William_Powell_Frith_-_The_Marriage_of_the_Prince_of_Wales%2C_10_March_1863.JPG/1200px-William_Powell_Frith_-_The_Marriage_of_the_Prince_of_Wales%2C_10_March_1863.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_descendants_of_Queen_Victoria_and_of_King_Christian_IX", "title": "Royal descendants of Queen Victoria and of King Christian IX", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/William_Powell_Frith_-_The_Marriage_of_the_Prince_of_Wales%2C_10_March_1863.JPG/1200px-William_Powell_Frith_-_The_Marriage_of_the_Prince_of_Wales%2C_10_March_1863.JPG", "width": 1200, "height": 858}, "title": "Royal descendants of Queen Victoria and of King Christian IX - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
