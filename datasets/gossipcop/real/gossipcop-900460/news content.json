That\u2019s right, strapless and sequined all-over, the epic frock came covered in galactic glittering stars.\n\nOf course, like most trends it may come as no coincidence that intergalactic motifs were first spotted on the runways of the Autumn Winter 2017 fashion shows.\n\nopen image in gallery Flounced Dress, \u00a324.99, H&M\n\nChanel staged its show around a double C-branded spacecraft that even had a mock liftoff, as well as astronaut prints, sparkly lunar boots and metallic space blankets.\n\nDior\u2019s Maria Grazia Chiuri also explored constellations as an extension of her couture collection, with evening gowns emblazoned with phases of the moon, golden colours and cosmic elements scattered on sweaters.\n\nopen image in gallery Rose gold Starburst Short Drop Earrings, \u00a315, Accessorize\n\nA trend that proves entirely wearable in real life, if the thought of donning spacecraft-inspired garb is all a bit too Rebel Alliance for your liking, then there\u2019s always jewellery.\n\nInstead, star spangle your accessories with zodiac trinkets from Astley Clarke, twinkling jewels from Diane Kordas \u2013 or, if you\u2019re on a budget, high street stores such as Topshop and Accessorize promise to light up your complexion.\n\nopen image in gallery Star Embellished Clutch Bag, \u00a314, George at Asda\n\nopen image in gallery Star and Moon Print Frill Top,
