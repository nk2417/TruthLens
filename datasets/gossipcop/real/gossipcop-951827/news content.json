I have great admiration and love for the trans community and am grateful that the conversation regarding inclusivity in Hollywood continues. According to GLAAD, LGBTQ+ characters dropped 40% in 2017 from the previous year, with no representation of trans characters in any major studio release.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile I would have loved the opportunity to bring Dante\u2019s story and transition to life, I understand why many feel he should be portrayed by a transgender person, and I am thankful that this casting debate, albeit controversial, has sparked a larger conversation about diversity and representation in film,\u201d the statement continues. \u201cI believe that all artists should be considered equally and fairly. My production company, These Pictures, actively pursues projects that both entertain and push boundaries. We look forward to working with every community to bring these most poignant and important stories to audiences worldwide.\u201d\n\nNew Regency won an auction for the movie on July 2, and it was set to be directed by Rupert Sanders, who previously worked with Johansson on \u201cGhost in the Shell.\u201d\n\n\u201cRub and Tug\u201d focused on Dante \u201cTex\u201d Gill, a crime kingpin who used his massage parlor as a front for prostitution in the \u201970s and \u201980s. Gill lived his life as a trans man, which led many on social media to wonder why a trans actor wasn\u2019t tapped for the role.\n\n\u201cOh word?? So you can continue to play us but we can\u2019t play y\u2019all?\u201d Trace Lysette, a transgender actress best known for appearing on Amazon\u2019s \u201cTransparent,\u201d wrote on Twitter after the casting announcement. \u201cHollywood is so f\u2014ed\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be as upset if I was getting in the same rooms as Jennifer Lawrence and Scarlett for cis roles, but we know that\u2019s not the case. A mess.\u201d\n\n\u201cActors who are trans never even get to audition FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN ROLES OF TRANS CHARACTERS,\u201d tweeted Jamie Clayton, another transgender actress known for her role on \u201cSense8.\u201d \u201cTHATS THE REAL ISSUE. WE CANT EVEN GET IN THE ROOM. Cast actors WHO ARE TRANS as NON TRANS CHARACTERS. I DARE YOU.\u201d\n\nJohansson\u2019s rep previously sent a statement to several media outlets in response to the backlash, which didn\u2019t help to quell the controversy: \u201cTell them that they can be directed to Jeffrey Tambor, Jared Leto, and Felicity Huffman\u2019s reps for comment.\u201d\n\nGLAAD responded to the news with a statement on Friday, celebrating the decision as well as those who spoke out against the casting.\n\n\u201cScarlett Johansson\u2019s announcement, together with the transgender voices who spoke out about this film, are game changers for the future of transgender images in Hollywood,\u201d said GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis. \u201cHollywood changed how Americans understand gay and lesbian lives, and TV is starting to do the same for transgender people with authentic transgender portrayals being major hits with critics and audiences. The film industry has a real opportunity to do the same.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s currently unclear where production stands on \u201cRub and Tug\u201d after Johansson\u2019s exit.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://source.unsplash.com/random/595x333", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/scarlett-johansson.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/scarlett-johansson.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Stedman", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/scarlett-johansson-exit-rub-and-tug-trans-backlash-1202872981/", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Exits Trans Film \u2018Rub and Tug\u2019 Amid Backlash", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Scarlett Johansson has exited \"Rub and Tug\" a little more than a week after her casting sparked backlash amid trans groups and activists.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Alex Stedman", "tags": "Scarlett Johansson", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Exits Trans Film \u2018Rub and Tug\u2019 Amid Backlash", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/scarlett-johansson-exit-rub-and-tug-trans-backlash-1202872981/", "description": "Scarlett Johansson has exited \"Rub and Tug\" a little more than a week after her casting sparked backlash amid trans groups and activists.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/scarlett-johansson.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Scarlett Johansson exits trans movie"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-13T18:11:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-13T22:57:21+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Scarlett Johansson has exited \"Rub and Tug\" a little more than a week after her casting sparked backlash amid trans groups and activists.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@a_sted", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Scarlett Johansson Exits Trans Film \u2018Rub and Tug\u2019 Amid Backlash", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/scarlett-johansson.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531505465.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
