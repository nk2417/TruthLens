Douglas, whose nearly decade-long relationship with Scorsese was coming to an end, was caught off guard. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say at that point,\u201d she told me. \u201cI was, like, \u2018I\u2019m single, yes, no, maybe.\u2019 \u201d She began talking about the script, but Moonves interjected, asking to kiss her. According to Douglas, he said that they didn\u2019t have to tell her manager: \u201cIt\u2019ll just be between you and me. Come on, you\u2019re not some nubile virgin.\u201d\n\nCartoon by Seth Fleishman Copy link to cartoon Copy link to cartoon Shop Shop\n\nAs Douglas attempted to turn the focus back to work, Moonves, she said, grabbed her. \u201cIn a millisecond, he\u2019s got one arm over me, pinning me,\u201d she said. Moonves was \u201cviolently kissing\u201d her, holding her down on the couch with her arms above her head. \u201cWhat it feels like to have someone hold you down\u2014you can\u2019t breathe, you can\u2019t move,\u201d she said. \u201cThe physicality of it was horrendous.\u201d She recalled lying limp and unresponsive beneath him. \u201cYou sort of black out,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou think, How long is this going to go on? I was just looking at this nice picture of his family and his kids. I couldn\u2019t get him off me.\u201d She said it was only when Moonves, aroused, pulled up her skirt and began to thrust against her that her fear overcame her paralysis. She told herself that she had to do something to stop him. \u201cAt that point, you\u2019re a trapped animal,\u201d she told me. \u201cYour life is flashing before your eyes.\u201d Moonves, in what Douglas assumed was an effort to be seductive, paused and asked, \u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d Douglas told me, \u201cMy decision was to get out of it by joking my way out, so he feels flattered.\u201d Thinking that reminding Moonves that he was her boss might discourage him, she told him, \u201cYes, for the head of a network you\u2019re some good kisser.\u201d Moonves frowned and got up. She scrambled to find her briefcase. \u201cWell, this has been great. Thanks,\u201d she recalled saying, moving toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go now.\u201d\n\nMoonves, she said, followed her to the door and blocked her path. He backed her up to the wall, pressing against her, with his face close to hers. \u201cIt was physically scary,\u201d Douglas told me. \u201cHe says, \u2018We\u2019re going to keep this between you and me, right?\u2019 \u201d Attempting to put him off with a joke, she replied, \u201cNo, sir, we won\u2019t tell anyone that you\u2019re a good kisser.\u201d Moonves released her and, without looking at her, walked away. \u201cIt was so invasive,\u201d she said of the threatening encounter. \u201cIt has stayed with me the rest of my life, that terror.\u201d\n\nOutside Moonves\u2019s office, she began to cry. \u201cMy skirt is all twisted,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI\u2019m standing in the hall and I thought of his family.\u201d Moonves\u2019s assistant, sitting nearby, asked whether her parking needed to be validated. Douglas told me, \u201cI remember thinking, Does she know? Does this happen all the time?\u201d\n\nIn her car, Douglas said, \u201cI lost it. I felt sick.\u201d Prophet, her manager, called and, as Douglas worked up the nerve to tell her what had happened, Prophet said that she had just got off the phone with Moonves. He\u2019d said that he and Douglas had a great meeting and \u201chad a lot of fun.\u201d Douglas told me, \u201cI thought, Oh, my God, he\u2019s covered his tracks.\u201d In that moment, she said, \u201cI decided, just bury it.\u201d Later that day, Douglas returned to the house she was renting and told a friend who was staying with her, the actor Craig Chester, about the incident. \u201cShe was trying not to cry, but her voice was shaking. I\u2019ve never seen her that emotional before,\u201d Chester recalled. \u201cShe said that he got on top of her and held her down and she couldn\u2019t get away. If it was any other situation outside business, I would have said, \u2018Let\u2019s go to the cops.\u2019 \u201d But, Chester said, \u201cthere was no talk about going to the police or anything like that, because it was obvious that it would be career suicide.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.newyorker.com/photos/691b8b84eeaa0cd5e47288b3/4:3/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined",
