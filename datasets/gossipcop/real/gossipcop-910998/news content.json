The options are endless!\n\nMichael Tran/FilmMagic\n\nBusy working all day, but still want to show your V-Day spirit? A fitted and stylish colorful suit like Aubrey Plaza's is always great for the boardroom, lunch meeting or presentation.\n\nWhatever work environment you're in, change up the shoes for sleek sneakers, kitten heels or even wedges. Keep the rest of the look to a minimum.\n\nRobin Marchant/Getty Images\n\nReady to celebrate Galentines? Victoria's Secret Angels Romee Strijd and Josephine Skriver have fitting looks for day or night!\n\nStrijd's white dress with red heart prints can be played up with sexy heels and a peek-a-boo red bra or dressed down with sandals or even white sneakers. Meanwhile, Skriver's curve-hugging mini dress can take you from dinner to a night out on the dance floor with your besties.\n\nJB Lacroix/ Getty Images\n\nFor moms who will be stepping out for the night, look to Victoria Beckham. The mother of four is an expert at flawlessly rocking a comfortable and chic outfit wherever she goes. Done are the days of body-hugging and now loose-fitting and classic dresses are in!\n\nPair a maxi, wrap or midi dress with a nice sandal or heel and don't be afraid to let your face show with a messy updo and smoky makeup.\n\nCarlos Alvarez/Getty Images\n\nAnd lastly, dare to be bold like Zendaya by going for a major statement. A strapless silk jumpsuit in your choice of color gives you the courage to take things to a fearless level!\n\nJamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Glamour\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/valentines_day.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-01/mega155505_003.jpg?h=820fff9c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2019-02/1280kourtney.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2019-02/gettyimages-1125962909.jpg?h=fa91eca2&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/valentines_day.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-02/gigi_hadid_gettyimages-924873664.jpg?h=5b2aa3c3&width=256&quality=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/valentines_day.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/gal-gadots-pink-suit-margot-robbies-floral-dress-more-celebrity-inspired-valentine-days-outfits", "title": "Gal Gadot's Pink Suit, Margot Robbie's Floral Dress & More Celebrity-Inspired Valentine Day's Outfits", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/valentines_day.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Look to these stylish celebs for your red, white and pink V-Day looks!", "title": "Gal Gadot's Pink Suit, Margot Robbie's Floral Dress & More Celebrity-Inspired Valentine Day's Outfits", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/gal-gadots-pink-suit-margot-robbies-floral-dress-more-celebrity-inspired-valentine-days-outfits", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Look to these stylish celebs for your red, white and pink V-Day looks!", "twitter": {"description": "Look to these stylish celebs for your red, white and pink V-Day looks!", "title": "Gal Gadot's Pink Suit, Margot Robbie's Floral Dress & More Celebrity-Inspired Valentine Day's Outfits", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/gal-gadots-pink-suit-margot-robbies-floral-dress-more-celebrity-inspired-valentine-days-outfits", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/valentines_day.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Gal Gadot's Pink Suit, Margot Robbie's Floral Dress & More Celebrity-Inspired Valentine Day's Outfits  | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, Shop, News, Gal Gadot, Chrissy Teigen, Celine Dion", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
