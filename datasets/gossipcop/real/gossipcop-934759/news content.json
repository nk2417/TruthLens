We can and should do better.'\n\nKiyoko, who has been nicknamed 'Lesbian Jesus' for her advocacy and art, noted that 'artists who freely express themselves' and 'male and female artists who are opening up more and more about their sexual identities' have her full support.\n\nExuberant: Rita looked to be in a great mood as she entertained the crowd\n\nMaking a statement: Ora described her new song as 'a real gender-fluid freedom record'\n\nCenter-of-attention: The enigmatic artist delved into the crowd of her fans\n\nOra told People on Friday that she feels 'the song is very impactful in its own way,' and 'definitely has a point' to make on a social plane.\n\n'For me, I always looked at this song as a real gender-fluid freedom record. I never looked at it as, \u201cOnly females can listen to it\u201d or \u201cOnly males can listen to it\u201d: It\u2019s for everybody,' said the London native, noting she was inspired by I Kissed a Girl by Katy Perry in coming up with the upbeat single.\n\n'It really represents freedom and the chance to be what you want to be - and there being no judgment and just living your life as you want to live it. That\u2019s what this song represents to me every time I hear it.'\n\nReady to rock: Meanwhile, Rita pulled out all the stops while performing at the O2 Academy in Glasgow on the first night of her tour on Friday night\n\nCrowd pleaser: The Anywhere hitmaker dressed to appeal to her Scottish crowd, donning an all tartan ensemble of yellow and navy mini skirt and matching crop top, showing off her lithe limbs\n\nBeauty: She kept her makeup simple, wearing mascara to make her brown eyes pop and adding a quirky gem to her temple\n\nGolden girl: The 27-year-old songstress styled her blonde tresses in ringlets and wore a pair of golden spectacles on her nose\n\nDazzling: The songstress looked incredible as she performed for the crowd in Scotland\n\nDaring: Rita wore a quirky tartan ensemble for her Scottish fans at the O2 Academy\n\nMeanwhile, Rita pulled out all the stops while performing at the O2 Academy in Glasgow on the first night of her tour on Friday night.\n\nThe Anywhere hitmaker dressed to appeal to her Scottish crowd, donning an all tartan ensemble of yellow and navy mini skirt and matching crop top, showing off her lithe limbs.\n\nRita added a floor length tartan coat which was tied at the waist, made up of a multitude of different coloured fabrics.\n\nThe songstress styled her blonde tresses in ringlets and wore a pair of golden spectacles on her nose.\n\nShe kept her makeup simple, wearing mascara to make her brown eyes pop and adding a quirky gem to her temple.\n\nMeet and greets: After her steller performance, Rita made sure to stop and sign autographs for her adoring fans who waited to catch a glimpse of the star\n\nTime for a selfie!
