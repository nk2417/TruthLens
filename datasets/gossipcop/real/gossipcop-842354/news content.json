Recently, stars Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel discussed the possibility of another Netflix revival, Deadline reports.\n\nThis past November, the streaming service debuted Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\u2014a four-part follow-up to the original WB/CW series. The cast included Graham, Bledel, Kelly Bishop, Scott Patterson, Keiko Agena, Sean Gunn, Matt Czuchry, Milo Ventimiglia, and Yanic Truesdale.\n\nDuring a recent panel, Graham said she doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s a need for more Gilmore Girls:\n\nI love her writing; from the moment I read the pilot, I felt so connected to Amy Sherman-Palladino\u2019s voice as a writer. It was so invigorating and fulfilling to do that work. In terms of an actor, I would never tire of that. Now it has become, \u2018What can we do that is satisfying, and worth continuing, and gratifying to the people who care so much about it.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if there is a need to do more. I would never want it to feel like we overstayed our welcome. \u2026 There\u2019s probably a way to keep these characters alive but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the best thing for them.\u201d\n\nBledel mentioned she isn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d dive back in for another season:\n\nI think for me it comes down to what story we\u2019re telling. I\u2019m just interested in telling a story that is dynamic and that I sort of relate to and can hook into. And if that happens \u2026 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s such an unknown, I don\u2019t think we anticipated that this would happen.\u201d\n\nLater, Bledel revealed the ending of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life was not what she was expecting:\n\nIt certainly wasn\u2019t the ending I was expecting. I told Amy that I hoped Rory would end on a high note. After all her hard work, I wanted to see her succeed and be thriving. So it was a hard thing for me to digest. I was hoping that we would see that she had lived an interesting life and had been fulfilled up until this point where her grandfather dies and [she] comes back home. But, because I know Amy after all these years, I knew it was her true intention and it was something that satisfied her as a writer because she knew the reaction she was going to get from the audience. \u2026 So I trusted her.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think? Are you a fan of Gilmore Girls? Do you think there should be more episodes?", "images": ["https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/twistted-metal-s2-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Kang-English-Teacher-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/quantico09-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/wildcards10-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/alien-earth-season-2-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Below-Deck-renewals-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/gilmore-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lorelai-Luke-gilmore-girls-28847349-1024-768-88x66.png", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/status05-15-590x59.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/scrabble04-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ridiculousness-cancelled-88x66.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=27610379&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/taketwo01-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/wildcards09-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/bmf-s4-b-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/2015-10-16-14.21.09-88x66.png", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Gilmore-Girls-Revival-Featured-04072016-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/039_GILMOREGIRLS_101_SUM_03265R3-590x393.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/plugins/wpdiscuz/assets/img/plugin-icon/icon_info.png", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/2014-02-19-19.53.08-88x66.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-d9rW5j9yWlTO2.gif", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/shutterstock_171690989-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/the-kitchen-88x66.jpeg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/shooter03-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NUP_206548_01238-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/salvation03-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/honest-renovations-season-2-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/027_GILMOREGIRLS_101_WIN_00072R-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Gilmore-Girls-A-Year-in-the-Life-TV-show-revival-on-Netflix-e1468874823502-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/trivialpursuit01-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Dora-and-Teenage-Mutant-Ninja-Turtles-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/026_GILMOREGIRLS_101_WIN_00025R-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/logan_huntzberger-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/gilmore-girls-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/gilmore-girls-alexis-bledel-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/039_GILMOREGIRLS_101_SUM_03265R3-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/themes/tvseriesfinale/images/logo.png", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/shadesofblue06-88x66.jpg", "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/reasonable-doubt-s3b-88x66.jpg"], "top_img": "https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/039_GILMOREGIRLS_101_SUM_03265R3-590x393.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Pena", "Sue Alexander", "Grace Reed", "Reinaldo Cunha"], "canonical_link": "https://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/gilmore-girls-stars-mixed-feelings-another-revival-ending/", "title": "Gilmore Girls: Stars Have Mixed Feelings About Another Revival & the Ending", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Gilmore Girls: Stars Have Mixed Feelings About Another Revival & the Ending", "description": "Will there be more\u00a0Gilmore Girls?
