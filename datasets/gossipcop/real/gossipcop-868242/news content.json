He is great in #Dunkirk. Would like to see him tackle some more serious roles in the future.\u201d\n\nSpeaking with Radio One presenter Nick Grimshaw, the former Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School pupil joked that for Dunkirk he used his experience playing Buzz Lightyear in a school production.\n\nAnd this was was the only previous acting experience he had to draw on to play Alex, a junior soldier desperately trying to get home as enemy forces close in on the beaches.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nContent cannot be displayed without consent\n\nAlso starring in Dunkirk, about the 1940 evacuation of Allied troops from the French shores, are acting heavyweights Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy. And the charismatic Styles more than earns his place at the table, to the extent audiences could easily forget they were watching a popstar up their on the cinema screen.\n\nOne film-goer tweeted after a trip to the cinema: \u201cAnyone realized how Alex from Dunkirk looks exactly like Harry Styles?\u201d\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 11 Images Harry Styles in the film Dunkirk\n\n\u2018Kingsley\u2019 said: \u201cLast 5 mins of #Dunkirk my friend leans over to me and goes \u201cIs that Harry Styles?\u201d\n\nAnd Daniel Reji commented: \u201cHarry Styles had a remarkable debut as an actor in Dunkirk.\u201d\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nIn September Styles will kick off his sold-out world tour after his single Sign of the Times and and self-titled album were released to acclaim with comparisons drawn with Freddy Mercury and David Bowie\u2019s Ziggy Stardust alter-ego. And he can now add \u2018movie star\u2019 to his CV.\n\nHere are other popstars who have made the switch to big screen:\n\nBeyonc\u00e9\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nView 11 Images Beyonce makes movies too (Image: Kevin Winter/WireImage)\n\nQueen Bey makes movies for her own albums these days.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nBut the Work It Out singer had a turn in Austin Powers: Goldmember, which divided the critics, and she shone as Deena in the 2006 film Dreamgirls based on the story of the Supremes which saw Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy win best supporting actress and actor gongs at the Oscars.\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nView 11 Images Michael Jackson was a Wiz on the big screen too (Image: AP Photo/Joerg Sarbach)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nThe King of Pop made a werewolf movie within a zombie film as the epic video for the 80s monster hit Thriller.\n\nAnd he packed devoted fans into cinemas for Moonwalker, which was a collection of short films about Jackson\u2019s life as well an adventure film starring MJ.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nIn 1978 he had a starring role as The Scarecrow in The Wiz, a remake of one of his favourite films The Wizard of Oz co-starring Diana Ross as Dorothy.\n\nJustin Timberlake\n\nView 11 Images (Image: Invision)\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nJT\u2019s albums are pop and R&B perfection. But we have to wait while he heads off to make huge Hollywood films in between making music.\n\nLike Styles, Timberlake is a former boyband member with N\u2019Sync and he has gone on to carve out a hugely successful career as a solo singer and as an actor. He played the romantic lead in Friends With Benefits with Mila Kunis and had a starring role in the Oscar-winning social network.

adaptation of Dick Tracy and captured hearts in the weepy A League of Their Own.\n\nThe True Blue-singing trooper won critical acclaim for her emotionally-charged lead role as Eva Per\u00f3n in the musical biopic Evita.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nBut the 2002 film Swept Away, directed by her ex husband Guy Ritchie, was critically panned.\n\nWhitney Houston\n\nView 11 Images Kevin Costner and Whitney

actress gong for the romantic comedy Moonstruck in 1988.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nShe also gifted us with her role as a wacky mom in Mermaids in 1990 and the amazing Shoop Shoop Song (It\u2019s In His Kiss) which seemed to be number one for an eternity.\n\nMariah Carey\n\nView 11 Images Mariah Carey was almost unrecognisable in Precious\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nMariah played a young singer in the 2001 flop Glitter, alonside Burnage\u2019s finest Max Beesley as DJ Julian \u2018Dice\u2019 Black who helps her in her music career.\n\nBut the Can\u2019t Let Go hitmaker proved her acting worth in the gritty movie Precious and looked totally unlike her usual glamorous self as a makeup-free no-nonsense social worker.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nElvis Presley\n\nView 11 Images Elvis Presley was a king of the movies too\n\nArticle continues below\n\nAs well as being the King of Rock and Roll, ultimate entertainer Elvis made 31 films as an actor, including Love Me Tender, Viva Las Vegas, King Creole, GI Blues and
