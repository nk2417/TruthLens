Kylie Jenner revealed in a Snapchat she shared with followers on Saturday, October 22, how she confused a pig for a chicken in a clip that went viral earlier this month.\n\nJenner, 19, looked calm and collected as she explained to fans why she blurted out, \u201cIs that a chicken?\u201d when she saw her mom, Kris Jenner, holding a baby pig wrapped in a blanket in a deleted scene from Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: See All of Kylie Jenner\u2019s Most Colorful Hairstyles Kylie Jenner is known for changing up her naturally dark hair, dying her tips a rainbow's worth of colors (or trying a new shade with a wig). See her most colorful hairstyles ever here!\n\n\u201cAll right, so everyone keeps tweeting me this one Vine of my mom getting me a pig and I mistake it for a chicken,\u201d she said in the Snapchat clip. \u201cBut here\u2019s the real story behind me thinking that it\u2019s a chicken.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Kylie Jenner Snapchats (@kylizzlesnapchats) on Oct 22, 2016 at 9:05pm PDT\n\nKylie Jenner thinking this pig is a chicken https://t.co/q4qMFMqi6Q \u2014 anouk (@CARL0T0) October 11, 2016\n\n\u201cSo I love chickens, and my mom asked me what I wanted for my housewarming gift, so I told her, \u2018I want chickens, I want a chicken coop, I\u2019m dying to have a chicken,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cWe had, like, over 10 conversations about it, so when I saw her downstairs, I saw something that was all wrapped up in her arms, and I was upstairs, of course I assumed that it was a f\u2011\u2011king chicken. I never asked for a pig.\u201d\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Kylie Jenner\u2019s Best Selfies: A Definitive Ranking Us Weekly rounds up the best Kylie Jenner selfies of all time \u2014 click through to see the definitive ranking\n\nThe makeup maven\u2019s confusion led to some fans creating Vines poking fun at her mistake, including clips of pigs being called chickens, and one in which a little girl can be heard saying in video of pigs in a pen, \u201cLook at all those chickens!\u201d\n\nJenner took the joking in stride and told her followers Saturday, \u201cBut yeah, I just wanted to make the public announcement that I do know the difference between a chicken and a pig, so you guys don\u2019t have to worry. If you don\u2019t know what I\u2019m talking about, then simply ignore all these Snapchats.\u201d\n\nRelated: PHOTOS: Viral Stars: 2016\u2019s Biggest Internet Celebrities Ready, set, spotlight!
