(Kardashians, they\u2019re just like us.)\n\n\u201cIt gets rid of cellulite, you rub it on your body, it\u2019s literally the most painful [thing],\u201d Khloe said. \u201cYou rub this on your body really hard, but you gotta be naked. You should see me naked in my bed doing this. It looks like a very weird sexual thing.\u201d\n\nUp Next: Khloe Kardashian Swears by This Vibrating Tool Before and After Her Workouts\n\n\u201cYou take your jeans off and I\u2019ll do this to you,\u201d Khloe instructed Kourtney.\n\n\u201cGot a thong just for you, Khlo,\u201d Kourtney replied as she willingly stripped down to show off her booty for KUWTK cameras.\n\nKhloe and Cheban lathered Kourtney\u2019s bare assets with lotion, then started rolling away on her butt with the massage tool.\n\n\u201cIt does not hurt whatsoever,\u201d Kourtney said, taking a cheeky dig at Khloe. But her butt massagers (and fans) noticed that the eldest Kardashian didn\u2019t have any cellulite to rub out in the first place.\n\n\u201cYou really have no dimples!\u201d Khloe told her sister. \u201cNo cellulite at all!\u201d Cheban added.\n\nAnd Kardashian fans agreed, praising Kourtney\u2019s full, round butt as the best part of the juicy episode \u2014 and some have even awarded Kourt with the coveted \u201cbest butt\u201d title of all the Kardashian clan.\n\nKourtney kardashian has the nicest booty for those who didn\u2019t watch keeping up tonight \ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d\ud83d\ude0d \u2014 StevesSon\ud83e\udd87 (@zackkBeezy) October 16, 2017\n\n@kourtneykardash be the only natural Kardashian the rest are so made up to be perfect pic.twitter.com/dpbl2rVnDz \u2014 \u263aAndrea\u2665 (@sweetishgurl) October 16, 2017\n\nThese fans mean business if they\u2019re using a KIMOJI (Kim Kardashian\u2019s personal line of emojis) butt to dub Kourtney\u2019s superior.\n\nIn Kourtney\u2019s defense, she\u2019s (metaphorically) been working her butt off for her toned body and slim hourglass figure. The KUWTK sister sticks to a strict diet of whole, organic foods, cutting gluten, dairy and sugar completely, and she\u2019s been stepping up her booty day routine at the gym.\n\nIt\u2019s clearly paying off.\n\nPhoto credit: E!", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/boston-blue-faith-and-family-sonequa-martin-green-donnie-wahlberg-cbs.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/04/45511bc5-8791-4d0b-a2e9-34e9c9011b24.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/70afec6a-3143-4947-b047-428e525611d4.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kelsey Patterson", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/news/kuwtk-kourtney-kardashian-butt-cellulite-massage/", "title": "Watching Khloe Kardashian Massage Kourtney\u2019s Bare Butt Is Too Weird to Handle", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Watching Khloe Kardashian Massage Kourtney's Bare Butt Is Too Weird to Handle", "description": "Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s bare butt made a flashy cameo in Sunday\u2019s episode of Keeping Up with the Kardahians, and fans were loving it.
