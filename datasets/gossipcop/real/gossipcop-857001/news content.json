Shortly after his death, Vicky issued a statement speculating that her husband had suffered an adverse side effect of Ativan, an anxiety medication he took. \u201cWhen we spoke after the show, I noticed he was slurring his words; he was different,\u201d she wrote then. \u201cWhen he told me he may have taken an extra Ativan or two, I contacted security and asked that they check on him. What happened is inexplicable and I am hopeful that further medical reports will provide additional details. I know that he loved our children and he would not hurt them by intentionally taking his own life.\u201d\n\nA note from Vicky\u2019s lawyer, Kirk Pasich, accompanied her statement then, saying that: \u201cChris, a recovering addict, had a prescription for Ativan and may have taken more Ativan than recommended dosages.\u201d Moreover, he said that if Chris had taken his own life, he\u2019d done so unknowingly.\n\nCornell\u2019s family will hold a funeral for the singer on Friday at Los Angeles\u2019 Hollywood Forever cemetery. It is also planning on holding a public memorial, though details for that are not yet public.\n\nRead Vicky Cornell\u2019s full open letter:\n\nTo My Sweet Christopher,\n\nYou were the best father, husband and son-in-law. Your patience, empathy and love always showed through.\n\nYou had always said I saved you, that you wouldn\u2019t be alive if it were not for me. My heart gleamed to see you happy, living and motivated. Excited for life. Doing everything you could to give back. We had the time of our lives in the last decade and I\u2019m sorry, my sweet love, that I did not see what happened to you that night. I\u2019m sorry you were alone, and I know that was not you, my sweet Christopher. Your children know that too, so you can rest in peace.\n\nI\u2019m broken, but I will stand up for you and I will take care of our beautiful babies. I will think of you every minute of every day and I will fight for you. You were right when you said we are soulmates. It has been said that paths that have crossed will cross again, and I know that you will come find me, and I will be here waiting.\n\nI love you more than anyone has ever loved anyone in the history of loving and more than anyone ever will.\n\nTrending Stories Kristen Bell Is the Star of a New Jesus Podcast From Fox.
