We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy.\n\nThis article originally appears in the October 2017 issue of ELLE.\n\n\n\nYou may think that personal style is a wholly subjective gift: You know it when you see it, sure, but when it comes to choosing who does it best...how do you decide? For our annual personal style awards, we took a democratic approach, enlisting 17 style luminaries\u2014designers, actors, industry players, and more\u2014to tell us who\u2019s really got it going on. Here, we bring you the result: 12 genre-smashing sartorial heavyweights whose wardrobes telegraph an eye for beauty, a fearless knack for statement-making, and a deep streak of individuality.\n\n\n\nThe Rebel With a Cause\n\nParis Jackson | Model; Actress\n\nMark Seliger Cotton tank, $490, Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello, at Saint Laurent, NYC. Corduroy pants, Matthew Adams Dolan, $550. Suede leather ankle boots, Christian Louboutin, $1,895. Her own jewelry. Stylist\u2019s own belt.\n\n\u201cI like to stick with earth tones and tie-dye. Stevie Nicks, Janis Joplin, and Jimi Hendrix are my top three fashion icons\u2014they all wore what felt good on them, period. Which I love. Staying true to yourself is important in every aspect, even down to your clothes.\u201d\n\nBeauty Secret: For mussed volume, flip hair upside down and mist with Ultra Fine Hair Spray.\n\nThe Globe-Trotting Glamourist\n\nAurora James | Founder and Creative Director, footwear label Brother Vellies\n\nDaymion Mardel Embellished-Lurex jacquard jacket, Gucci, at select Gucci stores nationwide. Silk georgette dress, Ullta Johnson, $750. Beaver felt and turquoise hat, Nick Fouquet, $1,175. Diamond and rose gold ring, Brother Vellies.\n\n\u201cI love embellishment. A black pump is great, but it\u2019s a lot better when you can have feathers on it and not take yourself so seriously. My fashion sensibility is very eclectic but also multicultural. Traveling really opens your eyes: Well, what does a uniform look like in Indonesia? What does a kimono represent for certain people?\u201d\n\nThe Model of Elegance\n\nCarolyn Murphy | Model\n\nHeather Hazzan Cotton tunic, The Row, $3,690, at The Row, L.A. Her own earrings.\n\n\u201cMy style is definitely influenced by the \u201970s, when I grew up, and by my mother\u2014the lesson from her was just effortlessness: Know what you know, like a great white button-down, a great pair of jeans. I don\u2019t like things that are fussy. For me, a gold hoop or even a red lip is a way to dress something up.\u201d\n\nThe Punk Protagonist\n\nNoah Cyrus | Singer\n\nDaymion Mardel Cotton T-shirt, Raf Simons, $289, rafsimons.com. Mesh top, Creatures of Comfort, $225. Brass and crystal crown, Dolce & Gabbana, $3,875. Mink and gold hoop earrings, Wild and Woolly, $315. Diamond and horn ring, Pascale Monvoisin, $745. Red enamel and diamond ring, Marc Alary, $1,200. Lam\u00e9 herringbone waist bag, Chanel, $3,900. Calfskin boots, Victoria Beckham, $1,995. Her own bracelet.\n\n\u201cI found my look very recently. It kind of came from finding Instagrammers whose style I like. One of my favorites\u2014her handle is @uglyworldwide\u2014shaved her head, shaved her eyebrows. She\u2019s not afraid to be like, \u2018F*** what people think about me.\u2019 I think it should be all about feeling comfortable in your skin.\u201d\n\nBeauty Secret: The ultimate flyaway defense, Keratin Smooth Heat Defense Spray keeps straight styles sleek.\n\nRulebreaker-in-Chief\n\nTracee Ellis Ross | Blackish\n\nDaymion Mardel Leather and suede jacket, Prada, at select Prada boutiques nationwide. Yellow and rose gold and sapphire ring necklace, Monica Rich Kosann, $2,885. Her own vintage T-shirt and C\u00e9line corduroy pants.\n\n\u201cI used to love watching my mom [Diana Ross] get ready to go out for the evening. Glamour and sparkles\u2014the energy of what happened onstage in her full glory\u2014was translated differently when she was going to dinner. That left such an impression, that through clothing you could articulate how you are in the world. Even at work, I come in at five in the morning, I get dressed. There\u2019s always a . I\u2019m not somebody who\u2019s like, \u2018Oops, this is just something I have on.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe Menswear Magician\n\nSophie Auster | Singer-Songwriter\n\nHeather Hazzan Silk jacket, $2,080, trousers, Haider Ackermann, $1,670, both, haiderackermann.com. Vintage T-shirt, Saint Luis, $2,000. Silver earrings, Trademark, $228. Velvet scarf, Echo, $39. Vintage Herm\u00e8s gold circle pendant necklace, Beladora, $1,950. Lapis lazuli, sapphire, diamond, and gold pendant necklace, Retrouva\u00ed, $1,775. Gold and diamond rings, both, Temple St. Clair, $2,950-3,500 each. Gold and diamond multiband ring, Elsa Peretti for Tiffany & Co., $2,000. Leather brogues, Church's, $660. Her own watch.\n\n\u201cThe suit has definitely become a performance uniform for me. When I first adopted the look, it made me feel very powerful and cool, like I could be a better version of myself. It\u2019s funny with clothing: A wispy dress can make you feel more vulnerable, and a very structured coat and pants can make you feel stronger. I like to embrace my strength.\u201d\n\nThe Modern Bombshells\n\nAtlanta de Cadenet Taylor | Model; DJ\n\nAmanda de Cadenet | Photographer; Media Entrepreneur; TV Host, The Conversation\n\nDaymion Mardel On Atlanta de Cadenet Taylor: Leather jacket, Balenciaga, at select Barneys New York stores nationwide. Embroidered-suede dress, Coach, $1,400. Silk head scarf, Rockins, $150. Gold and diamond ring, David Yurman, $2,200. Turquoise cabochon ring, Fox & Bond, $485. Black enamel and gold ring, Marc Alary, $950. Her own earrings and necklaces. On Amanda de Cadenet: Chiffon dress, Alberta Ferretti, collection at barneys.com. Her own earrings and ring.\n\nAtlanta, daughter: \u201cI\u2019m totally not a minimalist. I love color; I love floral prints. I have a body, so I have to highlight my best parts, and one of them is my waist. When I was younger, I envied the \u2018norm,\u2019 the very thin girl. That\u2019s what was in. It\u2019s awesome that it\u2019s changing, and I\u2019m finally learning to accept and love my body.\u201d\n\n[object Object]\n\nThe New Bohemian Singer\n\nKelly Rowland | Singer\n\nDaymion Mardel Lace dress, Ellery, $4,995, ellery.com. Lace bodysuit, Eres, $755. Rose gold, horn, and diamond ring, Pascale Monvoisin $505. Pav\u00e9, onyx, mother-of-pearl, and gold ring, Marc Alary, $4,200. Calfskin boots, Fendi, $1,350. Her own earrings and necklace.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cOne of my first big purchases in the early-2000s Destiny\u2019s Child days was a pair of thigh-high Dolce & Gabbana denim boots. I was 18 or 19, and they made me feel a little more grown-up, a little more sexy. I wore them everywhere: during performances, on tour, on days off. My friend was like, \u2018You\u2019re wearing them too much.\u2019 I said, \u2018Do you know how much money I paid for these boots? They\u2019re going to walk for themselves!\u2019 \u201d\n\nBeauty Secret: A corona of curls gets big-time radiance from Keratin Smooth Shine Serum.\n\nThe California Cool Girl\n\nKate Bosworth | Actress\n\n[object Object]\n\n\u201cI was a late \u201980s and \u201990s kid, so it was all about the Keds and Levi\u2019s. In the \u201990s, I looked to people like Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Hutton. I remember desperately wanting to be a Calvin girl\u2014to me, that\u2019s the epitome of class, a truly stripped-back, pure beauty. My father worked in the fashion industry, and he\u2019d always say, \u2018If you stay classical, you\u2019ll always be timeless.\u2019 You can look at a photograph of Bessette Kennedy wearing jeans and a blue-ish sweater and loafers, and it\u2019s just as relevant today.\u201d\n\nBeauty Secret: To achieve wind-whipped texture, work Beauty-Full Volume Mousse into lengths; massage at the root for major lift.\n\nThe Architecturalist\n\nCasey Legler | Artist\n\n[object Object]\n\n\u201cI moved around a lot as a kid, and very early on, I understood that what you wore that had value in one culture held no value in another culture\u2014there was a relativism that gave me the freedom to actually wear what I wanted. In my closet there are Dickies, a bunch of white T-shirts, black T-shirts, and different kind of socks. I was an architecture student in school, so I appreciate the building of garments and anything that\u2019s classic and simple.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Mix Master\n\nMiranda July | Filmmaker; Writer; Artist\n\nDaymion Mardel Wool-blend jacket, Self-Portrait, $595, collection at shopbop.com. Mesh top, Priscavera, $175. Gold chain, $450, locket, $2,025, both, Tiffany & Co. Wool-blend socks, Maria La Rosa, $57. Leather pumps, Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello, $1,995. Her own bracelet, Atelier Boutique skirt, and vintage Nike T-shirt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt comfortable when I get dressed if there\u2019s something just \u2018off\u2019 enough; I guess that kind of describes my work, too. It doesn\u2019t all come from confidence; it all kind of plays from your unique insecurities and your confidence that makes you, you. It can\u2019t all be bulletproof or it\u2019s just boring.\u201d\n\n[object Object]\n\n[object Object]\n\n|", "images":
