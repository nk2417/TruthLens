After her death in 2014, the franchise continued, but never found new legs. Kathy Griffin, brought on to replace Rivers, left after just seven episodes, tweeting \u201cMy style does not fit with the creative direction of the show.\u201d\n\nGriffin followed by less than a month the exit of show co-host Kelly Osbourne who had been with the show five years and whose exit closely followed outrage over remarks made by another co-host, Giulana Rancic, about Zendaya Coleman\u2019s dreadlocks at that year\u2019s Oscars. Rancic apologized and Osbourne, who had condemned the remarks, accepted the apology but split soon thereafter.\n\nExec producer Melissa Rivers became co-host in 2015, currently joined by Rancic, Brad Goreski, NeNe Leakes and Margaret Cho.\n\nThe swan-song special will look at memorable moments in the life of the franchise, including the \u201cBitch Stole My Look,\u201d \u201cGuess Me From Behind,\u201d and \u201cStarlet or Streetwalker,\u201d segments E! said are fan favorites in this morning\u2019s announcement confirming report first in Variety. The special also will include footage of an unaired \u201980s themed episode with Joan Rivers.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nFashion Police is produced by Wilshire Studios. Melissa Rivers, Lisa Bacon and Gary Snegaroff executive produce.", "images": ["https://s0.wp.com/_si/?t=eyJpbWciOiJodHRwczpcL1wvZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tXC93cC1jb250ZW50XC91cGxvYWRzXC8yMDE5XC8wNFwvY3JvcHBlZC1pY29uLTUxMng1MTIucG5nIiwidHh0IjoiRGVhZGxpbmUiLCJ0ZW1wbGF0ZSI6ImVkZ2UiLCJmb250IjoiIiwiYmxvZ19pZCI6MTc5MjkwMTQ5fQ.IHL7P_bYC7Sr4W2XvHh7kLwSO5arBq8LoHSjTj-l-uAMQ", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://s0.wp.com/_si/?t=eyJpbWciOiJodHRwczpcL1wvZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tXC93cC1jb250ZW50XC91cGxvYWRzXC8yMDE5XC8wNFwvY3JvcHBlZC1pY29uLTUxMng1MTIucG5nIiwidHh0IjoiRGVhZGxpbmUiLCJ0ZW1wbGF0ZSI6ImVkZ2UiLCJmb250IjoiIiwiYmxvZ19pZCI6MTc5MjkwMTQ5fQ.IHL7P_bYC7Sr4W2XvHh7kLwSO5arBq8LoHSjTj-l-uAMQ", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa De Moraes", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2017/10/fashion-police-canceled-joan-rivers-farewell-special-november-27-1202190576/", "title": "E!\u2019s \u2018Fashion Police\u2019 To End With Last Hurrah Special On November 27", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "E!'s long-running Fashion Police franchise will be taken off life support after one last hurrah on Monday, November 27.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Lisa de Moraes", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "E!\u2019s \u2018Fashion Police\u2019 To End With Last Hurrah Special On November 27", "url": "https://deadline.com/2017/10/fashion-police-canceled-joan-rivers-farewell-special-november-27-1202190576/", "description": "E!'s long-running Fashion Police franchise will be taken off life support after one last hurrah on Monday, November 27.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://s0.wp.com/_si/?t=eyJpbWciOiJodHRwczpcL1wvZGVhZGxpbmUuY29tXC93cC1jb250ZW50XC91cGxvYWRzXC8yMDE5XC8wNFwvY3JvcHBlZC1pY29uLTUxMng1MTIucG5nIiwidHh0IjoiRGVhZGxpbmUiLCJ0ZW1wbGF0ZSI6ImVkZ2UiLCJmb250IjoiIiwiYmxvZ19pZCI6MTc5MjkwMTQ5fQ.IHL7P_bYC7Sr4W2XvHh7kLwSO5arBq8LoHSjTj-l-uAMQ", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-18T17:10:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-18T19:01:38+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "E!'s long-running Fashion Police franchise will be taken off life support after one last hurrah on Monday, November 27.", "site": "@Deadline", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "E!\u2019s \u2018Fashion Police\u2019 To End With Last Hurrah Special On November 27"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508346644.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
