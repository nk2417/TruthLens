I'm going to call the Kardashians in for this one.\"\n\nShe previously told the Vogue, \"I can give one solid hour of my life away for the Kardashians.\"\n\nThe actress confessed it was talking to ' Black Swan' director that first sold her on doing the film.\n\nShe shared, \"Before I read a script, when he just pitched my the ideas that were floating around his head they were just so insane, just huge, massive, biblical, in the universe. I'd never heard anything like it.\"\n\nHelmed by Darren Aronofsky, ' Mother!' stars Jennifer Lawrence, Javier Bardem, Ed Harris and Michelle Pfeiffer in pivotal roles.\n\nThe flick is slated to release on 15 September.", "images": ["http://images.catchnews.com/upload/2024/11/25/Michael_Villella_in_The_Slumber_Party_Massacre_254576_300x172.jpg", "https://images.catchnews.com/upload/2022/03/03/vastu_tips_231008_300x172.jpg", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/951714263/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "http://images.catchnews.com/upload/2024/10/03/Ron_254158_300x172.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1611818985800084&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://images.catchnews.com/upload/2017/09/13/Jennifer_Lawrence013_81198_730x419.jpg", "https://static.catchnews.com/en/images/ftr-logo.jpg", "http://images.catchnews.com/upload/2025/10/10/election_Commission_257254_850x550.png", "http://images.catchnews.com/upload/2024/05/28/Jennifer_Lopez_talks_about_AI_254008_300x172.jpg", "https://images.catchnews.com/upload/2022/03/07/Anupam_kher_231145_300x172.jpg", "https://images.catchnews.com/upload/2022/09/17/Untitled_8_239125_300x172.png", "http://wtf2.forkcdn.com/www/delivery/lg.php?bannerid=0&campaignid=0&zoneid=2135&loc=https://www.catchnews.com/hollywood-news/jennifer-lawrence-thanks-kardashians-for-getting-her-through-mother-s-intense-scenes-81198.html", "https://images.catchnews.com/catchnews-2/images/hindi-icon.png", "http://images.catchnews.com/upload/2024/09/10/Rachel_Zoe,_Rodger_Berman_253762_300x172.jpg", "https://images.catchnews.com/catchnews-2/svg/logo.svg", "https://images.catchnews.com/upload/2017/09/13/Jennifer_Lawrence013_81198_730x419-m.jpg", "https://images.catchnews.com/upload/2022/11/03/kapil-mishra_240884_300x172.png", "https://static.catchnews.com/en/svg/comment_icon.svg", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=KQaKl1aE+GW1bm", "http://images.catchnews.com/upload/2025/11/20/Ayodhya_257314_1600x1200.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=18075250&cv=2.0&cj=1", "http://static.catchnews.com/en/images/LittleStar.png", "http://images.catchnews.com/upload/2025/11/17/Bobby_Deol_and_Aaditi_Pohankar_257283_1600x1200.jpg", "https://static.catchnews.com/en/svg/lightening.svg", "https://images.catchnews.com/catchnews-2/svg/logo_sticky.svg", "http://images.catchnews.com/upload/2025/11/15/MEA_Secretary_Periasamy_Kumaran_257261_600x450.jpg", "https://static.catchnews.com/en/svg/mail.svg", "https://images.catchnews.com/upload/2022/03/02/shahrukh_srk_230984_300x172.jpg", "http://images.catchnews.com/upload/2025/04/10/Alexandra_Daddario_255633_300x172.jpg", "http://images.catchnews.com/upload/2025/11/15/kamini_257259_850x550.png"], "top_img": "https://images.catchnews.com/upload/2017/09/13/Jennifer_Lawrence013_81198_730x419.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.catchnews.com/hollywood-news/jennifer-lawrence-thanks-kardashians-for-getting-her-through-mother-s-intense-scenes-81198.html", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence thanks Kardashians for getting her through 'Mother's intense scenes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"pages": 818589351549328, "app_id": 818589351549328}, "propeller": "9984f4e2077ffe168e42c2ba2306081e", "Keywords": "Jennifer Lawrence , Darren Aronofsky , Kardashian , Mother , Vogue , Javier Bardem , Ed Harris , Michelle Pfeiffer , Black Swan , Latest News, Latest Hollywood News, Catch News", "Description": "It seems like the Kardashians have finally helped someone in Hollywood.", "news_keywords": "Jennifer Lawrence , Darren Aronofsky , Kardashian , Mother , Vogue , Javier Bardem , Ed Harris , Michelle Pfeiffer , Black Swan , Latest News, Latest Hollywood News, Catch News", "og": {"site_name": "CatchNews.com", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence thanks Kardashians for getting her through 'Mother's intense scenes", "url": "http://www.catchnews.com/hollywood-news/jennifer-lawrence-thanks-kardashians-for-getting-her-through-mother-s-intense-scenes-81198.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.catchnews.com/upload/2017/09/13/Jennifer_Lawrence013_81198_730x419.jpg", "width": 700, "height": 435}, "description": "It seems like the Kardashians have finally helped someone in Hollywood."}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CatchNews", "creator": "@CatchNews", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence thanks Kardashians for getting her through 'Mother's intense scenes", "description": "It seems like the Kardashians have finally helped someone in Hollywood.", "image": "https://images.catchnews.com/upload/2017/09/13/Jennifer_Lawrence013_81198_730x419.jpg"}, "atdlayout": "article"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.catchnews.com", "summary": ""}
