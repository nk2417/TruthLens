Riley FBR senior analyst Barton Crockett told THR that \"Solo\" will lose more than $50 million, while other industry financing sources told the outlet that the loss could exceed $80 million, depending on auxiliary revenues and the undisclosed, exact terms of Disney's deal for the film.\n\n\"Solo\" dropped 65% at the box office in its second weekend of release, and its global box office total currently stands at $264.3 million, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\n\"Solo\" also bombed in its opening weekend in China, as Business Insider's Jason Guerrasio reported. The film brought in only $10.1 million over Memorial Day weekend in China, a record low for \"Star Wars\" films in the country, though the franchise itself has historically never grabbed the attention of China, the world's second-largest movie market.\n\nIf it doesn't see a late surge, as analysts are predicting it won't, \"Solo\" will become the first movie from Disney and Lucasfilm to lose money.\n\n2017's \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" brought in $1.332 billion at the global box office, while the first \"Star Wars\" spin-off \"Rogue One\" grossed $1.056 billion in 2016.\n\nThe first collaboration from Disney and Lucasfilm, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" grossed $2.068 billion in 2015, setting off a renewal of the \"Star Wars\" series that is now likely to see its first miss in \"Solo.\"", "images": ["https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5b169cd142e1cc244102bdf8?width=700", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "https://i.insider.com/5b169cd142e1cc244102bdf7?width=875&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5b169cd142e1cc244102bdf7?width=875&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["John Lynch"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/solo-a-star-wars-story-expected-to-lose-disney-50-million-report-2018-6", "title": "'Solo' is expected to lose Disney at least $50 million, and become the first 'Star Wars' movie to lose money", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "'Solo' is expected to lose Disney at least $50 million, and become the first 'Star Wars' movie to lose money", "datePublished": "2018-06-05T14:08:18.000Z", "dateModified": "2018-06-08T14:08:38.000Z", "news_keywords": "Movies, Culture, Star Wars, Disney, Box Office", "description": "\"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" could lose at least $50 million for Disney and Lucasfilm, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"Solo\" is reportedly unlikely to gross past $400 million at the global box office against an estimated total budget that would exceed its gross.", "author": "John Lynch", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "og": {"title": "'Solo' is expected to lose Disney at least $50 million, and become the first 'Star Wars' movie to lose money", "description": "\"Solo: A Star Wars Story\" could lose at least $50 million for Disney and Lucasfilm, according to The Hollywood Reporter. \"Solo\" is reportedly unlikely to gross past $400 million at the global box office against an estimated total budget that would exceed its gross.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/solo-a-star-wars-story-expected-to-lose-disney-50-million-report-2018-6", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/5b169cd142e1cc244102bdf7?width=875&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 875, "height": 437}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"psvp": "c"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "5b169cd242e1cc244102bdf9", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"tags": "Page Type:story"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2025-05", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
