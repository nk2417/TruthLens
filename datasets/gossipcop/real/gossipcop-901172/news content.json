Some of our favorite shows thus far this year have owed so much to some staggering acting work. With two inevitable exceptions, we limited this overview to one performance per show, one role per actor. But there was some incredible range to be found in that work, which makes us excited for what the rest of 2017 has in store.\n\nREAD MORE: The 20 Best TV Episodes of 2017 (So Far)\n\nGillian Anderson, \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d\n\nThe way that Gillian Anderson, a pop culture icon in her own right, managed to embody famous figures like David Bowie and Marilyn Monroe went well beyond imitation. Each vision we got of Media left us chilled and unsettled thanks to Anderson\u2019s mastery over her gift, building layers upon layers in channeling characters who could have easily come off as clich\u00e9. Anderson doesn\u2019t often get the opportunity to show us the full scope of her range, but \u201cAmerican Gods\u201d was a wonderful exception.\n\nREAD MORE: Gillian Anderson Ruled \u2018American Gods\u2019: How the Many Faces of Media Were Chosen\n\nCarrie Coon, \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a scene in \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d series finale in which Nora, Carrie Coon\u2019s long-suffering former fraud investigator, shuts her bathroom door, draws herself a bath, and\u2026 then she can\u2019t get out. She\u2019s trapped. She wrestles with the knob, bangs on the giant wooden barrier, and then throws herself against it with all her might.\n\nIt works. She breaks through, and that\u2019s the point. The scene is meant, largely, to symbolize Nora\u2019s breakthrough; that she wants to see her long lost love, Kevin (Justin Theroux), despite claims to the contrary. But what makes the scene work is Coon. It\u2019s a moment of comedic absurdity amid a tragically romantic storyline, and Coon hits all the right notes. It\u2019s reminiscent of when she flipped out on a parking barrier in Episode 2 and then went directly to her friend\u2019s house to talk (and take a few bounces on a trampoline).\n\nCoon finds the truth in every moment, no matter how ridiculous, no matter how unbelievable. It\u2019s what makes her closing speech so powerful, and it\u2019s what makes Nora Durst one of the best characters of the 21st century. Coon understood the humanity of her role long before anyone could see past her darkness, and that guiding light made the journey to serenity immeasurably satisfying.\n\nREAD MORE: Why Do Machines Hate Carrie Coon on \u2018Fargo\u2019 and \u2018The Leftovers\u2019?\n\nRupert Friend, \u201cHomeland\u201d\n\nAfter taking the appropriate amount of time to grieve, we\u2019ve come to the following conclusion: Rupert Friend\u2019s \u201cHomeland\u201d swan song was a two-season affair. Perhaps Quinn really did die in Season 5, and Season 6 was just how Carrie (Claire Danes) had to say goodbye, with her one-time love living in her home, halfway to death\u2019s door. She indeed got him the rest of the way, to a hero\u2019s end. But while she did that for Quinn, Friend carried him throughout it all; through the reign of the Drone Queen to the heartbreak of losing Carrie all over again; through a brutal, infamous poisoning to wandering into drug dens with prostitutes. Quinn\u2019s journey was long and complicated, but Friend found honesty and power in every grave choice and dangerous situation. The physicality alone demands respect, and Friend made us feel for Quinn more than we ever expected \u2014 no matter when you said goodbye.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Homeland\u2019: An Ode to Rupert Friend\u2019s Quinn After a Divisive Finale\n\nKathryn Hahn, \u201cI Love Dick\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s so easy for a performance to be dominated by a single emotion, something that makes Hahn\u2019s starring role as Chris in \u201cI Love Dick\u201d all the more impressive. It\u2019s a character that\u2019s dealing with raging desire, crippling frustration, and all-consuming obsession, and Hahn plays all sides of that internal tug-of-war with equal ease. As Chris\u2019 life gets yanked in multiple directions, Hahn somehow keeps her grounded in a fierce, intense drive toward self preservation. It\u2019s hard to be hopelessly in love with an idea of a person, much less the person themself. But this is a performance that shows us why it\u2019s a fundamental driver of what makes compelling drama in real life and in fictional versions of it. There\u2019s an intense physicality to Hahn\u2019s approach, too. It\u2019s not just in the emotions that she betrays, it\u2019s in the way that they take over every bit of movement and stillness. As a result, Chris becomes a character you can easily build an entire town around.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018I Love Dick\u2019: Kathryn Hahn and Jill Soloway on Empowering Sex Scenes That Aren\u2019t All About Ejaculation\n\nNeil Patrick Harris, \u201cA Series of Unfortunate Events\u201d\n\nPlaying multiple roles is one thing, but playing one character deliberately embodying multiple characters, all while trying to match a very strange and specific tone, is a unique challenge for any actor. Fortunately, Neil Patrick Harris proved more than up for it, making each of his many forms distinct but unified by his villainous desires. His twisting eyebrows and sly looks sold every quasi-absurd moment of the series. \u201cA Series of Unfortunate Events\u201d owes a lot to the look and feel sculpted by director Barry Sonnenfeld, but without actors like Harris selling it, it\u2019d be nothing.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018A Series of Unfortunate Events\u2019: Neil Patrick Harris on Playing Four Roles as One Villain and Why He Had to Watch Jim Carrey\u2019s Take\n\nDamson Idris, \u201cSnowfall\u201d\n\nSneaking in just under the wire is a performance worthy of \u201cThe Wire\u2019s\u201d excellent young cast. 26-year-old Idris leads an impressive ensemble with the confidence and poise of someone twice his age. And while his accent work is so spot on that we can\u2019t pick out the transplant from southeast London from a group of kids from the south side of L.A., it only speaks to how relaxed, inviting, and empathetic his performance becomes. Only one episode of \u201cSnowfall\u201d has aired, but we\u2019ve seen enough of Idris to know he\u2019s good for the long haul.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Snowfall\u2019 Premiere: John Singleton on The Rise of Crack During His Youth and Exposing \u2018Terrifying\u2019 CIA Operations\n\nSanaa Lathan, \u201cShots Fired\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve seen hardass cops before. We\u2019ve seen hardass lady cops before. But we haven\u2019t seen Ashe Akino before, not the way Sanaa Lathan portrayed her in Fox\u2019s limited series, \u201cShots Fired.\u201d Constantly pulled between a far away family conflict and the immediate issues in the North Carolina town she\u2019s been sent, Lathan knew when to not give a shit and when to dig in deep. Her priorities were so in line it made her all the more engaging, as she bonded with her ambitious new partner and busted heads of bad guys. It was an ideal turn for broadcast TV: fun enough to earn fans and challenging enough to push them to think deeper.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Shots Fired\u2019: How George Zimmerman\u2019s Acquittal Led to Fox\u2019s Powerful New Series \u2014 IndieWire\u2019s Turn It On Podcast\n\nJude Law \u2013 \u201cThe Young Pope\u201d\n\nJude Law had already taken unexpected roles in the past, and as IndieWire\u2019s Anne Thompson points out, has transitioned from golden boy leading man to bold character actor with varying success. Nevertheless, Law vanquishes all of our expectations with the role of Lenny Belardo, the first-ever American pope in Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s playful TV masterpiece. Good-looking yet inscrutable, Lenny as Pope Pius XIII oozes a distinct kind of charm, tinged with dangerous condemnation. Law is able to completely sell this brash and overweening fellow before pivoting to reveal a deep vulnerability, indecision and humility. Law trusted in Sorrentino blindly, and it paid off with one of the most complex and yet passionately alive characters on TV. He\u2019s painfully soulful and electric all at once, and through Law\u2019s performance we are now believers that if anyone had a direct line to God through prayer, it would be Lenny with his goddamned smile.\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018The Young Pope\u2019: How Jude Law Went Weird with Paolo Sorrentino for His Best Work In Years\n\nContinued on the next page: The rest of our picks, including cast
