At the same time, Markle\u2019s half-sister Samantha Markle has been leaking information about their father and offering her own commentary about the Markle family\u2019s situation.\n\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of how everything unfolded, and where it stands now.\n\nApril and early May\n\nPhotos of Thomas Markle are published that appear to show him preparing for his daughter\u2019s wedding: exercising, getting fitted for a suit, and reading about British culture and tourism. They appear to be taken at various locations around Rosarito, Mexico, where he lives.\n\nOne of the photos showing Markle ostensibly preparing for his daughter's wedding.

ITV/\"Loose Women\"\n\nIn Mexico: TMZ reports Thomas Markle has decided not to attend the wedding in light of the revelation he had worked with a photo agency to stage the positive wedding prep scenes. He also tells TMZ he had a heart attack six days prior to the interview.\n\nMeanwhile: In a very unusual move, Kensington Palace releases a statement asking the public for privacy following the roller coaster reports of Thomas Markle\u2019s status: \u201cThis is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.\u201d\n\nMeghan Markle, an American mixed-race divorc\u00e9e with an unusual family situation, has been the subject of online abuse and criticism during her engagement to Prince Harry.

She says he was \u201cquite depressed over the unbelievable series of events involving the media.\u201d\n\nSamantha Markle on Good Morning Britain ITV\n\nIn Mexico: Thomas Markle apparently changes his mind about not attending, in part because of his Monday night conversations with Meghan. He tells TMZ he decided he wanted to attend the wedding and walk his daughter down the aisle.\n\nHours later, TMZ reports Thomas Markle is in the hospital and undergoing what TMZ calls a \u201cbattery of tests.\u201d He tells the outlet he will again not be attending the wedding: \u201cI hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle.\u201d\n\nWednesday, May 16\n\nThat morning: Thomas Markle tells TMZ he is scheduled to have heart surgery on Wednesday, potentially ruling out the possibility of him attending the wedding. Markle told TMZ that doctors will \u201cgo in and clear blockage, repair damage and put a stent where it is needed.\u201d\n\nThomas Markle's unusual back-and-forth about the wedding has made for unflattering headlines. CNN\n\nThat afternoon: Thomas Markle tells TMZ he\u2019s out of surgery and will be staying in the hospital for a few more days. \u201cI\u2019m OK. It will take a long time to heal.\n\nThursday, May 17\n\nThat morning: Meghan Markle confirms her dad won\u2019t attend her wedding: \u201cI have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u201d\n\nFriday, May 18\n\nPrince Charles; Prince of Wales Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry attend Christmas Day Church service at Church of St Mary Magdalene on December 25, 2017 Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nThat morning: Kensington Palace says Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.
