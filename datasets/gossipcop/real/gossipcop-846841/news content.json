{"url": "https://www.kwtx.com/content/news/Fixer-Upper-star-Chip-Gaines-named-in-million-dollar-lawsuit-420657614.html", "text": "Two former partners of Chip Gaines in the creation of the Magnolia Real Estate Company are suing the \u201cFixer Upper\u201d star for fraud, claiming that Gaines bought them out without telling them that HGTV had decided to broadcast the show nationally \u201cand that the show prominently featured the \u2018Magnolia\u2019 brand name.\u201d\n\nIn the 24-page lawsuit filed Wednesday in state district court in Waco, Gaines\u2019s two former partners, lawyers John L. Lewis and Richard L. Clark, are seeking more than $1 million in damages and non-monetary relief, as well.\n\nGaines\u2019 spokesman declined to comment on the suit, but his attorney, Jordan Mayfield, told KWTX Thursday, \u201cWe are confident that these claims will be found to be meritless, and it is disappointing to see people try to take advantage of the hard work and success of Chip and Joanna Gaines.\"\n\nLewis and Clark were equal partners with Gaines in founding the Magnolia Real Estate Company in 2007.\n\nThe suit says that for the first six years, the company largely operated in Waco with a single real estate agent.\n\nThe suit claims Gaines worked out a deal with HGTV for the \u201cFixer Upper\u201d program without telling his partners and that Gaines planned on featuring the Magnolia brand name.\n\nGaines bought their shares of Magnolia Real estate for $2,500 each, the suit says.\n\n\"With this insider information in hand, Chip Gaines convinced plaintiffs to sell their membership interests in Magnolia Realty quickly to him before a public announcement that \u201cFixer Upper\u201d was picked up by HGTV.\"\n\nThe suit, which also names Magnolia Realty, Scripps Networks Interactive, Scripps networks LLC and High Noon Entertainment which produces the show, claims Gaines pressured Lewis and Clark to sell \u201cbefore they discovered the company\u2019s value was radically enhanced by \u2018Fixer Upper.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhen Clark balked at the terms of the buyout, the suit alleges Gaines sent a text advising Lewis to tell Clark \u201cto be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t come from the nerdy prep school he\u2019s from. And when people talk to me that way they get their asses kicked. And if he\u2019s not ready to do that he better shut his mouth. I\u2019m not the toughest guy there is, but I can assure you that would not end well for [R]ick,\u201d the text read, according to the suit.\n\nSince the show debuted, the suit says, Magnolia has grown from a single-agent firm to one that employs \u201cover 93 real estate agents, and a support staff, and now operates in nearly every major city in Texas.\u201d\n\nIn addition to monetary damages, the suit seeks rescission of the sale of the company or fair value for Lewis\u2019 and Clark\u2019s interest, payment of salaries, bonuses in-kind benefits and distributions they would have received as partners", "images":
