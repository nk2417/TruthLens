And Saturday night, at the Warsaw stop of Jay-Z and Beyonce\u2019s \u201cOn the Run II\u201d tour, a flying stage that ordinarily enables the singer to hover over the grown got stuck 20 feet in the air, forcing a rather undignified exit.\n\nStage techs were forced to go old-school to bring Beyonce back down to earth via an ordinary ladder. The band vamped while Beyonce initially appeared reluctant to descend via the ladder \u2014 understandable considering her towering heels \u2014 but eventually capitulated.\n\nIn a fan video (h/t Daily Beast), fans can be heard chanting the singer\u2019s name while one yells in a thick Polish accent, \u201cYou can do it!\u201d The fan who posted the video wrote: \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s flying stage got broken at the end of the show in Warsaw and she had to walk down on a ladder. She also gave us a little cute dance!\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe tour kicked off June 6 in Cardiff, UK, and covers 15 cities across the UK and Europe, with the 21-date North American leg beginning July 25 in Cleveland.
