Ahead, everything we know about Brooks and her relationship with the Hunger Games star.\n\nShe is an Australian model.\n\nBrooks was born on May 18, 1996, making her 28 years old. Like Hemsworth, she is Australian and grew up in Sydney. She was discovered as a model when she was just 14, and has since modeled for brands including Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein, and Valentino. She made her runway debut at Australian Fashion Week in May 2023.\n\nLia Toby // Getty Images\n\nShe started dating Liam in 2019.\n\nMonths after his split from then-wife Miley Cyrus, Hemsworth began seeing Brooks. In December 2019, the couple were seen out in Australia with the actor\u2019s parents. Still, Hemsworth is notoriously discrete, so they did not make their public debut as a couple until June 2021, when they attended a charity event in Australia. Hemsworth even shared a photo of them together there on his Instagram.\n\nAlso in 2021, Brooks reportedly moved in with Hemsworth in Los Angeles. Still, it wasn\u2019t until 2022 that the pair made their red-carpet debut. They attended the premiere of Poker Face in Sydney on November 15 of that year, and it was all worth the wait, as Hemsworth looked dapped in a classic black suit, while Brooks glowed in a golden halterneck gown.\n\nBrendon Thorne // Getty Images\n\nIn 2023, they attended another red-carpet event\u2014the NGV Gala in Melbourne\u2014and Brooks shared a photo of them holding hands in their elegant ensembles on her Instagram. They also made a joint appearance at the premiere of Extraction 2 in New York City, and at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.\n\nAnd earlier this year, they coordinated in black at the U.K. premiere of Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, in London.\n\nKarwai Tang // Getty Images\n\nShe had another high-profile relationship.\n\nBefore Hemsworth, Brooks dated Matty Healy, frontman of the 1975, for four years. The two broke up in 2019, years before Healy famously rekindled his flame with Taylor Swift and then became engaged to Gabbriette Bechtel.", "images":
