While the Heartbreak on a Full Moon singer no longer has the monkey, he may be facing criminal charges and jail time.\n\nBrown had previously posted a photo of his 3-year-old daughter Royalty holding a capuchin monkey. Following the posting of the photo, California Department of Fish and Wildlife opened an investigation into the singer and his monkey.\n\nBreezy eventually voluntarily agreed to surrender the animal but he can still be charged with a having a restricted species without a permit. The charge is a misdemeanor that carries a maximum of six months in prison.\n\nWhile Brown has yet to comment on the matter, his lawyer, Mark Geragos, told the site, \"As I leave my office in Downtown L.A. and walk past people sleeping on the street on my way to defend people charged by the city attorney with selling medical marijuana... Now spending taxpayer money on investigating monkey business, this completes the circle on his absurdity.\"\n\nIn related Chris Brown news, the singer recently teased an upcoming join project with fellow R&B crooner, Jacquees. \"@Jacquees we family so we gone fuck this r&b shit up,\" Brown wrote in a tweet accompanying a video featuring the two in the studio together.\n\nSee Photos of Chris Brown's Different Looks Over the Years", "images": ["http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/06/attachment-Drake-T-Pain-Chris-Brown-Chubbs.jpg?w=980&q=75", "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2017/03/chris-brown-legal.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2019/09/attachment-diamond-rappers-eminem-drake-tupac-shakur-50-cent.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/01/attachment-Chris-Brown-Lawsuit.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2017/03/chris-brown-legal.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2024/07/attachment-eminem-drake-jay-z-tupac-shakur.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/07/attachment-Chris-Brown-Lawsuit-2.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2023/04/attachment-chris-brown-producer-club-attack.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/05/attachment-Chris-Brown-HoodyBaby-Arrested.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/06/attachment-Chris-Brown-Court.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2024/07/attachment-chris-brown.jpg?w=980&q=75", "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2017/10/xxl-trimmed-spacing.png"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2017/03/chris-brown-legal.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Mojica"], "canonical_link": "https://www.xxlmag.com/chris-brown-criminal-charges-pet-monkey/", "title": "Chris Brown Could Face Jail Time for Pet Monkey", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "xxl", "description": "Chris Brown may have surrendered his capuchin monkey but the singer could still face jail time.", "keywords": "chris brown news, chris brown, chris brown monkey, chris brown capuchin, chris brown capuchin monkey,news", "fb": {"app_id": 184854740153433, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "enable=true ad_density=low", "admins": 100002025987268, "pages": 197474901813}, "og": {"title": "Chris Brown Could Face Jail Time for Pet Monkey", "description": "Chris Brown may have surrendered his capuchin monkey but the singer could still face jail time.", "url": "https://www.xxlmag.com/chris-brown-criminal-charges-pet-monkey/", "site_name": "XXL Mag", "type": "article", "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2017/03/chris-brown-legal.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@XXL"}, "sailthru.description": "Chris Brown may have surrendered his capuchin monkey but the singer could still face jail time.", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-12 16:51:16", "sailthru.title": "Chris Brown Could Face Jail Time for Pet Monkey", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-xxl, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, chris-brown, news", "sailthru.author": "nickmojica", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2017/03/chris-brown-legal.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2017/03/chris-brown-legal.jpg", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "ad": {"primis": {"id": 113736}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515793876.0, "source": "http://www.xxlmag.com", "summary": ""}
