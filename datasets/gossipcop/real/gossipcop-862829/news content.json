{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_on_the_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame", "text": "The following list includes the names, locations, and categories of all the stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The categories are motion pictures, television, recording, radio, live performance, and sports entertainment. The list does not include a star's name until his or her award ceremony has taken place, not at the time of nomination or an accepted nomination.\n\nThe stars are ordered alphabetically by surname, and all names are shown as they appear on the stars. A performer can have more than one star, recognising their separate achievements in more than one category. While the first seven honorees received their temporary stars in 1958, the list had grown by February 8, 1960, when the first 1,563 permanent stars were placed in the sidewalks along Hollywood Boulevard, already including 199 performers with repeat recognitions, such as the first three (of four) stars for Bob Hope and the first four (of five) stars for Gene Autry. All entries can be found on the Hollywood Walk of Fame website maintained by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce (see the External links section below). As of 3 November 2025 , with a ceremony honoring Sherri Shepherd, there are 2,827 stars embedded along the boulevard.[1]\n\nA [ edit ]\n\nB [ edit ]\n\nC [ edit ]\n\nD [ edit ]\n\nE [ edit ]\n\nF [ edit ]\n\nG [ edit ]\n\nH [ edit ]\n\nI [ edit ]\n\nJ [ edit ]\n\nK [ edit ]\n\nL [ edit ]\n\nM [ edit ]\n\nN [ edit ]\n\nO [ edit ]\n\nP [ edit ]\n\nQ [ edit ]\n\nName Category Address Date Dennis Quaid Motion pictures 7018 Hollywood Boulevard ( 2005-11-16 ) November 16, 2005 Randy Quaid Motion pictures 7000 Hollywood Boulevard ( 2003-10-07 ) October 7, 2003 Queen Recording 6356 Hollywood Boulevard ( 2002-10-18 ) October 18, 2002 Anthony Quinn Motion pictures 6251 Hollywood Boulevard ( 1960-02-08 ) February 8, 1960 Selena Quintanilla Recording 1750 Vine Street ( 2017-11-03 ) November 3, 2017\n\nR [ edit ]\n\nS [ edit ]\n\nT [ edit ]\n\nU [ edit ]\n\nName Category Address Date Carrie Underwood Recording 1750 Vine Street ( 2018-09-20 ) September 20, 2018 USC School of Cinematic Arts Special 900 W 34th Street ( 2009-09-10 ) September 10, 2009 Robert Urich Television 7083 Hollywood Boulevard ( 1995-12-12 ) December 12, 1995 Usher Recording 6201 Hollywood Boulevard ( 2016-09-07 ) September 7, 2016\n\nV [ edit ]\n\nW [ edit ]\n\nX [ edit ]\n\nNo Entries\n\nY [ edit ]\n\nZ [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]", "images": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/40px-Commons-logo.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_on_the_Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame", "title": "List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=1120", "og": {"title": "List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
