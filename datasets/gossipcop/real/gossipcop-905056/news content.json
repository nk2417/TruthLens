In an Instagram comment, the star of \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d said planning for the red carpet the day before the event required \u201c6 hours, 60 artists, 8 activists and a lot of coffee.\u201d And one of those people, Thompson said, was not Lena Dunham.\n\nIn the celebratory photo Thompson posted yesterday are Michelle Williams, Billie Jean King, Rashida Jones, Susan Sarandon, Laura Dern \u2014 and, on the end of the middle row, far right, is Dunham. The \u201cGirls\u201d creator and star has lain low of late; the last Tweet she wrote was an apology for casting doubt on Aurora Perrineau\u2019s rape accusation. And, according to Thompson, her participation in Time\u2019s Up planning was limited to the photo op: \u201cLena was not anywhere present in our group during the countless hours of work for the last two months.\u201d\n\nThompson\u2019s statement, which came in response to several commenters questioning why Dunham was in the picture at all, reads in full:\n\n\u201cLena was not anywhere present in our group during the countless hours of work for the last two months. We hosted an open house for actresses for red carpet messaging and Lena presence was a surprise to us all. This is a time of reckoning. And for many, a re-education. So many women also have real work to do. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too nuanced a conversation to have on this platform. But I hear you, and know that your thoughts and words are not lost on me. It\u2019s been discussed\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the initiative remains to be seen, but it shows no signs of slowing down. Most attendees wore black last night in recognition of the sexual-harassment problem in Hollywood and beyond, and Time\u2019s Up was brought up several times throughout the ceremony.\n\nWhen asked to comment by IndieWire, Dunham responded, \u201cI was honored to be invited to the meeting by a close friend and to observe the work that these amazing women have been doing the past few months. For highly personal reasons, I\u2019ve been unable to join previous efforts but being asked to be a part of this celebratory moment was truly beautiful. I\u2019ve worked with Tessa and respect her artistry and admire her consistent candor.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BdrXV4Nl5Nk/\n\nAdditional reporting by Jenna Marotta.", "images": ["https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/caitlin-clark-wnbpa-panini.png?resize=232,175", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Warner-Bros.-Discovery-.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7155.jpg?w=3000&h=2656&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shutterstock_9126770ew.jpg?w=3000&h=1687&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TNB_05859_R-H-2024-1.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/kristen-bell-jesus.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shutterstock_9126770ew.jpg?w=650", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7417.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/anaconda.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/john-and-yoko.jpg?w=770&h=980&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2233861423.jpg?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thoughts-and-prayers-hbo.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple_TV_Your_Friends_and_Neighbors_key_art_graphic_header_16_9_show_home.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1928402338-e1705520037474.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2246549744.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-01-at-8.32.46\u202fPM.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/MCDHEDD_MG006.jpg?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7173.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-Lowdown-Ethan-Hawke-interview.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shutterstock_9126770ew.jpg?w=650", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Nordine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/tessa-thompson-lena-dunham-times-up-golden-globes-1201915359/", "title": "Tessa Thompson Calls Out Lena Dunham, Says She \u2018Was Not Anywhere Present\u2019 for Time\u2019s Up Planning", "meta_data": {"description": "Dunham's presence in a photo celebrating the initiative raised eyebrows.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400654071", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Michael Nordine", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Tessa Thompson Calls Out Lena Dunham, Says She \u2018Was Not Anywhere Present\u2019 for Time\u2019s Up Planning", "url": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/tessa-thompson-lena-dunham-times-up-golden-globes-1201915359/", "description": "Dunham's presence in a photo celebrating the initiative raised eyebrows.", "site_name": "IndieWire", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shutterstock_9126770ew.jpg?w=650", "width": 650, "height": 433, "alt": "Tessa Thompson Thor: Ragnarok premiere"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-09T02:17:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-09T13:35:25+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Dunham's presence in a photo celebrating the initiative raised eyebrows.", "site": "@IndieWire", "creator": "@slowbeard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Tessa Thompson Calls Out Lena Dunham, Says She \u2018Was Not Anywhere Present\u2019 for Time\u2019s Up Planning", "image": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shutterstock_9126770ew.jpg?w=650"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-iw_favicon.png?w=270", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515464256.0, "source": "https://www.indiewire.com", "summary": ""}
