After premiering his first solo single 'Sign Of The Times' on BBC Radio 1, he's been chinwagging away to Key 103 about One Direction bandmate Liam Payne's baby with Cheryl, and whether he's going to be godfather.\n\nIMAGINE. Surely it's girlband and boyband law that someone from 1D and Girls Aloud have to be involved, right?\n\nOn March 22nd, Cheryl gave birth to the second One Direction baby after they both announced on Instagram that they were now the proud parents to a little boy. She wrote:\n\n\"On Wednesday 22nd March Liam and I became parents to an incredibly beautiful, healthy baby boy, weighing 7lb 9 and looking like a dream. Although he still doesn't have a name he is already stealing hearts. We are all madly in love and overwhelmingly happy with our little arrival. Happy Mother's Day to all the mothers around the world. A day that now has a different meaning to me forever.\"\n\nAnd although we haven't heard much from the new parents about how they're getting on so far, Harry did tell Key 103's Darryl Morris that Liam was 'loving' being a dad, and that they're all doing great - as well as the fact he'd be 'honoured' to be godfather.\n\nHarry commented: \"[Liam] said it's going really well and everyone's great, so I'm very happy for him\", before moving onto the topic of who the godfather's going to be. \"I think it's a roll of the dice, there are a lot of people Liam has in mind.\n\n\"I'm not going to add any extra pressure. If it came my way I would be honoured.\"\n\nWe're here for it.\n\nLike this?
