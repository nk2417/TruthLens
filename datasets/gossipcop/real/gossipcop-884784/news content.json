It was not a pleasant experience for Jones, and he made it crystal clear to Carrey, the Truman Show actor explained.\n\n\u201cI was the star and that was the problem,\u201d Carrey guessed. \u201cHe\u2019s a phenomenal actor, though. I still love him.\u201d\n\nThe situation came to a head in the middle of production, before the two had their \u201cbiggest scene together\u201d on the Joel Schumacher film, when Carrey randomly popped into the same restaurant that Jones was having dinner, he told Macdonald.\n\n\u201cThe maitre said, \u2018Oh, I hear you\u2019re working with Tommy Lee Jones. He\u2019s over in the corner having dinner.\u2019 I went over and I said, \u2018Hey Tommy, how are you doing?\u2019 and the blood just drained from his face,\u201d Carrey said. \u201cAnd he got up shaking \u2014 he must have been in mid kill me fantasy or something like that. And he went to hug me and he said, \u2018I hate you. I really don\u2019t like you.\u2019 And I said, \u2018What\u2019s the problem?\u2019 and pulled up a chair, which probably wasn\u2019t smart. And he said, \u2018I cannot sanction your buffoonery.'\u201d\n\nMacdonald said Jones\u2019 ire likely came from Carrey, who had risen quickly to become a huge star, being the center of attention no matter the room he entered.\n\nCarrey had a different theory.\n\n\u201cHe might have been uncomfortable doing that work, too,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not really his style of stuff.\u201d\n\nHear Carrey\u2019s story about Jones at the 1:08:30 mark.
