The Grammy winner paired the look with strappy black sandals and dark shades. She wore her blonde locks in a high pony.\n\nJAY-Z, 46, matched his wife in an all-black activewear ensemble, with drawstring pants, a hoodie, a trench jacket, sneakers, and a flat brim hat.\n\nSplash News\n\nTheir night out comes nearly a week after the couple dropped a surprise album, Everything Is Love.\n\nThe nine-track LP, which lists the powerhouse couple simply as The Carters, has the pair opening up about everything from love child allegations (spoiler alert: JAY-Z says the claims are false) to his cheating scandal.\n\n\u201cYou did some things to me / Boy you do some things to me / But love is deeper than your pain and I believe you can change,\u201d Bey sings on the album closer, \u201cLOVEHAPPY.\u201d\n\nEverything Is Love first dropped on Saturday, as the parents of three played their concert at a London stadium. They announced the record with a simple \u201calbum out now\u201d text appearing on a screen.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve all given so much love every time we come here \u2014 thank you. Because we love you all so much we have something special for y\u2019all,\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 told the crowd. \u201cWe want you guys to be the first to experience this new project. And we have a new visual for you guys. We want you all to count down \u2014 10, 9, 8\u2026\u201d\n\nWatch the full season of Search History on PeopleTV.com or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.\n\nPictureGroup/Shutterstock\n\nOn the Run II tour began June 6 in Cardiff, and will hit a total of 15 European cities before arriving in North America on July 25 at Cleveland\u2019s FirstEnergy Stadium for the first of 21 North American dates.\n\nThe couple played the Amsterdam Arena in the Netherlands on Tuesday, and are next heading to Copenhagen, Denmark, for a concert on Saturday at DK Parken Stadium.\n\nA source previously told PEOPLE that Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z were \u201cincredibly excited\u201d to return to the stage together, adding that, \u201cIt took a lot of work to make this happen. It\u2019s the best choice for their family.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Did JAY-Z & Beyonc\u00e9 Renew Their Vows? New Video & Photos from On the Run II Tour Shows Ceremony with Twins\n\nAnd speaking of family, twins Rumi and Sir, 1, and daughter Blue Ivy, 6, are also on tour with Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z.\n\nWork hasn\u2019t stopped them from family time, either. The Carters had \u201ca small celebration\u201d recently for the Rumi and Siri\u2019s June 13th birthday, a family source told PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy that Rumi and Sir are already 1,\u201d the insider said. \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s mom [Tina Knowles Lawson] is traveling with the family and was, of course, there for the celebration. Everyone says they can\u2019t believe how quickly the past year has gone.\u201d\n\nThe source added, \u201cThey\u2019re the cutest and doing very well. Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay seem happy.\u201d", "images":
