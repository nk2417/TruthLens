But as it turns out, at least two A-listers have known about at least one case since the 1990s.\n\nOn Monday, Matt Damon said he knew that Weinstein had allegedly sexually harassed Gwyneth Paltrow, and that he'd learned of the alleged incident from Ben Affleck, whom Paltrow dated on and off from 1997 to 2000.\n\n\"I never talked to Gwyneth about it,\" he told ABC News. \"Ben told me, but I knew that they had come to whatever, you know, agreement or understanding that they had come to, she had handled it. She was, you know, the first lady of Miramax. And he treated her incredibly respectfully.\"\n\nPreviously, Damon had been accused of helping kill a 2004 New York Times story that would have exposed Weinstein's alleged sexual misconduct. Both New York Times editors and Damon have denied the accusation, which was made by reporter Sharon Waxman in a first-person piece on The Wrap.\n\nDamon admitted to the knowledge of Paltrow's story in an interview with ABC News's Michael Strahan, who was interviewing Damon and co-star George Clooney for their upcoming film, Suburbicon. When asked about the Weinstein scandal, both actors denied knowing about any longstanding history of \"sexual predation,\" although both acknowledged they'd known the ousted film producer was a \"womanizer.\"\n\n\"When people say like, 'Everybody knew,' Like, yeah, I knew he was an asshole,\" Damon said. \"He was proud of that. That's how he carried himself. I knew he was a womanizer. I wouldn't want to be married to the guy. But it's not my business really. But this level of criminal sexual predation is not something that I ever thought was going on. Absolutely not.\"\n\nClooney added that Weinstein would talk to him about women he'd had affairs with, although he didn't necessarily believe the producer because to do so \"would be to believe the worst of some actresses who were friends of mine.\" He said, \"And I didn't think they were going to have affairs with Harvey, quite honestly. And clearly, they didn't. But the idea that this predator, this assaulter, was out there silencing women like that is beyond infuriating.\"", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/59ee275e3c8dda559aea8178/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-613295138.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/690cc01e66ddff16cb311bd3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/68ff9a615d6b62c3d564441c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/690cde7a1c5c64107ca61f86/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/691d309e945261fe6eb5c277/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/69090947ab06a81174040a32/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6908db9e6df9c40528ad1e6b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/59ee27663c8dda559aea817a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-631368526.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/69026e16a3d6f55983565e94/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/690cb7101c5c64107ca61f5f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/68fb97fea6008a82c6ee2ce9/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/69023dfbd34605d4d763f127/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/691390c7f3aaf54e55f67920/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/690117fe232c4178c6e9eba8/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/59ee27663c8dda559aea817a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-631368526.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evelyn Wang"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/matt-damon-knew-harvey-weinstein-allegedly-harassed-gwyneth-paltrow", "title": "Matt Damon Admits He Knew Harvey Weinstein Allegedly Harassed Gwyneth Paltrow", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Evelyn Wang", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Matt Damon and George Clooney both knew Harvey Weinstein was a womanizer but not a predator, while Damon admits he knew about Gwyneth Paltrow's harassment.", "id": "59ee06b3a630e345ec99bf71", "keywords": "snd,matt damon,george clooney,harvey weinstein,sexual harassment,ben affleck", "news_keywords": "snd,matt damon,george clooney,harvey weinstein,sexual harassment,ben affleck", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59ee06b3a630e345ec99bf71", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Matt Damon and George Clooney both knew Harvey Weinstein was a womanizer but not a predator, while Damon admits he knew about Gwyneth Paltrow's harassment.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/59ee27663c8dda559aea817a/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-631368526.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/59ee27663c8dda559aea817a/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-631368526.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "And he learned about it from Ben Affleck.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/59ee27663c8dda559aea817a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-631368526.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Matt Damon Admits He Knew Harvey Weinstein Allegedly Harassed Gwyneth Paltrow", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/matt-damon-knew-harvey-weinstein-allegedly-harassed-gwyneth-paltrow"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-10-23T17:22:37.247Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-23T17:22:37.247Z", "author": "Evelyn Wang"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "And he learned about it from Ben Affleck.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/59ee27663c8dda559aea817a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-631368526.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Matt Damon Admits He Knew Harvey Weinstein Allegedly Harassed Gwyneth Paltrow"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/59ee27663c8dda559aea817a/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/GettyImages-631368526.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508779357.247, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
