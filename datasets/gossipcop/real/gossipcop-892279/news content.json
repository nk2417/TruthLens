Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.\n\nAt such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.\n\nThe Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/07/22/gettyimages-848091334.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/07/22/gettyimages-848091334.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/07/22/gettyimages-848091334.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/ed-westwick-rape-latest-lapd-investigate-kristina-cohen-gossip-girl-a8043176.html", "title": "Ed Westwick rape allegation 'being investigated by LAPD'", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/tv/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "Gossip Girl actor denies the claim", "og": {"updated_time": "2017-11-08T08:59:13.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Ed Westwick rape allegation 'being investigated by LAPD'", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/tv/news/ed-westwick-rape-latest-lapd-investigate-kristina-cohen-gossip-girl-a8043176.html", "type": "article", "description": "Gossip Girl actor denies the claim", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/07/22/gettyimages-848091334.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/07/22/gettyimages-848091334.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-08T08:59:13.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-08T08:59:13.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "TV & Radio", "author_name": "Jon Sharman", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 235, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 2, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 0, "external_link_count": 1}, "date": "2017-11-08T08:59:13.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176974152"}, "twitter": {"title": "Ed Westwick rape allegation 'being investigated by LAPD'", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Gossip Girl actor denies the claim", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/07/22/gettyimages-848091334.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Ed Westwick\",\"Harvey Weinstein\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510131553.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
