He was tweeting about the episodes that they're working on now when he teased that a major character could die in the mid-season finale.\n\n\"Episode 308 is our mid-season finale!\" he tweeted first. \"(#Riverdale hasn't even premiered and we're already shooting our mid-season finale!!)\"\n\n(via Riverdale/The CW)\n\nAguirre-Sacasa then followed up his first tweet with a scarier one: \"Life goes on (for MOST of our series regulars) in Episode #309 of #Riverdale\u2026\"\n\nEpisode 308 is our mid-season finale!
