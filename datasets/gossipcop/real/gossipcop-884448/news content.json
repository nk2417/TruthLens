{"url": "https://www.thewrap.com/ellen-degeneres-vegas/", "text": "On Tuesday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Ellen Show,\u201d which was taped on Monday just hours after the deadly shooting in Las Vegas, Ellen DeGeneres asked her audience to not lose hope, and to remember that there is still goodness in the world.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I feel sad, I feel anxious, I feel helpless,\u201d said the daytime TV host. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to lose hope, but we cannot do that. I always say that there\u2019s a lot more good in the world than there is bad, and I continue to believe that. And that is what we have to focus on.\u201d\n\nTo provide comfort for her viewers, DeGeneres played a six minute montage of people who have appeared on her show who do good in the world \u2014 from simple acts, like a diner waitress serving breakfast on the house to two firefighters, to a crowd of people lifting a burning car to rescue a man trapped underneath.\n\n\u201cThe world is full of amazing people,\u201d DeGeneres reassured her audience. \u201cGood will always win. Love will always win.\u201d\n\nWatch Ellen\u2019s speech in the clip above.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-03-at-8.28.22-AM.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325_COVER-_IR_5x4.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeremy-Fuster.png?resize=150%2C150&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeremy-Fuster.png?fit=53%2C58&quality=80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-03-at-8.28.22-AM.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeremy Fuster", "Film Reporter", "Joined Thewrap In", "Covers Box Office", "Labor News.
