She was the best audience. She was the one I was always trying to make laugh and she was such a fan of the show, and everything I did,\" Fallon shared. \"When we were little, my mom would walk us to the store, me and my sister, and we would hold hands and she would squeeze my hand three times to say I love you and I would squeeze I love you too.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Last week, I was in the hospital and I grabbed her hand and I squeezed I love you and I just knew we were in trouble, you know?\"\n\nCelebrity Deaths: 2017's Fallen Stars\n\nE!
