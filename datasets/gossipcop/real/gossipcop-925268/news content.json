The E! show premieres on Sunday, May 20 at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\nIn the preview, the pro wrestlers have a tearful conversation about Bella\u2019s desire to have children, even though Cena has been open about not wanting to have kids in the past.\n\n\u201cI would never force you not to be a mom,\u201d Cena tells his fianc\u00e9e.\n\n\u201cI thought I could really sacrifice that and I just can\u2019t,\u201d Bella responds.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure we should go through with this,\u201d Cena tells her.\n\nThe moment of doubt threw WWE fans into a panic when a snippet of it first aired last month, but thankfully, the wedding is still on.\n\nDuring Bella\u2019s appearance on Steve TV last month, she revealed that the heartbreaking moment was just that, a moment of doubt.\n\n\u201cWe had a moment where we did call it off. I think the one thing that I realized about wedding planning is everyone always tells you how amazing it is and all these things, but I think you also come to realize how permanent it is and you do a lot of soul-searching. I wanted this for 6 years and when I came face to face to it, I had to be like \u2018wait, is this what I want?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nCena shared his perspective on the matter during an appearance on TODAY.\n\n\u201cI think in relationships, you have highs and lows, and that was an extreme low,\u201d Cena said on TODAY. \u201cYou have two choices. You either jump ship and start a new relationship or move forward and try to work through it. We\u2019re gonna move forward and try to work through it.\u201d\n\nCena went on to reassure millions of fans that he and Bella were still deeply in love and heading toward the altar.\n\n\u201cLike I said, I believe we both have some work to do, and we\u2019re genuinely trying our best to work through it, so I\u2019m very happy to say that it\u2019s in a situation that we\u2019re working through,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet jumped ship.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the wedding drama, Total Bellas fans will also get to see Brie Bella and Daniel Bryan enjoy daughter Birdie Joe Danielson\u2019s many firsts and milestones. Bryan is also cleared to return to the WWE after time off recovering from injuries.\n\nThe Bella twins will also juggle their businesses as they prepare to return to the ring as a duo.\n\nSeason 3 of Total Bellas premieres Sunday, May 20 at 9 p.m. ET on E!\n\nPhoto credit: Dia Dipasupil/Getty Images", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/boston-blue-faith-and-family-sonequa-martin-green-donnie-wahlberg-cbs.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/04/45511bc5-8791-4d0b-a2e9-34e9c9011b24.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/70afec6a-3143-4947-b047-428e525611d4.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Rumer", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/news/total-bellas-trailer-john-cena-nikki-bella-wedding-second-thoughts/", "title": "\u2018Total Bellas\u2019 Sneak Peek: John Cena and Nikki Bella Have Second Thoughts About Getting Married", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Total Bellas' Sneak Peek: John Cena and Nikki Bella Have Second Thoughts About Getting Married", "description": "Could John Cena and Nikki Bella\u2018s long-awaited wedding be called off?
