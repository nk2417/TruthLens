Lonely? Vulnerable? On the shelf? You know why you married him. Your bio-clock was deafening, you were on the rebound, you might even have loved the guy (all things are possible) and harboured romantic notions of home, hearth and a happy-ever-after.\n\n\n\nYou tied the knot, hurled the bouquet, had the honeymoon, stuck the snaps in a padded album, paid off the credit card bill, dry-cleaned your frock, and set about the business of wedded bliss. So far, so nuptial. And then you get the urge to do it again.\n\n\n\nTwelve months, a decade, 20 years down the line, that beautiful fairytale rears its ugly head once more.\n\n\n\nIll-fated: Madonna and Guy renewed their wedding vows last summer, not long before they split up\n\n\n\nSuddenly, you are printing invitations for a jaded cast who saw it all before.\n\n\n\nSTOP. I'm here to say don't.\n\nSpeaking as one who has suffered the embarrassment and indignity of terminal abandonment a mere fortnight after we did the I Do, Take Two, I'm suggesting you sprint a mile from the notion that the renewal of wedding vows is a many-splendoured thing.\n\n\n\nOn the contrary, it can be the kiss of death to a happy marriage. I know. I've been there.\n\n\n\nAnd so have two of my friends and an acquaintance, not to mention countless others (including Madonna and Guy, Amy Winehouse and Blake) upon whom the experience backfired big-time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only can none of us explain why we succumbed in the first place, but I can't imagine for the life of me why it is suddenly all the rage.\n\n\n\nYes folks, married couples are retying the knot in droves. From the Beckhams to Katie and Peter, everybody's at it.\n\n\n\nCue dancing, wedding cake, endless toasts, and yet another honeymoon hangover.\n\n\n\nAs the country teeters on the brink of bankruptcy, the traditional family staggers towards extinction and with fewer people marrying than ever before in England and Wales (a mere 231,450 couples in 2007, the lowest since records began 150 years ago), the renewal of vows is now one of the fastest-rising social phenomena.\n\n\n\nSeparated: Renewing their vows didn't save Amy Winehouse and Blake Fielder-Civil's marriage\n\nWith some 87,000 designated websites offering advice on everything vow-renewal-related, and with the average wedding costing upwards of \u00a320,000, the mind boggles at where the money's coming from.\n\n\n\nAnd despite the fact that marriage vow renewal has no legal significance, local register offices, as well as popular civil wedding venues and luxury travel firms, are reporting unprecedented interest and bookings this year.\n\n\n\nWhile a variety of socioeconomic developments go some way towards explaining the decline in marriage, the current taste for re-pledging commitment to an existing spouse is a bit of a mystery.\n\n\n\n'There are any number of reasons why a couple decide to renew their vows,' says one leading London psychologist. 'Plenty of women are in love with the wedding itself, and can never quite get it out of their system.\n\n\n\n'The wedding takes precedence over everyday ordinariness and the low-key routine of being a wife, which by comparison is pretty boring.\n\n\n\n'If it's the husband who has suggested vow-renewal, he may feel guilty about something - infidelity or other betrayal - or have something monumental to hide which he is trying to deflect attention from.'\n\nOthers, he says, are looking for escapism from doom and gloom: 'It's an excuse for a party, to cheer everyone up.'\n\n\n\nBut it's a pretty extreme way of doing it. Why not just have a bash on a wedding anniversary?\n\n\n\nException to the rule: Katie Price aka Jordan and Peter Andre renewed their vows but so far remain happily married\n\nSome couples, on the other hand, recognise that their marriage has been on the slide for a while, have taken steps to repair it, and want to reaffirm their commitment in the presence of friends and family.\n\n\n\n'As a joint decision, this can have some merit: as an acknowledgement that the institution of marriage is more fragile today than it has ever been, which needs effort to make it work,' the psychologist adds.\n\n\n\nTo many happily-marrieds, the notion of vow-renewal may seem an alien one. It did to me.\n\n\n\n'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' was my gut reaction to my ex-husband's suggestion that we do it for our tenth wedding anniversary. I am ashamed to say that he twisted my arm - with a \u00a310,000 emerald and diamond bracelet to put on it.\n\nThe service took place on our anniversary at St Bride's Church in Fleet Street, where our original marriage had been blessed. Little did I know how broke our marriage was.\n\n\n\nA mere fortnight after the ceremony, he packed his bags and vanished one morning, without warning, while I was on the school run.\n\n\n\nMuch later, I discovered that my husband had fallen out of love with me, but couldn't bring himself (at that stage) to leave the children.\n\n\n\nHe tried desperately to repair things. But his insincere efforts were too little, and way too late.\n\n\n\nTake two: Many couples are now choosing to repeat the euphoria of their wedding day by renewing their vows\n\nAccording to the barrister who orchestrated my divorce, such extreme behaviour is actually quite common in spouses who have reached an emotional impasse and can no longer discern what they want.\n\n\n\nIt is certainly not uncommon from where I'm standing. Only days after re-saying their vows at a luxurious Indian Ocean retreat seven years ago, my pal Tess was devastated when her beloved Clive legged it with the resort's yoga instructor.\n\nMy friends Christine and Patrick didn't quite get that far: after months of preparation, Christine all but collapsed in their local church in front of family and friends when her husband stomped out yelling 'this is bloody ridiculous!' before the couple even made it to the altar.\n\n\n\nSo as a used and bruised survivor of vow-renewal, I'd say give this dangerous, expensive and ultimately pointless little diversion a swerve. You said the vows once: they didn't run out.\n\n\n\nThere are other ways of showing your partner how you feel. By all means re-say your vows in private, among yourselves, whenever you feel the need to.\n\n\n\nGoogle them if you've forgotten, print them out, stick them on the fridge with a couple of magnets: the ultimate food for thought. At least you won't wind up with egg on your face.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/20/07/104035469-0-image-a-6_1763624905623.jpg",
