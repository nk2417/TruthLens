I didn\u2019t see you there,\u201d Chastain intoned. Fallon giggled and mumbled something about being clumsy. Here, Chastain launched into a self-involved monologue.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to forgive me. I was lost in thought contemplating how small we are in this vast universe,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing but a speck of dust. The only thing that could give me purpose is somebody to grab onto and join me as I float through this endless world of confusion.\u201d\n\nFallon\u2019s single line: \u201cYeah.\u201d\n\nThe late night host then pointed out to Chastain, \u201cI barely got to speak there.\u201d\n\nThe two other faux movie scenes proved similar points, with Chastain taking the lead or carelessly dismissing Fallon\u2019s lines with a wave of her hand and a \u201cno thanks.\u201d\n\nTrending Stories Kevin Spacey Says He Has 'No Home' After Sexual Misconduct Allegations Brandi Carlile and Patty Loveless Pay Tribute to Vince Gill at 2025 CMA Awards 2025 CMA Awards: The Complete Winners List Neighbor Indicted in Murder of \u2018King of the Hill\u2019 Star Jonathan Joss\n\nChastain has been a vocal supporter of the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements. Last May, at the Cannes Film Festival, the actress spoke out about the problematically low female representation in film during a press conference following the festival\u2019s final ceremony.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve watched 20 films in 10 days, and I love movies, and the one thing I really took away from this experience is how the world views women from the female characters that I saw represented,\u201d Chastain said at the time. \u201cIt was quite disturbing to me, to be honest. There are some exceptions, I will say. But for the most part I was surprised by the representation of female characters on screen in these films, and I do hope that when we include more female storytellers we will have more of the women that I recognize in my day-to-day life. Ones who are proactive, have their own agency, don\u2019t just react to the men around them, they have their own point of view.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jessica-chastain-jimmy-fallon-4e6fa306-9f2e-4e02-8ab9-fb44bb8e6516.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jessica-chastain-jimmy-fallon-4e6fa306-9f2e-4e02-8ab9-fb44bb8e6516.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/jessica-chastain-shows-jimmy-fallon-what-its-like-to-have-a-female-role-253629/", "title": "Jessica Chastain Shows Jimmy Fallon What It\u2019s Like to Have a Female Role", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Jessica Chastain says women's parts have been \"so underwritten,\" champions \"better female representation\" in Hollywood", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Joyce Chen", "tags": "Jessica Chastain, Jimmy Fallon", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jessica Chastain Shows Jimmy Fallon What It's Like to Have a Female Role", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/jessica-chastain-shows-jimmy-fallon-what-its-like-to-have-a-female-role-253629/", "description": "Jessica Chastain says women's parts have been \"so underwritten,\" champions \"better female representation\" in Hollywood", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jessica-chastain-jimmy-fallon-4e6fa306-9f2e-4e02-8ab9-fb44bb8e6516.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "width": 1600, "height": 900, "alt": "Actress Jessica Chastain with host Jimmy Fallon during \" Role Swap\" on January 18, 2018"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-19T17:24:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T13:44:14+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jessica Chastain says women's parts have been \"so underwritten,\" champions \"better female representation\" in Hollywood", "site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jessica Chastain Shows Jimmy Fallon What It\u2019s Like to Have a Female Role", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jessica-chastain-jimmy-fallon-4e6fa306-9f2e-4e02-8ab9-fb44bb8e6516.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516382673.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
