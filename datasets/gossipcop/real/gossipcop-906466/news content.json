And daughter Leah, 9, (with ex Gary Shirley) is just as excited that boy will be joining the family. Shirley and his wife Kristina, however, have some reservations.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always said, like, that was on her Christmas list, she wanted a baby brother, she wanted a baby brother but she put it like from us\u201d Kristina told Shirley. \u201cI\u2019m like, you\u2019re not going to get a baby form us.

The series launched in December 2009 as the first spinoff from MTV\u2019s 16 and Pregnant. The debut season followed the lives of Maci Bookout, Catelynn Lowell, Amber Portwood and Farrah Abraham, who all experienced very different journeys during their teen pregnancies. On season 5, [\u2026]\n\nShirley agreed and mentioned Portwood\u2019s ex fiance Matt Baier, who she split with in August. \u201cShe\u2019s getting used to Andrew too. A lot of changes.

Before they were red-carpet regulars, NeNe Leakes, Jennifer Hudson, Julianne Hough and Lucy Hale were among those who broke through as reality stars\n\n\u201cWhen I first found out, I was a little scared,\u201d the 16 and Pregnant alum told Us that month. \u201cI just kind of sat down and thought about it and realized that it was a big step in my life and it was a good thing actually, and I was really happy within 30 minutes.\u201d\n\nPortwood and Glennon met in the summer of 2017 while she was filming Marriage Boot Camp with Baier.", "images":
