The superstar also managed to pull off eight outfit changes during the show \u2014 and each look was more glamorous than the next. Here, every detail about her on-stage style parade.\n\nWhen Clarkson stepped onto the red carpet in Las Vegas on Sunday night, the singer was dressed in a black custom Christian Siriano gown with a diagonal neckline, studded, structured shoulders a high slit and a black leather belt (above, center). She paired the design with strappy studded black sandals and a matching clutch, and topped off the look with a red lip.\n\nRob Latour/REX/Shutterstock; Frazer Harrison/Getty Images; Rob Latour/REX/Shutterstock\n\nNext, Clarkson sported a black pantsuit with a gold fringe tassel-embellished cape (above, left), also by Siriano. She layered the blazer, which grazed the floor, over a black jeweled bustier. Then came her performance look: a black-and-white striped Balmain dress (top right) with gold embellishments, which she paired with black stockings and black and gold boots.\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images(2); Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nFor her third Christian Siriano look of the night, Clarkson showed off her curves in a black metallic skin-tight dress (above left) and studded Christian Louboutin boots. She paired the look with gold earrings, nude makeup and straight hair.\n\nMoving on to her Versace moment, the singer changed into a black zip-up leather dress (above middle) from the Italian label, which included a motorcycle-style top and a tight, knee-length skirt. Again, she paired the look with black boots.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kelly Clarkson Is Tired of Telling Girls They Are Pretty: \u2018I Make a Point to Always Say Other Adjectives\u2019\n\nAnd as for one of her most over-the-top looks, she wore a gold sequined suit by Siriano (above right), complete with wide-leg pants and a ton of Studio 54 vibes.\n\nClarkson\u2019s stylist, Candice Lambert McAndrews, shared her all of her looks from on Instagram. \u201cWhat a night! You killed it Kelly Clarkson! I couldn\u2019t be prouder of you and our awesome team,\u201d she wrote. \u201c8 outfit changes, three performances\u2026hair and make up galore!!! We did it; Billboard awards smashed @gloglomakeup@robertramoshair @nailsbytsha @birta.h! Thank you\u2026to all the designers that worked with me on creating these looks\u2026especially @csiriano \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18, @versace @balmain\u201d\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images (2)\n\nBut her looks by Siriano didn\u2019t stop there. Clarkson wore a black blazer with gold chain-link detailing (above left) and a black skirt by the designer, and performed again in a gold fringed dress and a black belt (above right).\n\nLambert McAndrews recently opened up to PeopleStyle about what it\u2019s like collaborating with the star, explaining that they collaborate on her looks and try to expand their horizons with each ensemble.\n\n\u201cWith her album [Meaning of Life] she was very specific on the direction \u2014 black, with touches of gold, strong, sexy, feminine, soulful, pop. With The Voice she kind of lets me run with it,\u201d Lambert McAndrews tells PEOPLE. \u201cI present clothes and ideas for each show to her. We try them on and we go with what we both love the most. Each night we are trying a different vibe. It\u2019s so much fun.\u201d\n\nAnd when choosing looks for Clarkson, Lambert aims to find pieces that flatter her figure. \u201cShe has a beautiful figure and a small waist. I try to put her in outfits that fit her well; fit is the most important part, especially for curvy women.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI think the best way to dress her is to show off her body type, show off her curves and accentuate her body type.\u201d", "images":
