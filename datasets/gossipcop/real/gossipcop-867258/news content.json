The fans have lived through so many changes, and this is only a new, different one, not a fearful one.\"[19] Chibnall said that he always wanted a woman for the part and that Whittaker was their first choice.[21]\n\nReaction to Whittaker's casting was mostly positive, although a \"sizeable minority\" was unhappy.[22] Some said that a female Doctor would be a good role model for young girls, while others felt the Doctor was only ever meant to be male, or criticised the casting as an exercise in political correctness.[23][24]\n\nWhittaker debuted in the 2017 Christmas special \"Twice Upon a Time\" while her opening episode The Woman Who Fell to Earth is the highest viewed premiere episode of a debuting Doctor in the show's history with 10.96 million viewers.[25][26]\n\nIn November 2018, the BBC confirmed that the twelfth series, Whittaker's second series, began production.[27][28] Whittaker returned for the thirteenth series,[29] and also voiced the Doctor in the 2022 BBC Sounds podcast Doctor Who: Redacted.[30] She departed the programme following the series and three associated specials in 2022.[31] Whittaker generally received praise for her performance.[32][33][34][35][36] Though some felt the Thirteenth Doctor did little to combat social and political injustices,[37][38] others felt the era's storylines were too 'politically correct,' criticising what they saw as the show taking a more socially progressive outlook during Whittaker's tenure.[39]\n\nOn May 31, 2025, Whittaker made a surprise cameo, reprising her role as the Thirteenth Doctor in the Doctor Who series 15 finale \"The Reality War\", alongside Ncuti Gatwa as the Fifteenth Doctor.[40] Starting in July 2025, Whittaker reprised her role as the Thirteenth Doctor in a series of Doctor Who audio dramas from Big Finish Productions.\n\nIn February 2023, a press release indicated that Whittaker was filming for a six-part Australian drama series One Night for Paramount+.[41] The series was released on Paramount+ in Australia on 1 September 2023[42] and in the UK and Ireland on 24 November 2023.[43] In One Night, Whittaker played a rape victim.[44]\n\nIn April 2023, it was announced that Whittaker would star alongside Bella Ramsey and Siobhan Finneran in the second series of the BBC prison drama Time and that filming would start in the spring of 2023 in and around Liverpool.[45] The series premiered on BBC One in October 2023.[46]\n\nIn August 2023, Whittaker joined the main cast of the Netflix series Toxic Town, based on the Corby toxic waste case.[47] It was released on Netflix worldwide on February 27, 2025.[48]\n\nFrom October 2024 to December 2024, Whittaker starred in the West End stage play The Duchess.[49]\n\nIt was announced on 30 January 2025 that Whittaker and Suranne Jones would star in Frauds, a 6-part ITV art-heist series about 2 confidence trickster women.[50] The tv series premiered in the UK on ITV1 6 October 2025..[51]\n\nIt was announced on 7 July 2025 that Whittaker would star in Dear England, a 4-part BBC series adapted from a hit stage play about English football manager Gareth Southgate.
