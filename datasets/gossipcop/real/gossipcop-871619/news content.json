She taught me how to contour. I didn't even know what that was. She works with people on reality TV, so she knew that there wouldn't be a lot of sleeping, so she advised on buying a white or a nude eye liner to put on my eyes to make them look bigger, which I didn't even know was a thing. Then, a couple days before filming, I went to Sephora and bought foundation, eye shadow palettes, brow fillers, like every single thing you could ever imagine. That was fun and expensive, but it was worth it.\n\nDid the makeup artist's tricks help you out?\n\nI think I screwed up. Of course the first day, you're thinking, \"Oh my god. This is so exciting. I'm going to wake up and put makeup on.\" Then, as the time goes on, I just kind of got lazier and lazier. Now, people recognize me more in public when I'm not wearing makeup than when I am. That's probably a sign that I should have tried a little bit harder the whole time when it came to doing my makeup every morning. But you get comfortable. The cameras are just there all the time, so you don't even think about looking pretty.\n\nHow long did people take in the morning to do their makeup?\n\nIt wasn't a set amount of time. I just slapped on mascara and foundation and called it a day. But there were a lot of people who would take 30 minutes to and hour to do their hair and their makeup.\n\nWhat beauty moments do we not see on TV?\n\nWe were so bored all day. There was so much downtime. We were always doing beauty routines because that was literally all we had time to do. There were so many days where we did a lot of mud masks and self-tanning sessions. We were painting our nails all the time because we were constantly changing outfits, and we wanted match the nails to the outfit. There was a lot of beauty and pampering for each other that never really gets aired.\n\nAshley Iaconetti", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/6916343ca33473dcfd6aac43/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd4f529e1b43b4607296f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/bachelor-contestants.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/589cfc0eb02f3ebc310e2e2a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/pinnable-Bachelor-Beauty-Confessions.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6904c1f810c91f09f41c3298/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/69012b54edd71d55107a009b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/68f2cb864684234b8149e657/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/691cd61d68f5312686793e55/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/690cc01e66ddff16cb311bd3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6908db9e6df9c40528ad1e6b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/69090947ab06a81174040a32/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/69023dfbd34605d4d763f127/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/68fb97fea6008a82c6ee2ce9/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6902d589d809c1c9f998cc4e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/68f918f33483d028b7813ebf/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/624493d6b5d3d31ccdd63da0/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd4f529e1b43b4607296f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/bachelor-contestants.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Devon Abelman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/bachelor-contestant-beauty-secret-confessions", "title": "These 5 Bachelor Beauty Secrets From Former Contestants Will Kinda Blow Your Mind", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Devon Abelman", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "We chatted with some of our favorite ladies from past seasons to learn some Bachelor beauty secrets and tips.", "id": "577199b82554df47220a5779", "keywords": "celebrity trends,celebrities,catherine giudici,ashlet iaconetti,jillian harris,sarah herron,courtney robertson,olivia caridi,pinterest,the bachelor,the bachelorette", "news_keywords": "celebrity trends,celebrities,catherine giudici,ashlet iaconetti,jillian harris,sarah herron,courtney robertson,olivia caridi,pinterest,the bachelor,the bachelorette", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "577199b82554df47220a5779", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"We chatted with some of our favorite ladies from past seasons to learn some Bachelor beauty secrets and tips.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd1b4d8952dae4dc100f9/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-01-18%20at%203.33.54%20PM.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd1b4d8952dae4dc100f9/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-01-18%20at%203.33.54%20PM.png\"}", "og": {"description": "All we needed was a one-on-one date with some of our favorite ladies.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd4f529e1b43b4607296f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/bachelor-contestants.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "These Beauty Secrets From Past Bachelor Contestants Are Actually Jaw Dropping", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/bachelor-contestant-beauty-secret-confessions"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2015-07-27T00:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-01-19T14:00:00.000Z", "author": "Devon Abelman"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "All we needed was a one-on-one date with some of our favorite ladies.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd4f529e1b43b4607296f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/bachelor-contestants.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "These Beauty Secrets From Past Bachelor Contestants Are Actually Jaw Dropping"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd4f529e1b43b4607296f/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/bachelor-contestants.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1437955200.0, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
