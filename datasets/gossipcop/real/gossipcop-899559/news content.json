Great news for her, but if she doesn't win next month, it would stretch the show's dismal Globes record to 0-30.\n\nDespite being one of three shows where the main stars have all won Emmy Awards, the NBC comedy is the biggest TV loser at the Globes. \"Will & Grace\" amassed 27 nominations and zero wins when it was first on the air from 1998 to 2006. Last year, it added two more nominations, for Best TV Comedy/Musical Series and Best TV Comedy/Musical Actor for Eric McCormack, to bring its record to 0-29. To their credit, the stars have had a good sense of humor about it, often toasting on the Globes when their names weren't announced.\n\nSEE Golden Globes 2019: Full list of nominations\n\nMessing received six nominations during the comedy's original run (she also has two nominations for \"The Starter Wife\"). She wasn't expected to earn a nomination this year, sitting in ninth place in our predictions. But Messing received glowing reviews last month for her powerful performance in \"Will & Grace\"'s #MeToo episode, in which Grace (Messing) revealed to her father Martin (Robert Klein) that his late friend had sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager.\n\nWill this finally be \"Will & Grace\"'s year? Messing's nomination was the only one for the series, and she's up against two people, Kristen Bell (\"The Good Place\") and Rachel Brosnahan (\"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\"), whose shows are nominated for the top prize, with the latter being the reigning champ. Her other rivals are returning nominee Alison Brie (\"GLOW\") and another comedienne in a revival, Candice Bergen (\"Murphy Brown\"), who won in 1989 and 1992 for the original.\n\nSIGN UP for Gold Derby\u2019s free newsletter with latest predictions", "images": ["https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/avatars/9416/577bfa6a8785e-bpfull.jpg?w=0&crop=0px%2C0px%2C250px%2C250px&resize=32%2C32&strip=info", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/177345_0956_V1.jpg?w=3000&h=2000&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Ethan-Hawke-Jeremy-Allen-White.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Wednesday_Ep_206_ref_stills_206_017_080_Tone_Mapped_100-nit_BT_709_01_20250806RC.jpg?w=3000&h=1944&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Magnet-Smash-Christy.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-3fYA_jjXdhqZ-&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/P1036HZS.jpg?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1402665881-joyce-eng-200-x-250-bpfull.webp?w=200&h=250&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TBCM5869_y7ixqyMG.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DA__5306.jpg?w=3000&h=2912&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/messing.jpg?w=620", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sinners-kpop-demon-hunters.png?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Sharon-and-Ozzy-Osbourne-On-the-couch-with-the-dogs-c-Ruaridh-Connellan-002.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Copy-of-Still-1.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/dwts-robert-irwin_9a2f6b.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/messing.jpg?w=620&h=360&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TCDTASK_HO020.jpg?w=1920&h=1280&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/MVW.png?resize=232,175", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TCDBLRA_EC017.jpg?w=3000&h=1500&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2552_D085_00216R_561660.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/sinners-kpop-demon-hunters.png?w=300&h=168&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/messing.jpg?w=620", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Eng"], "canonical_link": "https://www.goldderby.com/tv/2018/will-and-grace-golden-globes-nomination-losing-streak-0-30-debra-messing/", "title": "\u2018Will & Grace\u2019 could extend its Golden Globes losing streak to 0-30", "meta_data": {"description": "Debra Messing received a Golden Globe nomination for \"Will &amp; Grace,\" which is the Globes' biggest TV loser.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Joyce Eng", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Will & Grace\u2019 could extend its Golden Globes losing streak to 0-30", "url": "https://www.goldderby.com/tv/2018/will-and-grace-golden-globes-nomination-losing-streak-0-30-debra-messing/", "description": "Debra Messing received a Golden Globe nomination for \"Will & Grace,\" which is the Globes' biggest TV loser.", "site_name": "Gold Derby", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/messing.jpg?w=620", "width": 620, "height": 360, "alt": "Robert Klein and Debra Messing, Will & Grace"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-12-06T18:45:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-12-06T18:45:14+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Debra Messing received a Golden Globe nomination for \"Will & Grace,\" which is the Globes' biggest TV loser.", "site": "@GoldDerby", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Will & Grace\u2019 could extend its Golden Globes losing streak to 0-30", "image": "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/messing.jpg?w=620"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.goldderby.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-gd_favicon-1.png?w=270", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/RdtkTdONCGA?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1544121914.0, "source": "https://www.goldderby.com", "summary": ""}
