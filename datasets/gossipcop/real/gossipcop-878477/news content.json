In September 2014, he organized the Invictus Games, a charity event for wounded combat veterans named after the 1875 William Ernest Henley poem schoolboys in England once had to memorize, with the famous lines \u201cI am the master of my fate / I am the captain of my soul.\u201d When Harry turned 30, he inherited $16 million from the estate of his mother, Princess Diana, and that is when he determined to spend his time and efforts supporting veterans with physical and psychological injuries.\n\nAs Diana\u2019s younger son, Harry continues to bask in the public\u2019s love for \u201cthe People\u2019s Princess.\u201d He has been forgiven his occasional wildness, his drift, the acting out of a broken heart that had sent him into grief counseling in his late 20s. As the royal favorite, there is keen interest in\u2014and much speculation about\u2014the woman he may marry. A rumor floating in cyberspace has that he popped the question last month when they were vacationing in Botswana.\n\nAs in the 1957 Marilyn Monroe-Laurence Olivier film, The Prince and the Showgirl, a feeding frenzy surrounds royal-and-nonroyal couplings. Though Markle is extremely pretty and she stars in a TV show, you would never call her a \u201cshowgirl.\u201d She is too serious, too well brought up. (And outside of Vegas, who\u2019s called a \u201cshowgirl\u201d anymore?) \u201cGrounded\u201d is the word that is often used to describe her.\n\n\u201cI was born and raised in Los Angeles, a California girl who lives by the ethos that most things can be cured with either yoga, the beach, or a few avocados,\u201d she once wrote. Until recently, she maintained a popular lifestyle blog called The Tig. She is a self-described foodie, a passion, incidentally, given to her character on Suits. \u201cI mean, this bread is so good!\u201d she enthuses over the delicious meal she prepared. \u201cIt\u2019s that perfect crunch and then the softness. They call it the \u2018crumb,\u2019 all of these little holes\u2014oh!\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fa686659389b4cea701e19/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691cd91f9f3eb60315ac3531/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96825106117712f34f887/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69161589683a0692afe31872/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5908b35e16779f27abc0a375/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/t-meghan-markle-style.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96825e025da666cd492e9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e55b2c48e51f42566b396/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5824deca364154776b0ba9d3/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/t-kate-middleton-meghan-markle.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a968264ef611786ce8c2e1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-meghan-markle-10-17-cover.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96825e025da666cd492e7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-10-17-cover.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690bcf4cd862d6f327955a94/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96825f472d37f5e2f7265/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a968254a3663211bf43089/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690a5ee0da787343f1849201/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6903bca7d353cca0e86410a6/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69029073963ccd75d51829af/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690a2457c9b01443eb632273/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69133facb7897d9e50eef0da/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96826600c2752b9cb62d3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss05.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a968264ef611786ce8c2e1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-meghan-markle-10-17-cover.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Kashner", "Peter Lindbergh", "Jessica Diehl"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/09/meghan-markle-cover-story", "title": "Cover Story: Meghan Markle, Wild About Harry!", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Sam Kashner", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Battered by the tabloids\u2014to the point where her boyfriend, Prince Harry, issued a statement defending her\u2014actress and activist Meghan Markle has largely ignored the media storm.
