{"url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/the-queer-eye-guys-friendship-tests-video", "text": "If you've seen even one episode of the new Queer Eye reboot on Netflix, then you know how much the Fab Five\u2014Jonathan Van Ness (grooming), Antoni Porowski (food), Tan France (style), Karamo Brown (culture), and Bobby Berk (design)\u2014love each other. Their friendship chemistry is off the charts onscreen because it's so genuine. In between helping the \"heroes\" (or contestants) from each episode, these five guys laugh, joke around, and open up to each other in ways that you do only with friends you've known for years. For more proof of their bond, just head on over to their Instagram pages, where they're always leaving each other sweet comments and compliments.\n\nSo when the Fab Five stopped by Glamour's office a few weeks back, of course we wanted to talk about their tight-knit relationship\u2014and their quotes didn't disappoint. \"[Antoni] is someone who really shows up for me, like, anytime I need him\u2026. He totally just lets me be myself,\" Jonathan said about Antoni during our interview. \"Jonathan inspires me to be more OK with being me,\" Bobby said about Jonathan just a few minutes later. You feel that? That's your tear ducts welling up because all of this is just so tender.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/691cb60c2073c4f892a30a3e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690130491e26b96538751967/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691787f6b48835f1928be9a4/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68fac442f289c13dd3caac6a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_image.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_640%2Cq_80%2Cw_640/v1761507249/glamour_we-need-to-talk-ms-rachel-tied-to-woty.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68d748296ae85e2583754946/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5fc7ac2acea2c24a2fe46438/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68fa94268b4d1b984ef3ef23/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690a89ef696935a70973f69a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68f6a2c10d39c73d933a2121/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/glamour-banner-v2.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/logo-oneNav.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/69020b93d026e28178c5745e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68f664cd5f94c2344cf184a8/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b324c8a4451e155fb87f7b3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/queer-eye.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b324c8a4451e155fb87f7b3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/queer-eye.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher Rosa"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/the-queer-eye-guys-friendship-tests-video", "title": "The Queer Eye Guys Did a Bunch of Friendship Exercises, and It's Honestly So Tender", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Christopher Rosa", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "The 'Queer Eye' guys stopped by our offices a few weeks ago, and we had them do trust exercises.
