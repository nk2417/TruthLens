See photos sure to induce some '90s nostalgia.\n\nThe actress, who played lovable movie heroine Cher Horowitz, took Bear, 7, to a screening of the movie at an L.A. cemetery. \u201cThere were 4,000 people and this huge screen outdoors at night, in a cemetery, very romantic, and there were pillows and ros\u00e9,\u201d Silverstone, 42, recalled during a Monday, June 11, appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.\n\nBear didn\u2019t walk away singing \u201cRollin\u2019 With the Homies.\u201d Or quoting classic lines from the film. Instead he tried to make out with his mom. \u201cThe one thing he took away from it, aside from all the things I was worried about, was he kept trying to French kiss me afterwards, which was very sweet,\u201d the American Woman actress explained.\n\nRelated: \u201890s Stars: Then and Now From Carson Daly to Devon Sawa, Candace Cameron Bure to Christine Taylor, see where some of the hottest stars from the \u201890s are now!\n\n\u201cAnd you said, \u2019That is not appropriate?\u2019\u201d asked Colbert.\n\n\u201cI just kept my mouth closed,\u201d she replied. \u201cThat\u2019s what I did.
