THANK U to those who have helped to make a difference! #AlexandriaHouse.\u201d\n\nThe hourlong episode focused almost entirely on Kim\u2019s mission to raise awareness about the issue of homelessness, starting with a drive through Skid Row with sisters Khlo\u00e9, 33, and Kourtney, 38.\n\n\u201cI am just at a point in my life where I don\u2019t want to be naive anymore,\u201d admitted Kim, 37. \u201cAnd I want to use my platform to get other people involved. \u2026 I just hope that I can shine a light on this issue, and hopefully more people will come together and we can figure out a solution for this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the answer is to get people off the streets, but I\u2019m so willing to help in any way that I can,\u201d she continued. \u201cI just want to bring awareness to this issue. It makes me feel really sad that people are just living like this, and the problem is getting worse.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 and Kim met with the staff at Union Rescue Mission, one of the largest rescue missions of its kind in the United States and the oldest in L.A., where they learned that there are around 47,000 homeless people in the area with just 12,000 shelter beds to go around. (More recent statistics point to an even higher number of affected individuals: 58,000.)\n\nLater, Kim met with councilwoman Nury Martinez, who has focused much of her career on helping the homeless. Together, Kim and Martinez drove around the city as Martinez pointed out the many homeless encampments, all littered with trash and debris. Kim called the situation \u201cheartbreaking.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know that this is not something that I can fix by myself,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I hope that everything that I\u2019m learning will hopefully wake something up in other people.\u201d\n\nDeciding to focus their efforts on women and children, Kim and her team organized a party at the Alexandria House. They partnered with companies to provide a range of products and services, such as money management coaching and r\u00e9sum\u00e9 workshopping.\n\nSeveral women who have been supported by the Alexandria House also got the chance to tell their stories and share their experiences with homelessness, including a former athlete who was kicked out of the house at 17.\n\n\u201cThere are so many circumstances that can lead to this situation for so many people \u2014 this could happen to anyone,\u201d Kim reflected. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to understand that not everyone on the street is a drug addict.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (8 p.m. ET) on E!", "images":
