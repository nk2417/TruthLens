{"url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/11/christopher-plummer-kevin-spacey-all-the-money-in-the-world", "text": "On November 8, word broke that Ridley Scott planned to re-shoot several scenes in his upcoming fact-based hostage thriller, All the Money in the World, in order to excise the scandal-plagued Kevin Spacey from the film\u2014even though Scott still intends to release the movie December 22. Less than a week later, even the actor replacing Spacey\u2014Christopher Plummer\u2014is still reeling from the news.\n\nThe sudden swap and race against time is a welcome challenge for Plummer, he said\u2014but the veteran actor also feels \u201cawfully sad\u201d for Spacey, given the snowballing sexual-misconduct allegations against the House of Cards star.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very sad what happened to him. Kevin is such a talented and a terrifically gifted actor, and it\u2019s so sad. It\u2019s such a shame,\u201d Plummer told Vanity Fair at the premiere of his latest film, The Man Who Invented Christmas, in New York on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can say, because that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nPlummer, who turns 88 a week before the release of All the Money, said he received a call from Scott offering him the part last week. The Sound of Music star did not have trepidation in taking on the role of billionaire J. Paul Getty, he said, despite the circumstances.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6912302be09f2aa2f0d4b6ab/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined",
