{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_%26_Order:_Special_Victims_Unit_(season_1)", "text": "Season of American television series (1999\u20132000)\n\nSeason of television series\n\nThe first season of the crime drama television series Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, premiered on September 20, 1999 on NBC and concluded on May 19, 2000. Created by Dick Wolf, it is the first spin-off of Law & Order and follows the detectives of a fictionalized version of the New York City Police Department's Special Victims Unit, which investigates sexually based offenses. SVU originally aired on Monday nights at 9pm/8c EST, but it was moved to Friday nights at 10pm/9c after the ninth episode. Showrunner Robert Palm felt too disturbed by the subject matter and left after the season's conclusion.[1]\n\nThe season has been well-received, with critics praising its captivating narratives and memorable characters. The Law & Order: Special Victims Unit first season DVD box set was released on October 21, 2003, in Region 1 format.[2]\n\nEpisodes [ edit ]\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nDevelopment [ edit ]\n\nDick Wolf is the creator and executive producer of this series.\n\nInspiration for the series came from a 1986 murder in Central Park committed by Robert Emmet Chambers whose strategy in court was to sexualize the victim.[25] The season one episode of Law & Order, \"Kiss the Girls and Make Them Die\" is based on this case. Dick Wolf wanted to continue exploring similar themes in a dedicated legal drama and hired Ted Kotcheff and Robert Palm as executive producers of the new series, as well as Jean de Segonzac, the franchise director for Law & Order. Robert Palm was previously an executive producer on Law & Order and was the first person to use the term \"mothership\" to distinguish the original from its spin-offs.[26] This phrase has become popular with fans of the franchise.\n\nUnlike the original Law & Order, filming for SVU began in North Bergen, New Jersey since there was not enough real estate available to get a studio in Manhattan. The production staff were still told to think of the area as being Manhattan.[27] As with Law & Order, writers for the series primarily worked in Los Angeles. However, SVU featured more female writers with the series aiming to bring a \"strong woman's perspective\" to the screen.[26] Writer Dawn DeNoon has mentioned that many of the writing staff were fired during the first season because their scripts were not up to par.[1]\n\nCasting [ edit ]\n\nFor the lead roles, Christopher Meloni was cast as Detective Elliot Stabler and Mariska Hargitay was cast as Detective Olivia Benson after they auditioned together.[28] Hargitay, who had to move from Los Angeles to New York when she got the role, said she was able to do this on short notice because she was already planning on moving to New York to pursue a Broadway career.[29] The squad commander role was filled by Dann Florek, who had portrayed Captain Don Cragen for the first three seasons on the original Law & Order and later reprised his role in Exiled: A Law & Order Movie. He joined the cast on the condition that he not be asked to audition.[1] Richard Belzer was cast as Detective John Munch, continuing his role from the series Homicide: Life on the Street. In Belzer's words, he was cast because \"Dick Wolf and Tom Fontana got drunk at a party\".[30] Halfway through the season, Richard Belzer reprised his role of Munch in Homicide: The Movie, which briefly shows his character out on a case in his SVU context in New York. At Belzer's insistence, his character was partnered with Brian Cassidy, who was portrayed by Dean Winters. However, Winters' contractual obligation to the HBO series Oz forced him to leave halfway through the season. Michelle Hurd, who portrayed Detective Monique Jeffries, filled Winters' void for the remainder of the season, and was at that point added to the main credits.[31][32]\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nMain [ edit ]\n\nRecurring [ edit ]\n\nGuest stars [ edit ]\n\nJennifer Esposito played reporter Sarah Logan, a rape victim who is also targeted by a stalker.\n\nThe first season featured the highest number of crossover appearances in SVU. Angie Harmon portrayed her Law & Order character ADA Abbie Carmichael for six episodes. Jerry Orbach (Det. Lennie Briscoe) and his new partner Jesse L. Martin (Det. Ed Green) were shown working together in the third episode. Almost the entire cast of the original series appeared in the crossover episode \"Entitled.\" Another character establishing ties to the original was Detective Ken Briscoe, the nephew of Lennie Briscoe. He was played by Chris Orbach, the son of Jerry Orbach. The younger Orbach later said that he had mixed feelings about his role on the show, as he felt he \"only got the gig because of [his] old man.\"[33] Years after that, he'd admit to friends that he was simply very nervous on set about living up to his dad, and felt out of his depth.\n\nFamily members of both lead detectives appeared in the opening episode. Kathy Stabler, Elliot Stabler's wife, was played by Isabel Gillies. Gillies continued to play Kathy Stabler over the course of the next 11 years either as a guest star or a recurring actress. She recalled that she was in the middle of buying a wedding dress when she got the call to be on SVU.[27] Elizabeth Ashley was cast to play Serena Benson, Olivia's mother. Serena Benson did not appear in SVU again but was mentioned several times. Her character's history of being a rape victim who never got justice\u2014and whose attacker was Olivia's biological father\u2014figures in many later episodes.\n\nAndrew McCarthy guest starred as Randolph Morrow, a sadistic rapist who keeps a sex slave locked in his room.\n\nSome of the earliest revelations about Detective Benson's personal life are found in \"Stalked.\" In this episode, Bruce Kirkpatrick played a rapist who decides to intimidate the detectives once he learns that he is under investigation. An episode dealing with mental illness, \"The Third Guy,\" featured a guest performance by Denis O'Hare. He played an intellectually disabled rapist who elicits differing opinions in the SVU.\n\nThe episode \"Closure\" aired shortly before Detective Brian Cassidy left the Special Victims Unit. However, because of its nonlinear storytelling, it portrayed Cassidy as still working for the unit months later. Despite the continuity error, the producers decided to revisit this episode in the second season owing to the cliffhanger ending and Tracy Pollan's well-received performance as Harper Anderson, a rape victim who becomes obsessed with taking revenge on her attacker. She was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series.[34]\n\nReiko Aylesworth was one of the actresses who originally auditioned for the role of Olivia Benson.[28] Instead, she was cast as Assistant District Attorney Erica Alden, whom she played in the last three episodes of the season. In the season's penultimate episode, \"Nocturne,\" Kent Broadhurst played Lawrence Holt, a piano teacher who molests his students. Wilson Jermaine Heredia played Evan, Holt's student and victim, who knows more about Holt's crimes than he lets on.[35]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nThe first season of this series received generally positive reviews from critics, though some noted that it took time for the series to establish a distinct identity separate from its parent series, Law & Order. Early praise centered on the show\u2019s willingness to confront sensitive and often taboo subjects related to sexual crimes and victimization, themes that were relatively uncommon on network television at the time. Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni were frequently commended for their strong performances and compelling on-screen chemistry, which helped to anchor the series emotionally and differentiate it from the more procedural tone of Law & Order.[36][37] Critics also highlighted the show\u2019s more character-driven approach, particularly in exploring the psychological toll such cases take on the detectives.\n\nOn Rotten Tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 84% with an average score of 7.5 out of 10 based on 43 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \u201cSpecial Victims Unit often blurs the line between socially conscious and exploitative, but Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni's terse chemistry adds a dimension of personality to the absorbing Law & Order formula.[38] Metacritic gave the season a score a weighted average based on the impression of 22 critical reviews\u2014of 68 signifying generally favorable reviews.[39] The pilot episode was generally well received, and Caryn James of The New York Times said that \"the show swiftly finds its balance. Not every series lends itself to cloning, but the essential qualities of Law and Order seem made for it: headline-generated stories resolved in self-contained episodes; a no-nonsense tone; a cast large enough to vary the focus.\"[40]\n\nBruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly said that season one was \"refreshingly dark-hearted alternative\" and that it was \"top-heavy with lightweight dramedies\".[41] Joyce Millman of Salon.com said the season was \"melodramatic and manipulative, splattered with awkward attempts at comedy\", then she criticized the season progression, proclaiming \"simultaneously soggy and crisp not an appealing combination however you slice it\".[42] Phil Gallo of Variety critiqued the portrayal of Detective Brian Cassidy in early SVU, describing him as \u2018an irksome single note\u2019 who seemed underwritten in the ensemble mix.[43] New York Magazine\u2019s John Leonard highlighted the show\u2019s tonal shift toward psychological complexity in the Season 1 finale, noting the team's involvement in investigating a human-slavery case\u2014and hinting at internal unit turmoil: \u201ceven as they are being evaluated for stress\u2026 find themselves investigating\u2026 a case of human slavery\u2026 a cliffhanger, in that we won\u2019t learn until next fall which member of the unit needs shrink\u2011wrapping\".[44]\n\nRatings [ edit ]\n\nThe first season's ratings were consistently medium, ranking #33 in its time-slot and leading its closest competition by 12.8 million viewers per episode, making it one of NBC's top-rated shows of the year. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds a rating of 75% based on critic reviews, praising the performances and the series's bold approach to sensitive topics.[45] Law & Order: Special Victims Unit premiered during the 1999\u20132000 United States television season, initially airing on NBC on Mondays at 9:00 p.m. before moving to Fridays at 10:00 p.m. after the ninth episode. According to the Nielsen ratings system, the season achieved an average household rating of 8.8 with a 15% share, ranking 33rd among all primetime shows for that television year.
