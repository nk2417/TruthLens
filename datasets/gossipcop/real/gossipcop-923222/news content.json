News Harry has quit cigarettes, although an insider is keen to state that he was never a \u201cfull time\u201d smoker.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe smoked socially, but as he doesn\u2019t go out as much anymore, he naturally lost interest in smoking,\u201d spilled a source.\n\n\n\nThe former soldier is also said to have upped his fitness regime.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was already in good shape when he met Meghan but the two of them enjoy healthy living together. They eat sensibly, his diet is very clean and ahead of the wedding, he is working out five times a week with a personal trainer,\u201d a source shared.\n\n\n\n\u201cMeghan doesn\u2019t follow as strict an exercise regime but focuses mostly on yoga. She does, however, also go to the gym sometimes.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nBritain's Prince Harry and fianc\u00e9e Meghan Markle visited Northern Ireland today pic.twitter.com/tqHpMMCwtM \u2014 RT\u00c9 News
