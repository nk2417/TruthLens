She started pushing and kicking when the deputies determined probable cause for the domestic battery and they were attempting to arrest her,\u201d Capt. Garo Kuredjian told The News.\n\nThe deputies did not observe any injuries on Locklear, but the \u201cDynasty\u201d star claimed she was hurt and visited a hospital before she was booked and released on bail, officials said.\n\nCops did not identify the boyfriend. Locklear was publicly dating former high school sweetheart Chris Heisser, 56, at the time.\n\nHeisser was arrested for DUI shortly after Locklear\u2019s arrest.\n\nLocklear was previously arrested in 2008 on suspicion of driving under the influence. She pleaded to a lesser charge of reckless driving and was sentenced to probation.\n\nThe \u201cT. J. Hooker\u201d actress was one of the biggest TV stars of the 1980s and early 90s and twice married famous rock musicians.\n\nShe was hitched to Motley Crue drummer Tommy Lee from 1986 to 1993 and Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora from 1994 to 2007.\n\nHer engagement to fellow \u201cMelrose Place\u201d star Jack Wagner hit the rocks in 2011. The couple had a post-breakup battle in December 2011 that generated a police report but no criminal charges.", "images": ["data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/04/12/PBEVMJYJJ2HIPGG3342IHSTUBM.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/New_York_Daily_News_nydredblack-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/04/12/PBEVMJYJJ2HIPGG3342IHSTUBM.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nancy Dillon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/04/12/heather-locklear-pleads-not-guilty-to-attacking-police-officers-in-february/", "title": "Heather Locklear pleads not guilty to attacking police officers in February", "meta_data": {"application-name": "newyorkdailynews", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Nancy Dillon", "canonical": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/04/12/heather-locklear-pleads-not-guilty-to-attacking-police-officers-in-february/"}, "description": "Heather Locklear pleaded not guilty to charges she kicked and shoved deputies who responded to a call of possible domestic violence.", "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Heather Locklear pleads not guilty to attacking police officers in February", "url": "https://www.nydailynews.com/2018/04/12/heather-locklear-pleads-not-guilty-to-attacking-police-officers-in-february/", "description": "Heather Locklear pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges she kicked and shoved Ventura County Sheriff\u2019s deputies who responded to a call of possible domestic violence at her California residen\u2026", "site_name": "New York Daily News", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/04/12/PBEVMJYJJ2HIPGG3342IHSTUBM.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "width": 1024, "height": 670}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-12T18:36:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-12T22:45:53+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "Heather Locklear pleads not guilty to attacking police officers in February"}, "image": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/04/12/PBEVMJYJJ2HIPGG3342IHSTUBM.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.nydailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/cropped-DailyNewsCamera-7.webp?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523558164.0, "source": "https://www.nydailynews.com", "summary": ""}
