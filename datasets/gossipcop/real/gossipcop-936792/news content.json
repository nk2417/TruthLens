The movie wasn\u2019t good \u2013 in fact, it was kind of terrible. But like all good TV movies, that made it even more fun to watch.\n\nNaturally, Netflix commissioned a sequel: \u201cA Christmas Prince: The Royal Wedding,\u201d which started streaming Friday. Here\u2019s everything you need to know:\n\n1. The main players are back \u2013 for the most part\n\nFor those who can\u2019t remember, the gist of the original \u201cA Christmas Prince\u201d: A frustrated New York journalist named Amber (Rose McIver of The CW\u2019s \u201ciZombie\u201d) arrived in the lovely country of Aldovia, determined to get a scoop that would impress her editors and finally get her a promotion. Amber\u2019s task was to report on Prince Richard (also known as \u201cHis Royal Hotness,\u201d played by Ben Lamb of \u201cThe White Queen\u201d), who might abdicate the throne after his father\u2019s death and throw the whole country into chaos.\n\nAmber was mistaken for Richard\u2019s younger sister\u2019s tutor, so she found herself with the undercover scoop of a lifetime. Naturally, she wound up falling for Richard (because that\u2019s what female journalists do in movies), and he was very hurt when he found out her true identity. But then everything was fine. He forgave her. And Richard became king and proposed to Amber; if you don\u2019t fall in love and get engaged in about 72 hours in these movies, you\u2019re doing something wrong.\n\nAnyway, nearly everyone has returned: Amber; Richard; Richard\u2019s little sister, Emily; Richard\u2019s mother, Queen Helena; Richard\u2019s troublemaking cousin, Simon, etc. However, Amber\u2019s father has been recast \u2013 and outfitted with a much campier personality, playing up his Brooklyn roots and being an extremely embarrassing dad as Amber tries to impress the royals.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna burn the house down, kiddo!\u201d he says jubilantly as he first arrives at the palace.\n\nAmber hurries to assure the royal family: \u201cHe didn\u2019t mean that literally.\u201d\n\n2. There\u2019s really no need to catch up on the first movie\n\nWithout giving all the \u201cplot\u201d details away, we can assure you that if you missed the first \u201cA Christmas Prince,\u201d you probably won\u2019t have a difficult time catching up. The 90-minute sequel takes place exactly a year after the last movie ended, as the palace is in a frenzy for Richard and Amber\u2019s coming wedding on Christmas Day.\n\nHowever, there are some dark subplots: The country of Aldovia is in a financial crisis. Amber suddenly realizes that yes, becoming a member of a royal family means your entire life belongs to them. Oh, and Princess Emily\u2019s Christmas play is briefly in trouble, though that jam is particularly low-stakes.\n\n3. There are a few callbacks\n\nFor die-hard fans, you\u2019ll recognize more than a few elements. Some plot points are repeated: For example, Amber\u2019s bossy wedding planner steals a cab at the airport, just as Richard stole Amber\u2019s cab last time. Amber\u2019s dad makes her favorite menu items from his diner, a \u201cConey Island Bloodhound\u201d (a hot dog) and a \u201cBlonde With Sand\u201d (coffee with cream and sugar).\n\nPlus, the movie writers were definitely listening to all of the ways that people made fun of the original. Amber was employed at the magazine \u201cNow Beat,\u201d a name that received plenty of mockery \u2013 or was it \u201cBeat Now\u201d? No one on the internet could tell. In the sequel, there\u2019s similar confusion, as Amber and her former co-workers talk about how \u201cNow Beat\u201d folded.\n\n\u201cNow Beat?\u201d Amber said, and then definitively answered: \u201cIt was Beat Now.\u201d\n\n4. There are some parallels to real-life royals\n\nCoincidentally or not, Amber has a few things in common with Meghan Markle, also an American marrying into a royal family. Similar to Markle, Amber has a blog, albeit with the uncreative title \u201cAmber\u2019s Blog.\u201d A major theme in the movie is how all sorts of people are worrying about Amber breaking \u201cprotocol,\u201d because she doesn\u2019t want to lose her own identity. We have a feeling this might sound familiar to some new members of the real-life palace.\n\nOriginally appeared in the Washington Post", "images": ["data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2560px-Chicago_Tribune_Logo.svg-1.png", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/chicago-tribune-logo-basic.jpeg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/chicago-tribune-logo-basic.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Washington Post"], "canonical_link": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2018/12/05/what-to-know-about-netflixs-a-christmas-prince-the-royal-wedding-the-sequel-to-last-years-viral-hit/", "title": "What to know about Netflix\u2019s \u2018A Christmas Prince: The Royal Wedding,\u2019 the sequel to last year\u2019s viral hit", "meta_data": {"application-name": "chicagotribune", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Washington Post", "canonical": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2018/12/05/what-to-know-about-netflixs-a-christmas-prince-the-royal-wedding-the-sequel-to-last-years-viral-hit/"}, "description": "It is quite difficult to keep track of all the cheesy, made-for-television holiday movies released this time of year \u2013 but it certainly helps if one of them goes viral.
