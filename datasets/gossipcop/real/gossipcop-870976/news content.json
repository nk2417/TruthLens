There are also wall renderings of Kurt Cobain eating pizza and the Beastie Boys standing in front of a local pizzeria.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been seeing that big blank wall from the 101 and thought it would be good for something,\u201d says Never, who also created the Dave Grohl mural which adorns the eatery\u2019s front. \u201cWhen I heard Chester died, I immediately thought of that wall because I knew some of the band members lived in the Valley. I just texted Jim and offered to do it for free because it was the right thing to do.\u201d\n\nThe looming portrait of Bennington shows him at peace, rather than the intense, animated figure he was on-stage.\n\n\u201cI stumbled across this publicity still of him, smiling, very recognizable, with all his tattoos visible,\u201d Never explains. \u201cI thought it would be better than having him up there screaming.\u201d\n\nNever compares his mix of street culture, fine art, and 1950s advertisements to Linkin Park\u2019s musical hybrid. His goal for his series of memorial murals is to create a site-specific tribute for community icons \u2013 his work includes pieces for Elliott Smith in Silver Lake, Tupac Shakur in South Central, and Sublime in Long Beach.\n\nAs someone whose subjects include \u201cmusic, movies, and sports,\u201d Never\u2019s work includes a Stuart Scott \u201cBoo Ya\u201d mural adorning the Melody Bar and Grill on Sepulveda Blvd. by LAX; a Lonzo Ball piece on Spectrum\u2019s El Segundo offices opposite the Lakers\u2019 training facilities; and a Brandon Ingram work donated to the Covenant House shelter for homeless youth in East Hollywood, which was part of Delta Airlines\u2019 \u201cBeyond the Court\u201d campaign. Perhaps his most visible piece is his sprawling \u201cTouch of Venice\u201d mural on Windward Avenue by the boardwalk.\n\nAs for Rock\u2019n Pies owner Conners, he is already reaping the benefits of Never\u2019s work, even before this Thursday\u2019s official opening.\n\n\u201cI was leaving the kitchen last night at 11:30, and I was greeted by flashing lights, people taking pictures,\u201d Conners tells Variety. \u201cWhen Jonas was working on it, everyone in their cars on the 101 were beeping their horns and cheering him on. It was pretty cool. Now there\u2019s something to look at while you\u2019re stuck in traffic.\u201d\n\nAnd while he\u2019s been a successful artist for a little more than a decade, Never still finds it hard to believe, which explains why he hasn\u2019t branched into T-shirts and design (with the exception of a Boo-Ya sneaker/NVR Shoes hook-up, donating a portion of proceeds to the Stuart Scott Foundation for cancer research). \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel real to me, which is why I haven\u2019t taken the time to capitalize on it. I\u2019m still too busy doing murals and canvasses.\u201d\n\nTo see a portfolio of Never\u2019s work, go to www.cult-classics.com. His Instagram tag is @never1959, named after the 1959 Edsel he bought after \u201cmaking some money from my art.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the San Fernando Valley, Warner Bros. Records in Burbank has turned its front facade into a Bennington memorial. Linkin Park is signed to the label and has released seven studio albums since 2000\u2019s \u201cHybrid Theory.\u201d", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chester-bennington-grammys-2017.jpg?w=999&h=587&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chester-bennington-memorial-wb-1-jpg-e1501632346200.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chester-bennington-grammys-2017.jpg?w=999&h=563&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chester-bennington-grammys-2017.jpg?w=999&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Roy Trakin", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/chester-bennington-mural-pizza-sherman-oaks-artist-jonas-never-1202513106/", "title": "Chester Bennington Memorial Mural Stops Traffic on L.A.\u2019s 101 Freeway", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "A mural dedicated to Linkin Park's Chester Bennington on the wall of Sherman Oaks pizzeria Rock 'N Pies is turning heads on the 101 freeway.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Roy Trakin", "tags": "Chester Bennington, Dave Grohl, Guns N Roses, Kurt Cobain, Linkin Park, Mike Shinoda", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Chester Bennington Memorial Mural Stops Traffic on L.A.\u2019s 101 Freeway", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/chester-bennington-mural-pizza-sherman-oaks-artist-jonas-never-1202513106/", "description": "A mural dedicated to Linkin Park's Chester Bennington on the wall of Sherman Oaks pizzeria Rock 'N Pies is turning heads on the 101 freeway.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chester-bennington-grammys-2017.jpg?w=999&h=563&crop=1", "width": 999, "height": 563, "alt": "Chester BenningtonWarner Music Group Grammy After Party, Inside, Los Angeles, USA - 12 Feb 2017"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-02T00:27:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-02T07:22:37+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "A mural dedicated to Linkin Park's Chester Bennington on the wall of Sherman Oaks pizzeria Rock 'N Pies is turning heads on the 101 freeway.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@roytrakin", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Chester Bennington Memorial Mural Stops Traffic on L.A.\u2019s 101 Freeway", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/chester-bennington-grammys-2017.jpg?w=999&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501633651.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
