So says a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, in which Flav accuses Public Enemy co-founder Chuck D and two business managers of cheating him out of royalties and merchandising revenue.\n\nFlav \u2014 real name, William Drayton \u2014 contends that his Public Enemy royalties have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years. In the last few months, he and his representatives have attempted to get a full accounting of the money owed to him, but have been thwarted.\n\nFlavor Flav and Chuck D were the two core members of the group. Chuck D was seen as the serious musical talent while Flav played the goofy hype man. The suit hints at years of pent-up hard feelings over this perception of their relative importance. Flav contends that there have been many attempts \u201cto minimize his role in the Public Enemy business\u201d over the years, while managers continued to exploit \u201chis fame and persona to market the brand.\u201d\n\nIn addition to naming Chuck D as a defendant, the suit also goes after Gary Rinaldo, the group\u2019s business manager since 2008, and Clifton \u201cGreg\u201d Johnson, who was until recently Flav\u2019s longtime personal manager.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nFlav alleges that he has not seen a dime in streaming or download revenue, and that the defendants have licensed Public Enemy\u2019s image without his permission.\n\nThe suit states that Rinaldo \u201centered into merchandising deals for products as disparate as Public Enemy branded watches, dolls of Drayton and bicycles, all without consent of Drayton, all without advance notice or compensation to Drayton.\u201d Flav also alleges that he was not consulted about a set of Public Enemy action figures, which were sculpted in Japan, and has received no payment from the sale of the toys.\n\nThis summer, Public Enemy made a new album, \u201cNothing is Quick in the Desert,\u201d available as a free download for a period of just six days. Though Flavor Flav was listed as an executive producer on the album, he says he was completely blindsided by it.\n\nThe suit says that Flav was contacted this spring about the project, and agreed to come to California to record.\n\n\u201cDrayton was in need of money to support his family, and Defendants were aware of that fact,\u201d the suit states.\n\nFlav requested a $75,000 fee. After a day of recording, he was given just $7,500 and told that more money would be wired to him later. He says he went to his hotel to wait for the remaining amount, and when it did not arrive he went back home to Las Vegas. According to the suit, he did not believe that his recordings would be used because they were of poor quality, and was surprised when the album was released on June 29.\n\n\u201cHe had never heard of the album, nor heard any of the final mixes,\u201d the suit states.\n\nFlavor Flav Suit by gmaddaus on Scribd", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/flavor-flav-chuck-d.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/flavor-flav-chuck-d.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gene Maddaus", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/flavor-flav-chuck-d-public-enemy-royalties-lawsuit-1202543573/", "title": "Flavor Flav Sues Chuck D Over Public Enemy Royalties", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The Public Enemy co-founder hints at years of feeling marginalized, and claims he has not been compensated for toys and merchandise", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Gene Maddaus", "tags": "Chuck D, Public Enemy", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Flavor Flav Sues Chuck D Over Public Enemy Royalties", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/flavor-flav-chuck-d-public-enemy-royalties-lawsuit-1202543573/", "description": "The Public Enemy co-founder hints at years of feeling marginalized, and claims he has not been compensated for toys and merchandise", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/flavor-flav-chuck-d.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Public Enemy - Chuck D and Flavor FlavWay Out West Festival in Gothenburg, Sweden - 10 Aug 2013"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-31T01:38:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-31T01:38:15+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Public Enemy co-founder hints at years of feeling marginalized, and claims he has not been compensated for toys and merchandise", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@GeneMaddaus", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Flavor Flav Sues Chuck D Over Public Enemy Royalties", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/flavor-flav-chuck-d.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504143495.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
