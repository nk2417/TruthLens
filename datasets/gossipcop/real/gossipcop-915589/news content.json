It was kind of extraordinary that she was that tall.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Allison opens up about the royally awkward encounter on The Late Late Show With James Corden. Post continues\u2026\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAllison, who took home the award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Tonya Harding\u2019s mother in I, Tonya at the event, then took it upon herself to give the beloved royal a bit of advice regarding her footwear. And to make matters worse, she called the expectant royal by a term of endearment \u2014 a huge royal no-no.\n\n\u201cI just told her that I was in bare feet and I felt \u2014 I told her she should take her shoes off \u2019cause she\u2019s pregnant. It was an awkward moment,\u201d the 58-year-old said. \u201cAs I did, I called her \u2018honey\u2019 and that might not have been royal etiquette.\u201d\n\nKate, though, as you\u2019d expect from the down-to-earth royal, was completely unfazed by the cringe-worthy encounter.\n\n\u201cShe was lovely,\u201d Allison said. \u201cThey loved I, Tonya and it was a pretty cool thing to meet them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKate, who will soon welcome her third child, was apparently unfazed by the royally awkward run-in.\n\nIn fact, the expectant parents were pictured smiling and laughing as they enjoyed their night on the town.\n\nOn Sunday, Kate and Will made a glittering entrance as they arrived at the Royal Albert Hall for the 71st British Academy Film Awards for the 2018 BAFTAs.\n\nKate, 36, turned to her favourite designer Jenny Packham to dress her for the event, highlighting her baby bump in a flowing emerald green gown. She complimented the moody-hued outfit with a smokey eye and soft tousled waves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, the look was topped off with royal jewels \u2014 and lots of them. This time around, the expectant royal went with an emerald and diamond earring, necklace and bracelet set.\n\nIt was the second time Prince William, who is the President of BAFTA, stepped out for the awards with his wife.\n\nLoading the player...\n\nRelated\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnwind and relax with your favourite magazine!
