The Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s sister wore a high neck, cap-sleeved ivory gown with a corseted bodice and bespoke lace detailing to marry financier James Matthews, 41, at St Mark\u2019s Church in Englefield, Berkshire. We think she looked ravishing, but what do fashion\u2019s finest think? We asked three bridalwear experts for their verdicts\u2026\n\nDavid Emanuel: The lace is a big hit\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s simple and pretty,\u201d says David Emanuel, host and creative director of Say Yes to the Dress UK, who also designed Princess Diana\u2019s wedding dress. \u201cI predicted it would be soft and pretty and very English, which it is.\u201d \u201cI love the lace, it looks so clean, so pristine, she looked immaculate,\u201d agrees couture designer Edwing D\u2019Angelo.\n\nPeta Hunt: It\u2019s a little bit sexy \u2013 but not too much\n\n\u201cI think the capped sleeves and delicate v-back show her arms, without being too over the top. It really emphasizes her waist,\u201d says Peta Hunt, editor-at-large, You & Your Wedding magazine. \u201cShe\u2019s got the key hole back detail which is how to show a bit of skin without being too much,\u201d agrees bridalwear designer Charlotte Balbier. \u201cI believe if you\u2019re going to show off the back detail then you must go high at the front, and she\u2019s done that. I love the high neck, that\u2019s my favourite part.\u201d\n\nDavid Emanuel: The dress totally suits the setting\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s an English country wedding, she went for soft and pretty,\u201d explains David Emanuel. \u201cIt\u2019s a very English girl\u2019s dress, for the classic English wedding,\u201d agrees Hunt. \u201dIt\u2019s a really appropriate dress for that venue and the fact she\u2019s having a country garden reception.\u201d Hunt thought that the pearl-embellished tulle veil, which was designed by legendary milliner Stephen Jones, flowed beautifully. \u201cIt\u2019s Britishness at its best, which is what we needed. She didn\u2019t want loads of sparkle, I\u2019m glad she stuck to her roots.\u201d\n\nEdwaing D\u2019Angelo: Giles Deacon was an excellent choice\n\n\u201cLooking at the dress, she was obviously looking for a romantic feel and I think [Giles Deacon] gave her that with this dress. I absolutely love his work, it was a great choice,\u201d Edwaing D\u2019Angelo says. David Emanuel thinks that the choice of a fashion-forward designer like Deacon over more mainstream or traditional names means Pippa is showing off her fashion credentials. \u201cIn his past, he\u2019s worked for big fashion houses and then he went into ready to wear and now he\u2019s doing couture\u2026he\u2019s relatively new on the scene.\u201d\n\nPeta Hunt: Pippa is going to be a trend-setter\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019re going to get lots of girls following her lead with this dress,\u201d Peta Hunt says. \u201cIt\u2019s an easy look for us all to emulate. It is what most girls dream of looking like, I feel.\u201d\n\nFor all the best photos and coverage of Pippa's big day, stay tuned to hellomagazine.com and pick up the souvenir edition of HELLO! magazine out on Monday.", "images": ["https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c268c5dec46b-ff-header.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/0e3cc35fa256-gettyimages-468217396.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/c39df3140e8c-pippa-middleton-experts-think-t.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/c39df3140e8c-pippa-middleton-experts-think-t.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c4387bfc4534-gettyimages-163699454.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/ca10e41b285e-gettyimages-469310863.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3a66ebb1c347-gettyimages-154745858.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/5a61735316b8-gettyimages-171171277.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/53014dc4aa56-dd5cc02d9cf5-360d0c46f482-hello-logo.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/4a94a7d76af8-pippa-middleton-wimbledon-cut-out-dress.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1b1d43d42337-gettyimages-127831831.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/c39df3140e8c-pippa-middleton-experts-think-t.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hello"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/fashion/royal-style/2018082161437/pippa-middleton-wedding-dress-experts/", "title": "Pippa Middleton's wedding dress: what the experts are saying", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "mrf": {"tags": "sub-section:royal-style", "sections": "fashion"}, "title": "What the experts are saying about Pippa Middleton's wedding dress | HELLO!", "description": "Pippa Middleton has married James Matthews and everyone\\'s talking about the dress", "robots": "max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "plantilla": "Plantilla de noticias (plantilla-noticias.html)", "og": {"url": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/fashion/royal-style/2018082161437/pippa-middleton-wedding-dress-experts/", "title": "Pippa Middleton's wedding dress: what the experts are saying", "description": "Pippa Middleton has married James Matthews and everyone\\'s talking about the dress", "article": {"author": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/author/hello/"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/c39df3140e8c-pippa-middleton-experts-think-t.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200", "height": 675, "width": 1200}, "type": "article", "site_name": "HELLO!", "updated_time": "2018-08-21T10:31:58.000Z"}, "lang": "en", "article": {"modified_time": "2018-08-21T10:31:58.000Z", "published_time": "2018-08-21T10:31:58.000Z", "section": "Royal Style", "tag": "Pippa Middleton,Article,Royal Style", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/hello/"}, "fb": {"app_id": 115281558857295, "pages": 89982930077, "admins": 89982930077}, "dc.title": "What the experts are saying about Pippa Middleton's wedding dress | HELLO!", "dc.date": "2018-08-21T10:31:58.000Z", "dc.author": "HELLO!", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@hellomag", "title": "Pippa Middleton's wedding dress: what the experts are saying", "image": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/c39df3140e8c-pippa-middleton-experts-think-t.jpg?tx=c_fill,w_1200", "description": "Pippa Middleton has married James Matthews and everyone\\'s talking about the dress", "creator": "@hellomag", "url": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/fashion/royal-style/2018082161437/pippa-middleton-wedding-dress-experts/"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#cc0000", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "version": "v4.54.1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1534847518.0, "source": "https://www.hellomagazine.com", "summary": ""}
