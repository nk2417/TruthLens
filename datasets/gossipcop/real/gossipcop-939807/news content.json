This is what he had to say:\n\n\u201cThis will be my last season playing the role of Rick Grimes. It means everything to me. I love the people who make this show. I\u2019m particularly fond of the people who watch this show. My relationship with Mr Rick Grimes is far from over.\u201d\n\nThe British actor explained that his decision stemmed from wanting to spend more time with his family back in the UK, having been forced to continually relocate to Georgia for filming since the show began.\n\nSpeaking to EW Radio, he said: \u201cI have two young children, and I live in a different country, and they become less portable as they get older. It was that simple. It was time for me to come home.\u201d\n\nOther sources, however, have suggested that Lincoln\u2019s decision to leave runs deeper \u2013 and may have been a consequence of former showrunner Scott Gimple unexpectedly writing his on-screen son Chandler Riggs out of the show during its eighth season.\n\nTom Payne, who plays Jesus, told Digital Spy: \u201cI think when Carl died last year and Chandler left, I think that was a moment for him of: \u2018OK, where does this leave Rick? And how does he move forward?\u2019 I think that was a pause for thought.\u201d\n\nRiggs refuted this, however, while speaking to Metro, revealing that Lincoln had been planning to quit for some time.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen I heard [the news], I honestly wasn\u2019t too surprised because we talked about him leaving for a while. He had brainstormed a lot of really cool ideas behind it.\n\n\u201cHe misses his family,\u201d Riggs continued. \u201cHe leaves every single year for like seven months to go do this show. After a while, you want to raise your kids and spend time with your wife. It was definitely really hard on him and I\u2019m super, super happy for him to be able to raise his family, and do more cool things that he\u2019d always talked about doing that he was never really able to do.\u201d\n\nRick\u2019s faced his fair share of trauma over the past nine seasons (AMC)\n\nPayne stated he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Lincoln was simply tired of being put through the emotional ringer. Across its nine seasons, the character has lost his closest friends and family in traumatic ways and has faced constant distress.\n\n\u201cIf you look at all of the work that Andy\u2019s done \u2013 [he] has been in floods of tears, with snot hanging out of his nose, and he\u2019s exhausted and covered in blood. Psychologically and physically, that\u2019s got to take its toll on you.\u201d\n\nThe ending of last week\u2019s episode saw Rick impaled on a spike and surrounded by walkers. Any concerns that this was Rick\u2019s demise, however, were dispelled when AMC released a new trailer showing Rick out of his terrifying predicament.\n\nAndrew Lincoln can stride away from The Walking Dead knowing he\u2019s left his imprint on television. As Rick Grimes, he\u2019s portrayed one of the small screen\u2019s most interesting heroes who, like Walter White and Don Draper, toed the line between hero and villainy with an intrigue most actors would struggle to convey.\n\nThe good news is that the character will return in three feature-length TV movies that have been announced by franchise overseer Scott Gimple - the first project heralding a series of new scripted projects that\u2019ll focus on other characters within the universe\n\nThe Walking Dead continues in the US on AMC every Sunday with the simulcast airing in the UK at 2am. The episode is also available to watch on NOW TV ahead of its repeat on FOX at 9pm the following evening", "images": ["https://www.independent.co.uk/img/logo-white-out.svg", "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/08/10/the-walking-dead-rick-negan.jpg", "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/01/15/the-walking-dead-andrew-lincoln-rick.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/01/15/the-walking-dead-andrew-lincoln-rick.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-walking-dead-season-9-episode-5-rick-grimes-leaving-andrew-lincoln-why-quit-a8612766.html", "title": "The Walking Dead season 9: The reason why Rick Grimes actor Andrew Lincoln quit the series", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/tv/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "The actor has played the lead character since its first episode 2010 \u2013 but what inspired his decision to leave?", "og": {"updated_time": "2018-11-06T09:13:23.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "The reason why Andrew Lincoln quit The Walking Dead", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-walking-dead-season-9-episode-5-rick-grimes-leaving-andrew-lincoln-why-quit-a8612766.html", "type": "article", "description": "The actor has played the lead character since its first episode 2010 \u2013 but what inspired his decision to leave?", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/01/15/the-walking-dead-andrew-lincoln-rick.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/01/15/the-walking-dead-andrew-lincoln-rick.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-11-06T09:13:23.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-11-06T09:13:23.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "TV & Radio", "author_name": "Jacob Stolworthy", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 1211, "image_count": 2, "embed_count": 3, "video_count": 2, "internal_link_count": 2, "external_link_count": 10}, "date": "2018-11-06T09:13:23.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176299319"}, "twitter": {"title": "The reason why Andrew Lincoln quit The Walking Dead", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The actor has played the lead character since its first episode 2010 \u2013 but what inspired his decision to leave?", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/01/15/the-walking-dead-andrew-lincoln-rick.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"The Walking Dead\",\"Andrew Lincoln\",\"Rick Grimes\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1541495603.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
