But this time around, he\u2019s got a lot more screen time: he\u2019s back in school, where bullies make fun of him; he keeps having terrifying \u201cepisodes\u201d that expose him to the shadowy realm that co-exists with his sleepy Indiana hometown; and, perhaps most importantly, he\u2019s got to decide how he feels about his prospective stepdad, played by none other than nerd royalty Sean Astin. Though this season holds many great surprises, one of its best is the skill and sensitivity with which Schnapp plays Will\u2014turning what could have been a flat scream-fest into something more deeply resonant. At times, staring into Will\u2019s wide, terrified eyes, it\u2019s hard not to feel his isolation and terror.\n\nIn an interview with V.F., Schnapp outlined tackling some of this season\u2019s greatest challenges\u2014including, yes, losing his voice for three days from screaming so much in the finale.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the massive success of Season 1 made the experience of filming Season 2 a little different. Security was beefed up: the cast\u2019s scripts had to be \u201call rounded up and given to this one guy, so he could burn it or something,\u201d according to Schnapp. And, yes, there were several meetings outlining what the cast could and could not discuss publicly\u2014though plenty of people have still tried to coax spoilers out of the actor. \u201cThey\u2019ll say it like, \u2018So I know this is happening. Can you just confirm it?\u2019 . . . People are very sneaky, but we\u2019ve been drilled in not to say anything.\u201d\n\nThe biggest challenge for Schnapp is one of relatability: \u201cI\u2019ve never been stuck in the Upside Down, and no one else I know has, so it was kind of something new to just create,\u201d Schnapp said. His inspirations? Schnapp read stories and myths about people who had been possessed, then did his best to put himself in Will\u2019s shoes. We won\u2019t spoil the finale, but Will does spend one particularly harrowing scene screaming his lungs out. Although the Duffers initially instructed Schnapp not to strain his voice\u2014the actual screaming sounds would be edited and added in later\u2014he went for it anyway; as the actor explained, \u201cit felt really weird [to have] my mouth open but not screaming.\u201d Eventually, he paid the price.", "images":
