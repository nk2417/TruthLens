And now it\u2019s soft.\u201d\n\nDuring his chat on the daytime program, Theroux \u2014 who married Aniston in a private August 2015 ceremony at their L.A. home \u2014 also shared what he and the Friends alum did for her birthday back in February. \u201cWe went to Cabo San Lucas and sat in the sun,\u201d the hunky star said. \u201cAnd we had a little party. We threw a little party and we had a pi\u00f1ata and I gave her some gifts and that was about it.
