The Olympian swam the the distance in the shark\u2019s natural habitat, off the coast of South Africa in 56-degree waters.\n\nPhelps clocked in at 38.1 seconds compared to 36.1 seconds for the great white shark. The Washington Post pointed out that both of those speeds are significantly faster than C\u00e9sar Cielo\u2019s 100-meter world record of 46.91 seconds set at the 2009 World Aquatics Championships, although Cielo obviously holds that record without the help of a wetsuit and monofin, which Phelps wore.\n\nRegardless of Phelps\u2019 abilities, Discovery\u2019s perceived false advertising eclipsed viewers\u2019 sentiments. After the race, comments like the following appeared to be the major takeaway:\n\nTurns out \u201cMichael Phelps races a shark\u201d was really just \u201cMichael Phelps swims alone and then compares his time to a shark\u2019s time.\u201d \u2014 Gary Parrish (@GaryParrishCBS) July 24, 2017\n\nMe pretending to be ok with Michael Phelps not racing a real shark pic.twitter.com/QnCF98NfBB \u2014 Gabi Palamone (@Yo_Gabi_Gabi__) July 24, 2017\n\nMichael Phelps not racing a real shark is like being sold Kanye tickets and then watching a Kanye hologram perform \u2014 Kenny Ducey (@KennyDucey) July 24, 2017\n\n\u201cAll the promotion, interviews and the program itself made clear that the challenge wasn\u2019t a side by side race,\u201d said a spokesperson from Discovery to Rolling Stone. \u201cDuring Michael\u2019s pre-show promotion, as well as within the first 2 minutes of \u2018Phelps vs. Shark,\u2019 this message was clear.\u201d\n\nMichael Phelps also defended the race while taking questions on Facebook Live. \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way \u2026 It\u2019s hard to swim in a cage when you\u2019re next to a shark \u2026 It wouldn\u2019t be able to move at the right speed. So how we did it was the best way that we could do it.\u201d\n\nTrending Stories Kevin Spacey Says He Has 'No Home' After Sexual Misconduct Allegations Brandi Carlile and Patty Loveless Pay Tribute to Vince Gill at 2025 CMA Awards 2025 CMA Awards: The Complete Winners List Neighbor Indicted in Murder of \u2018King of the Hill\u2019 Star Jonathan Joss\n\nWhile the race itself may not have lived up to the spectacle Discovery advertised, the episode gave interesting context for the speed of great white sharks (just check out this GIF of Phelps reacting to how easily a great white would win gold). Even though Phelps lost by a hair in this would-be race, to Phelps\u2019 credit, he could take down a reef shark in a 50-meter race by 0.2 seconds.\n\n\u201cRematch?\u201d Phelps tweeted after \u201closing\u201d to the ocean predator.
