He spent his first 20 seasons with the New England Patriots and was a central contributor to the franchise's dynasty from 2001 to 2019. In his final three seasons, he played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brady is widely regarded as the greatest quarterback of all time.[5]\n\nAfter playing college football for the Michigan Wolverines, Brady was selected 199th overall by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft, later earning him a reputation as the NFL's biggest draft steal.[6][7][8] He became the starting quarterback during his second season, which saw the Patriots win their first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXVI. As the team's primary starter for 18 seasons,[a] Brady led the Patriots to 17 division titles (including 11 consecutive from 2009 to 2019), 13 AFC Championship Games (including eight consecutive from 2011 to 2018), nine Super Bowl appearances, and six Super Bowl titles, all NFL records for a player and franchise.[b] He joined the Buccaneers in 2020 and won Super Bowl LV, extending his individual records to ten Super Bowl appearances and seven victories.[11] In 2024, Brady became the lead color commentator for the NFL on Fox[12][13] and a partial owner of the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nBrady holds many major quarterback records, including most career passing yards, completions, touchdown passes, and games started. He is the NFL leader in career quarterback wins, quarterback regular season wins, quarterback playoff wins, and Super Bowl Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, and the only Super Bowl MVP for two different franchises. Additional accolades held by Brady include the most Pro Bowl selections and the first unanimous NFL MVP. The only quarterback to win a Super Bowl in three separate decades, Brady is also noted for the longevity of his success. He was the oldest NFL MVP at age 40, the oldest Super Bowl MVP at age 43, and the oldest quarterback selected to the Pro Bowl at age 44.[14][15] Brady is the only NFL quarterback named to two all-decade teams (2000s and 2010s)[16] and was unanimously named to the 100th Anniversary All-Time Team in 2019.\n\nEarly life\n\nThomas Edward Patrick Brady Jr. was born on August 3, 1977, in San Mateo, California, the only son and fourth child of Galynn Patricia (n\u00e9e Johnson) and Thomas Brady Sr.[17] Brady was raised Catholic. His mother has Swedish, Norwegian, German, and Polish ancestry, while his father is of Irish descent; Brady has said his father is 100% Irish.[18][19][20]\n\nIn the 1980s, Brady regularly attended San Francisco 49ers games at Candlestick Park, where he was a fan of quarterback Joe Montana; Brady has called Montana his idol and one of his inspirations.[21] Aged four, Brady attended the 1981 NFC Championship, against the Dallas Cowboys, in which Montana threw \"The Catch\" to Dwight Clark.[22] Brady attended football camp at the College of San Mateo, where he was taught to throw by camp counselor and future NFL/AFL quarterback Tony Graziani.[23] Despite the rivalry between the teams, Brady grew up as a Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics fan.[24]\n\nBrady attended Jun\u00edpero Serra High School in San Mateo, where he graduated in 1995.[25] He played football, basketball, and baseball in high school. He played against Bellarmine College Preparatory rival Pat Burrell in football and baseball.[26] Brady began his career as the backup quarterback on the Padres junior varsity team. At first, Brady was not good enough to start on the 0\u20138 junior varsity team, which had not scored a touchdown all year.[27] Brady ascended to the starting position when the main quarterback was injured. He became the varsity starter in his junior year and held it until he graduated.[28] By Brady's senior year, he was striving to be noticed by college coaches. He created highlight tapes and sent them to schools he considered attending.[29] This led to interest from many football programs.\n\nThe process of recruiting then very different, athletes' rankings were not as prominent. In the 2000s, Brady would have been considered a three or four-star recruit,[30] and a highly rated prospect.[31] Brady was on Blue Chip Illustrated and a Prep Football Report All-American selection.[32] After his recruiting process, he narrowed his list to five schools.[33] \"Probably the ones that we did hear from and ultimately pared the list to were Cal\u2013Berkeley, UCLA, USC, Michigan and Illinois,\" his father said.[33] As a Cal-Berkeley fan, his father hoped Brady would attend the nearby school, where Brady was a silent commit, and that he would be able to watch his son play.[34][35]\n\nBrady was also known as a great baseball player in high school.[36] He was a left-handed-batting catcher with power. His skills impressed MLB scouts, and he was drafted in the 18th round of the 1995 MLB Draft by the Montreal Expos,[27][37] after the team brought Brady to Candlestick Park to work out with players, an unusual decision.[38] The Expos projected Brady as a potential All-Star, with then-GM Kevin Malone claiming Brady had the potential to be \"one of the greatest catchers ever\".[39] The team offered him money typical of that offered to a late second-round or early third-round pick,[40] but Brady was recruited by football assistant Bill Harris, to play for the University of Michigan in 1995.[33][41] Brady became the last active athlete drafted by the Expos.[42] He finished his high school career by completing 236 of 447 passes (53%) for 3,702 yards and 31 touchdowns.[43] Brady won All-State and All-Far West honors and the team's Most Valuable Player Award.[44]\n\nDuring the summers of 1998 and 1999, Brady was an intern at Merrill Lynch.[45] He was inducted into the Jun\u00edpero Serra High School Hall of Fame in 2003.[44] When Brady visited the school in 2012, after Super Bowl XLVI, administrators announced that they named the football stadium Brady Family Stadium.[46]\n\nCollege career\n\nBrady played college football at the University of Michigan for the Wolverines from 1995 to 1999.[47][48] After redshirting in 1995,[49] Brady spent the next two years as a backup quarterback, while future NFL quarterback Brian Griese led the 1997 Wolverines to an undefeated season, capped by victory in the 1998 Rose Bowl and a share of the national championship.[50] Initially, Brady was seventh on the depth chart, and struggled to get playing time.[51] Brady hired a sports psychologist to help him cope with frustration and anxiety, and considered transferring to the University of California, Berkeley.[52][53] He worked closely with assistant athletic director Greg Harden, who met with Brady every week to build his confidence and maximize his performance.[54] Brady told 60 Minutes in 2014: \"He will always be somebody I rely on for sound advice and mentorship. He has helped me with my own personal struggles in both athletics and in life. Greg really pushed me in a direction that I wasn't sure I could go.\"[55]\n\nOn September 28, 1996, Brady appeared in his first collegiate game after Michigan was up 35\u20133 against UCLA late in the fourth quarter. His first-ever pass attempt was intercepted by Phillip Ward and returned for a 42-yard touchdown.[56]\n\nUnder Michigan head coach Lloyd Carr, Brady battled for the starting job with Drew Henson[48] and ultimately started every game in the 1998 and 1999 seasons. Brady was All-Big Ten Conference honorable mention both seasons and team captain in his senior year.[57] During his first full year as the starter, he set Michigan records for most pass attempts and completions in a season, for a total of 214.[58] He set a school record for completions in a 31\u201316 loss against Ohio State in 1998, a season in which Michigan shared the Big Ten title.[59] Brady capped that season with a 45\u201331 win over Arkansas in the 1999 Citrus Bowl.\n\nBrady with the Michigan Wolverines in 1999\n\nIn the 1999 season, Brady had to hold off Henson again for the starting job. They platooned during the first seven games, with Brady playing the first quarter, Henson second, and Carr deciding upon a quarterback for the second half. The 1999 Wolverines started with a 5\u20130 record, including a 26\u201322 win over Notre Dame, and a road win against eventual powerhouse Wisconsin.[61] Against Michigan State, Brady was not chosen to play the second half; however, after being reinserted with Michigan down by 17 points, he nearly led Michigan all the way back before losing 34\u201331.[62] After a 300-yard passing game the following week, Carr went exclusively with Brady for the remainder of the season. On October 30 against Indiana, Brady played the entire game for the first time in the season and threw for 226 yards, his fifth straight game throwing for 200 yards, to lead Michigan in a 34\u201331 win.[63] Against Penn State, Brady led Michigan to another 4th-quarter comeback in a 31\u201327 win, heading into the regular season's final game as winners of three straight.[64]\n\nMichigan concluded the regular season against Ohio State; this was a dramatic game with a trip to the Orange Bowl on the line. With five minutes left, tied 17\u201317, Brady led Michigan to the winning score.[65] He led Michigan to an overtime win in the 2000 Orange Bowl over Alabama, throwing for 369 yards and four touchdowns, leading the team back from two 14-point deficits in regulation. He threw the game-winning score on a bootleg play. Michigan won when Alabama missed an extra point following its touchdown.[66]\n\nIn the two seasons Brady started at Michigan, he posted a 20\u20135 record, including wins at the 1999 Citrus Bowl and 2000 Orange Bowl. Brady finished his career ranking third in Michigan history with 710 attempts and 442 completions, fourth with 5,351 yards and 62 completion percentage, and fifth with 35 touchdown passes.[44][67] He graduated in December 1999 with a Bachelor of Arts in General Studies.[68]\n\nCollege statistics\n\nSeason Team Passing Rushing Cmp Att Pct Yds Y/A TD Int Rtg Att Yds Avg TD 1995 Michigan Redshirt 1996 Michigan 3 5 60.0 26 5.2 0 1 63.7 0 0 0.0 0 1997 Michigan 12 15 80.0 103 6.9 0 0 137.7 2 \u221214 \u22127.0 0 1998 Michigan 200 323 61.9 2,427 7.5 14 10 133.1 54 \u2212105 \u22121.9 2 1999 Michigan 180 295 61.0 2,217 7.5 16 6 138.0 34 \u221231 \u22120.9 1 Career 395 638 61.9 4,773 7.5 30 17 134.9 90 \u2212150 \u22121.7 3\n\nProfessional career\n\nOverview\n\nBrady with the Patriots in 2009\n\nBrady's success has been attributed to his work ethic, competitive spirit, pocket awareness, and intelligence with him generally being a pocket passer during his entire career.[69] Across 23 seasons, he started 333 regular season and 48 playoff games, the most for an NFL quarterback, spending 20 seasons with the Patriots and three with the Buccaneers. He was the primary starter for 21 seasons, missing 2008 due to injury, and never played a snap where his team was mathematically eliminated from playoff contention.[70] He won 251 regular season and 35 postseason games, the most in NFL history, and is the only quarterback to win 200 regular season games. He won 17 AFC East titles with New England and led Tampa Bay to a wild card berth in 2020 and NFC South titles in 2021 and 2022.[72] Brady is the only quarterback to lead a team to a 16\u20130 regular season (2007), became one of four quarterbacks to defeat all 32 teams in 2021, holds the most Pro Bowl selections (15), and was named league MVP three times (2007, 2010, 2017), with his 2010 award being the first unanimous MVP.[73]\n\nBrady's 21 seasons as the primary starter led to seven Super Bowl titles, the most of any player and more than any NFL franchise.[74] He appeared in a record 10 Super Bowls and is one of two quarterbacks, along with Peyton Manning, to win with multiple franchises, earning six titles with the Patriots and one with the Buccaneers. Brady holds the record for Super Bowl MVP awards with five[75] and is the only player to win it with multiple teams.[76] Holding nearly every major quarterback record, he is the all-time leader in passing yards, attempts, and touchdowns in both the regular season and playoffs, the only quarterback with 600 career regular-season touchdowns, and the record holder for completions.[77] In 333 career starts, he is the only quarterback with three separate streaks of over 100 consecutive starts, with his first ending due to injury in 2008 and his second due to suspension in 2016.[44] His longevity led to multiple age-related records.\n\nOn the Patriots, Brady and head coach Bill Belichick formed the NFL's most successful quarterback\u2013head coach tandem,[79] leading the team's dynasty from 2001 to 2019, commonly referred to as the Brady\u2013Belichick era.[80] The Patriots' dynasty is one of the greatest in sports history, with Brady's contributions helping the team set records for Super Bowl appearances (11) and wins (6, tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers).[81] In Brady's first season as the primary starter, the Patriots won their first championship in Super Bowl XXXVI, followed by consecutive titles in 2003 and 2004.[82] The Patriots won an NFL-record 21 consecutive games (regular season and playoffs) during this period, while Brady won his first 10 consecutive postseason games, another record.[83]\n\nWhen Brady signed with Tampa Bay in 2020, the team had not reached the postseason since 2007 or won a playoff game since 2002.[84] Brady helped end both droughts en route to the Buccaneers winning Super Bowl LV.[85] In 2021, he set the season record for completions and led the league in passing yards and touchdowns; his passing yards were a career-high.[86] In his final season, despite finishing with a losing record for the first time, Brady broke his single-season completion record and set the season record for attempts.[87]\n\nOne of the NFL's most decorated and accomplished players, Brady is widely cited as the greatest quarterback of all time.[5] He is considered one of NFL's greatest players of all time[88][89][90][91] and one of the greatest athletes in sports history.[92][93][94][95]\n\nNew England Patriots\n\n2000: Draft and rookie season on the bench\n\nBrady was a lightly regarded prospect coming out of college,[99] with an unimpressive NFL Scouting Combine performance reinforcing this reputation.[100] As a result, he was not selected until the sixth round of the 2000 NFL draft by the New England Patriots, 199th overall, a compensatory pick the Patriots earned due to the loss of punter Tom Tupa,[101] and he was the seventh quarterback taken. He and his family believed Brady would be drafted in the second or third round; they watched on television, stunned as six other quarterbacks were drafted before him. Brady was so embarrassed he briefly left the family home during the sixth round and cried when recalling the experience for an interview 11 years later. Brady later said that when the Patriots notified him he would be drafted, he was grateful he would not \"have to be an insurance salesman\".[102] According to Michael Holley's book Patriot Reign, the Patriots were considering Brady and Tim Rattay, both of whom had received positive reviews from then-quarterbacks coach Dick Rehbein.[103] Ultimately, the Patriots front office chose Brady. Considering his success, many analysts have called Brady the best NFL draft pick of all time.[104][105][106][107] Patriots owner Robert Kraft recalled: \"I still have the image of Tom Brady coming down the old Foxboro Stadium steps with that pizza box under his arm, a skinny beanpole, and when he introduced himself to me and said 'Hi Mr. Kraft,' he was about to say who he was, but I said 'I know who you are, you're Tom Brady. You're our sixth round draft choice,'\" recalled Kraft. \"And he looked me in the eye and said 'I'm the best decision this organization has ever made.' It looks like he could be right.\"[108]\n\nBrady started the 2000 season as the fourth-string quarterback, behind starter Drew Bledsoe and backups John Friesz and Michael Bishop; by the end of the season, he was number two on the depth chart behind Bledsoe.[109] During his rookie season, he was 1-for-3 passing, for six yards.[110] Tight end Rod Rutledge caught Brady's first and only completed pass of the season in a 34\u20139 loss to the Detroit Lions.[111][112]\n\n2001: Taking over as starter and first Super Bowl victory\n\nWith Bledsoe as starting quarterback, the Patriots opened the 2001 season with a 23\u201317 road loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.[113] In their second game and home opener on September 23, the Patriots squared off against their AFC East rivals, the New York Jets. Bledsoe was again the starter; in the fourth quarter, he suffered internal bleeding after a hit from Jets linebacker Mo Lewis. Bledsoe returned for the next series, but was replaced with Brady for the Patriots' final series of the game. New York held on to win 10\u20133, and the Patriots fell to 0\u20132 on the season.[114] Brady was named the starter for the season's third game, against the Indianapolis Colts, in which the Patriots posted a 44\u201313 win.[115][116]\n\nIn the Patriots' fifth game, Brady began to find his stride. Trailing the visiting San Diego Chargers 26\u201316 in the fourth quarter, he led the Patriots on two scoring drives to force overtime, and another in overtime to set up a winning field goal for a 29\u201326 victory. Brady finished with 33 of 54, for 364 yards and two touchdowns, and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the first time.[117][118] The following week, Brady again played well during the rematch at Indianapolis, with a passer rating of 148.3 in a 38\u201317 win.[119] Brady won his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week nomination after a four-touchdown day in a 34\u201317 win over the New Orleans Saints in Week 11.[120] The Patriots went on to win eleven of the fourteen games Brady started, and six straight to finish the regular season, winning the AFC East and entering the NFL playoffs with a first-round bye.[121] He finished the 2001 season with 2,843 passing yards and 18 touchdowns, earning an invitation to the Pro Bowl.[122][123]\n\nIn Brady's first playoff game, he threw for 312 yards against the Oakland Raiders and led the Patriots back from a ten-point fourth-quarter deficit to send the game to overtime, where they won on a field goal 16\u201313. A controversial play occurred in the fourth quarter. Trailing by three points, Brady lost control of the ball after being hit by Raiders cornerback and former Michigan teammate Charles Woodson. Oakland initially recovered the ball but, citing the \"tuck rule\" \u2013 which states that any forward throwing motion by a quarterback begins a pass even if the quarterback loses possession of the ball as he is attempting to tuck it back toward his body \u2013 referee Walt Coleman overturned the call on instant replay, ruling it an incomplete pass rather than a fumble.[124] Brady finished the game 32-of-52 for 312 passing yards and one interception.[125]\n\nIn the AFC Championship Game against the Steelers, Brady injured his knee, and he was relieved by Bledsoe. The Patriots won the game by a score of 24\u201317.[126] Subsequently, Las Vegas oddsmakers positioned them as 14-point underdogs against the NFC champion St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXVI.[127]\n\nBrady returned from his knee injury to start in the Super Bowl at the Louisiana Superdome in New Orleans. Despite being heavy underdogs, the Patriots played well, holding the Rams' high-powered offense in check through the first three quarters. The Rams rallied from a 17\u20133 deficit to tie the game with 1:30 left in regulation. The Patriots then got the ball back at their own 17-yard line with no timeouts remaining. Sportscaster and former Super Bowl-winning coach John Madden argued that the Patriots should run out the clock and try to win in overtime.[128] Instead, Brady drove the Patriots' offense down the field to the Rams' 31-yard line before spiking the ball with seven seconds left. Kicker Adam Vinatieri converted a 48-yard field goal as time expired to give the Patriots a 20\u201317 win and their first ever league championship.[129] When discussing the game-winning drive, Madden stated that \"what Tom Brady just did, gives me goosebumps\".[130] Brady was named Super Bowl MVP while throwing for 145 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions. Aged 24 years and 6 months, Brady became the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl, surpassing Joe Namath (III) and Joe Montana (XVI).[131][132] Bledsoe was traded to the Buffalo Bills in April,[133] which cemented Brady's status as the Patriots' starting quarterback in 2002.[134]\n\n2002 season\n\nIn the Patriots' season opener, Brady had 294 passing yards and three touchdowns in the 30\u201314 win over the Steelers, and earned his third AFC Offensive Player of the Week title.[135][136] In Week 9, Brady won his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week title for a three-touchdown game in a 38\u20137 win over Buffalo.[137] Brady and the Patriots finished the season at 9\u20137, tied with the Jets and Miami Dolphins for the best record in the division; however, the Patriots lost the division title to the Jets on tiebreakers. Additionally, the Patriots lost the tiebreaker to the Cleveland Browns for the final wild card spot, causing them to miss the playoffs.[138] Though Brady posted a career-low single-season passer rating of 85.7 and a career-high of 14 interceptions, he threw for a league-leading 28 touchdown passes.[139]\n\n2003 and 2004 seasons: Back-to-back Super Bowl wins\n\nAfter opening the 2003 season at 2\u20132, Brady led the Patriots to twelve consecutive victories to finish the regular season at 14\u20132 to win the AFC East.[140] In Week 14, a 12\u20130 victory over the Dolphins, he recorded a 36-yard punt.[141] He won AFC Offensive Player of the Week twice, in Weeks 9 and 17.[142][143] Brady finished with 3,620 passing yards and 23 touchdowns,[144] and was third in NFL MVP voting to co-winners Peyton Manning and Steve McNair.[145]\n\nAfter earning a first-round bye, the Patriots defeated the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round, 17\u201314. In the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Colts, 24\u201314. In Super Bowl XXXVIII, Brady led the Patriots to a 32\u201329 victory over the NFC champion Carolina Panthers and was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time. Brady threw for 354 yards with three touchdowns and set the record for most completions by a quarterback in a Super Bowl with 32. With 1:08 left in the fourth quarter and the score tied 29\u201329, Brady led a drive with five completions to put the Patriots in position for the game-winning 41-yard field goal by Vinatieri.[146]\n\nDuring the 2004 season, Brady helped the Patriots set an NFL record with 21 straight wins dating from the previous year, an accomplishment honored in the Pro Football Hall of Fame (for official records, the NFL considers it an 18-game regular season winning streak; it does not count playoff games).[147] New England finished with a 14\u20132 record, equaling their 2003 record and the best regular-season record ever for a defending champion at the time (though this would later be surpassed by the 2011 Green Bay Packers, who defended their 2010 championship season with a 15-1 record).[148] The Patriots also won the AFC East title for the third time in four years.[149] Brady threw for 3,692 yards and 28 touchdowns, with a 92.6 passer rating, and was voted to his second Pro Bowl.[150][151]\n\nIn the playoffs, Brady led the Patriots to wins over the Colts in the Divisional Round by a score of 20\u20133 and the Steelers in the AFC Championship by a score of 41\u201327.[152] Brady played his best game of the year in Pittsburgh despite requiring intravenous therapy the previous night when he ran a temperature of 103 \u00b0F.[153] Against the NFL's best defense,[152] he recorded a quarterback passer rating of 130.5, his highest of the season.[115] In Super Bowl XXXIX, the Patriots defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, 24\u201321, capturing their third championship in four years. They became the first franchise since the Dallas Cowboys to do so.[154] Up until the 2023 season, the 2004 New England Patriots were the last NFL team to win a second straight Super Bowl. Brady threw for 236 yards and two touchdowns in the win.[155]\n\n2005 and 2006 seasons\n\nDuring the 2005 season, injuries suffered by running backs forced the Patriots to rely more on Brady's passing.[156][157] Brady had to adjust to new center Russ Hochstein and running back Heath Evans. Brady won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his Week 5 350-yard, three-touchdown victory over the Falcons.[158] Brady finished the season with 4,110 yards and 26 touchdowns, the former of which led the league.[159][160] He and the Patriots finished with a 10\u20136 record, winning their third straight AFC East title.[161] He was named to his third Pro Bowl.[162]\n\nIn the playoffs, Brady recorded 201 passing yards and three passing touchdowns to lead the Patriots to a 28\u20133 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wild Card Round. In the Divisional Round the Patriots lost 27\u201313 to the Denver Broncos.[163][164] Brady threw for 341 yards in the game with one touchdown and two interceptions in his first playoff loss, after ten victories.[165] After the season's end, it was revealed Brady had been playing with a sports hernia since December.[166]\n\nIn 2006, Brady led the Patriots to a 12\u20134 record and the fourth seed in the AFC playoffs.[167] Brady finished the regular season with 3,529 yards and 24 touchdowns.[168] He was not among the players initially selected to the Pro Bowl,[169] though was offered an injury-replacement selection when Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers was forced to withdraw; Brady declined.[170]\n\nIn the postseason, the Patriots first hosted their division rivals, the Jets, in the Wild Card Round. The Patriots defeated the Jets 37\u201316, as Brady went 22\u201334 for 212 yards and two touchdowns.[171] The Patriots traveled to San Diego to take on the Chargers in the Divisional Round. This was Brady's first playoff game in his home state of California. The Patriots struggled against the Chargers, whom many had picked as favorites to win Super Bowl XLI. With eight minutes left in the fourth quarter and the Patriots down by eight, Brady and the Patriots started a drive that ultimately decided the game. Brady threw a fourth-down interception to safety Marlon McCree, but wide receiver Troy Brown forced a fumble on McCree that wide receiver Reche Caldwell recovered to convert the first down.[172] With a new set of downs, Brady threw a touchdown pass to Caldwell and Faulk scored the two-point conversion to tie the game. On what would be the Patriots' final drive, Brady threw a 49-yard pass play to Caldwell, setting-up a field goal that gave New England a 24\u201321 lead with 1:10 remaining. The Chargers drove down the field, but missed a game-tying field goal attempt, as the Patriots held on to win.[173]\n\nIn the AFC Championship, the Patriots traveled to Indianapolis to play the Colts. The Patriots led at halftime, 21\u20136; however, Peyton Manning led the Colts to a comeback. Brady threw a late-game interception and the Patriots lost, 38\u201334.[174] Brady finished the loss 21 of 34 for 232 yards, one touchdown, and one interception.[175]\n\n2007: Perfect regular season and first MVP\n\nBrady during his first MVP season in 2007\n\nPlaying with an overhauled receiver corps\u2014in the 2007 off-season, the Patriots acquired wide receivers Dont\u00e9 Stallworth, Wes Welker, Kelley Washington, and Randy Moss; tight end Kyle Brady; and running back Sammy Morris\u2014Brady enjoyed one of the best seasons by a quarterback.[176][177] Brady was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for September and October.[178][179] Brady led the Patriots to the first 16\u20130 regular-season record in NFL history, outscoring opponents by an average of 37\u201317.[180] He attained career, franchise, and NFL records and milestones in the process. He was named as the AFC Offensive Player of the Week five times.[181] In a Week 6 game against the Dallas Cowboys, he had a career-high five passing touchdowns in a 48\u201327 win. The win tied him with Hall of Fame quarterback Roger Staubach for the most wins by a starting quarterback, in his first 100 regular-season starts, with 76.[182] The next week, in part of a 49\u201328 win against the Dolphins, he had another record day, with a career-high six passing touchdowns, setting a franchise record. He had the first game with a perfect passer rating of his career.[183] As part of a come-from-behind 24\u201320 victory against the Colts, he threw for another three touchdowns, the ninth consecutive game in which he had done so, breaking Peyton Manning's record of eight.[184] During the last game of the season against the Giants in which the Patriots won 38\u201335, Brady threw his 50th touchdown of the season, breaking Manning's single-season record of 49 from 2004.[185]\n\nBrady finished the season with 4,806 passing yards, 50 touchdown passes, eight interceptions, and a career-high 117.2 passer rating.[186] It was unanimously voted the greatest passing season ever by ESPN in 2013. His 50:8 touchdown to interception ratio was a then-NFL record. He became the first quarterback to pass for 50 touchdowns. He led the Patriots to the first undefeated regular season since the 16-game schedule was implemented in 1978. He directed an offense that scored a then-NFL record 589 points and 75 total touchdowns. The team's 50 total touchdown passes is the fourth-most ever in a season. Brady was named the Most Valuable Player and Offensive Player of the Year. He was honored by the Associated Press as their Male Athlete of the Year, the first time an NFL player earned the honor since Montana won in 1990.[187] He was named as a First-Team All-Pro and to his fourth career Pro Bowl.[188][189]\n\nIn the Patriots' first playoff game, a Divisional Round game against the Jaguars, Brady began with an NFL postseason record 16 consecutive completed passes, and finished with 26 completions in 28 attempts, a completion rate of 92.9% as the Patriots won 31\u201320. That is the highest single-game completion percentage (with at least 20 attempts) in NFL postseason history.[190] With the win, the Patriots matched the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins as the only team to win 17 consecutive games in one season.\n\nStatistically, Brady did not fare as well in the AFC Championship Game against the Chargers, throwing for 209 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions. Nevertheless, the Patriots won their 18th game of the season, 21\u201312, to advance to the Super Bowl for the fourth time in seven seasons. Brady, with the 100th win of his career, also set an NFL record for the fewest games needed by a starting quarterback to do so: his 100\u201326 record is sixteen games better than Joe Montana's.[191] In Super Bowl XLII against the New York Giants, Brady was pressured heavily and sacked five times. The Patriots managed to take the lead with a Brady touchdown to Moss with less than three minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, but the Giants were able to drive and score a last-minute touchdown to upset the Patriots 17\u201314, taking away what would have been the first perfect season since the NFL expanded its regular season to 16 games.[192]\n\n2008: Injury\n\nIn the Patriots' season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs at Gillette Stadium (in which the Patriots won 17\u201310), Brady's left knee was seriously injured midway through the first quarter on a hit by Chiefs safety Bernard Pollard; Brady left the game and did not return. The team later confirmed that he would require surgery, and it would prematurely end his 2008 season.[193] Brady tore both his anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament.[194] The injury ended Brady's streak of 111 consecutive starts.[195] Dr. Neal ElAttrache performed the anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction at the Los Angeles Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic on October 6, using Brady's patellar tendon graft to replace the torn ligament, and also repaired his medial collateral ligament, through a separate incision in his left knee.[196] An infection in the wound resulted in further debridement surgery several times since the original procedure. Brady received IV antibiotics for this infection which, at the time, threatened to delay his rehab.[197][198] Despite Brady's absence, the Patriots managed to finish the 2008 season with an 11\u20135 record; however, due to tiebreakers, the Patriots not only failed to win the AFC East division title, but missed the playoffs altogether for the first time since the 2002 season.[199]\n\n2009: Return from injury\n\nBrady in action against the Washington Redskins on August 28, 2009\n\nIn the 2009 season opener against the Bills, Brady's first game in more than a year, he threw for 378 yards and two touchdowns. In the final three minutes of the game, the Patriots were down 24\u201313 before Brady and tight end Benjamin Watson connected on two straight touchdowns to lead the Patriots to a 25\u201324 win.[200] He won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Bills.[201]\n\nOn October 18, 2009, under blizzard conditions, Brady set an NFL record against the Titans for most touchdowns in a quarter, throwing five in the second quarter. Brady finished the game with six touchdowns, tying his career-high from the 2007 season, and 380 yards, completing 29-of-34 attempts, finishing with a nearly perfect passer rating of 152.8.[202][203] The Patriots' 59\u20130 victory over the Titans tied the record for the largest margin of victory since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger,[204] and set a record for largest halftime lead in NFL history, which was 45\u20130.[205] He won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against the Titans.[206] Brady was later named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for October.[207] For Week 16, Brady won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for a four-touchdown game in a 35\u20137 win over the Jaguars.[208]\n\nBrady finished the 2009 regular season with 4,398 yards passing and 28 touchdowns for a 96.2 rating,[209] despite a broken right ring finger and three fractured ribs, which were suffered over the course of the season.[210] He was selected as a reserve to the 2010 Pro Bowl and named the 2009 NFL Comeback Player of the Year.[211][212]\n\nBrady ended the 2009 season throwing for 154 passing yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions in a 33\u201314 Wild Card Round loss to the Baltimore Ravens.[213] This was his first career home playoff loss and the Patriots' first home playoff loss since 1978.[214]\n\n2010: Second MVP\n\nOn September 10, 2010, Brady signed a four-year, $72 million contract extension, making him the highest-paid player in the NFL. The extension included $48.5 million in guaranteed money.[215]\n\nBrady became the fastest quarterback to achieve 100 regular season wins by helping his team defeat the Dolphins 41\u201314 on October 4.[216] On November 25, in a Thanksgiving Day game against the Lions, he earned a perfect passer rating for the second time in his career as the Patriots won 45\u201324.[217][218] The next week, a 45\u20133 victory over the Jets, Brady set a record of 26 consecutive regular-season home wins, breaking Brett Favre's record.[219][220] He won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the two games against the Lions and Jets.[221][222] For December, Brady was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month.[223] Brady threw for 3,900 yards with 36 touchdowns and only four interceptions on the season.[224]\n\nBrady was selected as a starter to the 2011 Pro Bowl.[225] However, he pulled out of the game (and was replaced by his former backup Matt Cassel, who then played for the Chiefs) after undergoing surgery for a stress fracture in his right foot dating back to 2008.[226] Brady was also the only unanimous selection for the AP All-Pro Team and was named the 2010 AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year. By unanimous decision, he won the MVP award for the second time in his career.[227] On the inaugural NFL Top 100 Players list, Brady was ranked as the best player in the NFL by his peers.[228]\n\nAfter earning the #1 seed and a bye week, the Patriots lost to the Jets in the Divisional Round, 28\u201321. Brady finished the game 29-of-45 for 299 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception which ended his NFL record of consecutive pass attempts without an interception at 340.[229][230]\n\n2011: Loss in Super Bowl XLVI\n\nBrady in Denver in 2011\n\nIn Week 1 of the 2011 season, Brady threw for a career-high 517 yards, four touchdowns, and one interception in a 38\u201324 win over the Dolphins and earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[231] In the game, he threw a record-tying 99-yard touchdown pass to Wes Welker.[232][233][234] Brady won AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the following game against the Chargers. He had 423 yards and three touchdowns in the 35\u201321 victory.[235] Brady closed out the season being named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for November and December.[236][237] In addition, he was the Week 16 AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[238] Brady had a statistically successful season, and in the regular season finale against the Bills (a 49\u201321 win), he became the fourth quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards in a season, finishing with 5,235; although Brady surpassed Dan Marino's longstanding record of 5,084 passing yards, he finished the season second in passing yards behind Drew Brees' 5,476.[239][240] The Patriots finished the season 13\u20133 and clinched the AFC's #1 seed.[241] For his efforts in the 2011 season, Brady was named to the Pro Bowl and was named as the fourth-best player in the NFL on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012 by his peers.[242][243]\n\nThere's no quarterback I'd rather have than Tom Brady. He's the best. He does so much for us in so many ways on so many different levels. I'm very fortunate that he's our quarterback and what he's able to do for this team. It's good to win with him and all the rest of our players. If that's more than somebody else did, I don't really care about that.[244] \u2014Bill Belichick, following the 2011 AFC Championship Game\n\nBrady led the Patriots to a 45\u201310 win over the Broncos in the Divisional Round, where he tied an NFL playoff record shared by Daryle Lamonica and Steve Young, throwing for six touchdown passes.[245] The win gave Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick sole possession of the NFL record for postseason wins by a quarterback\u2013head coach duo with 15.[246] In the AFC Championship game against the Ravens, Brady failed to throw a touchdown pass for the first time in 36 games, though he did score a one-yard rushing touchdown late in the game. A missed field goal from Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff gave Brady and the Patriots a 23\u201320 victory, sending Brady to his fifth Super Bowl.[247]\n\nIn Super Bowl XLVI, Brady and the Patriots met the Giants in a rematch of Super Bowl XLII, which the Giants won 21\u201317. On the Patriots' first offensive series, Brady was penalized for intentional grounding in the end zone, giving up a safety which gave the Giants an early 2\u20130 lead. Brady would bounce back from this early blunder, leading a Super Bowl record-tying 96-yard touchdown drive to close the first half and at one point completing 16 consecutive passes to give him a 20-of-23 mark partway into the third quarter, another Super Bowl record.[248] However, as was also the case four years earlier, the Patriots could not hold a late lead and allowed Eli Manning to lead the Giants to a game-winning touchdown with less than a minute left, giving Brady his second career Super Bowl loss.[249]\n\n2012 and 2013 seasons\n\nBrady started all 16 regular season games of the 2012 season and led the Patriots to a 12\u20134 record. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week three times that year in Weeks 4, 8, and 14.[250][251][252] He became the first quarterback to lead his team to ten division titles.[253] With a 557-point total, the Patriots became the first team to score at least 500 points in a season four different times, with Brady leading all four squads, also a record. He finished the season with 4,827 passing yards, 34 touchdowns, only eight interceptions, and a passer rating of 98.7.[254] Brady was named to the Pro Bowl for the eighth time in his career.[255] On the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013, Brady was ranked fourth by his fellow players for the second consecutive year.[256]\n\nBrady led the Patriots to a 41\u201328 win over the Houston Texans in the Divisional Round.[257] With the victory, Brady surpassed Joe Montana for most career playoff wins, with 17.[258] The Patriots were then upset by the eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Ravens, 28\u201313, in the AFC Championship.[259] He suffered his first career loss at home when leading by halftime, in which he was previously 67\u20130.[260]\n\nOn February 25, 2013, Brady and the Patriots agreed on a three-year contract extension, which kept him with the team through 2017.[261] Sportswriter Peter King called it an \"amazing\" deal and also noted that it reflected Patriots owner Robert Kraft's desire to make sure that Brady retired as a Patriot.[262]\n\nBrady during the 2013 season\n\nBrady and the Patriots began the season with much upheaval on the offensive side of the ball. Tight end Rob Gronkowski was injured and Aaron Hernandez was arrested. Wes Welker departed to the Broncos, Danny Woodhead left in free agency for the Chargers, and Brandon Lloyd was released from the team. In order to replace the five players, the Patriots signed Danny Amendola in free agency from the Rams, drafted rookie wide receivers Aaron Dobson and Josh Boyce, and signed undrafted rookie free agent wide receiver Kenbrell Thompkins. In the first two games of the season, Brady completed 52% of his passes and had three touchdowns and one interception.[263][264]\n\nBrady was in pursuit of Drew Brees' record of at least one touchdown in 54 consecutive regular season games and saw the streak end at 52 games in a Week 5 13\u20136 loss against the Bengals.[265] Brady earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his Week 12 overtime victory over the Broncos.[266]\n\nBrady and the Patriots would go on to finish the season well, as Brady was named to the Pro Bowl for the ninth time in his career and was ranked third on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014 list in the off-season.[267][268] The Patriots finished the season 12\u20134 to earn the second seed in the AFC and a first-round bye.[269] In the Divisional Round matchup against the Colts, Brady made his 25th playoff appearance, breaking Brett Favre's career record for playoff appearances by a quarterback. The Patriots won 43\u201322 behind a four-touchdown performance from running back LeGarrette Blount.[270] The following week, the Patriots lost 26\u201316 to the Broncos in the AFC Championship.[271]\n\n2014: Fourth Super Bowl win\n\nBrady in September 2014 against the Minnesota Vikings\n\nBrady started the 2014 season with a 33\u201320 loss to the Dolphins.[272] It was Brady's first opening day loss since the 2003 season.[273] After going 2\u20131 in the next three games, Brady helped lead the Patriots to a seven-game winning streak. In that stretch, Brady had two games with four touchdown passes and one game with five.[274][275] He won AFC Offensive Player of the Month for October.[276] Brady clinched his NFL record 12th AFC East division title with a Week 14 win against the San Diego Chargers, later in the season.[277] Brady was named to his tenth career Pro Bowl and was ranked third by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015 list.[278][279]\n\nIn a 35\u201331 Divisional Round win over the Ravens,[280] Brady threw for three touchdowns and ran in a fourth, breaking Curtis Martin's club record for rushing touchdowns in the playoffs; Brady also broke Joe Montana's record for playoff touchdowns with 46.[281] After the Ravens scored on their first two possessions, the Patriots were quickly down 14\u20130, but would end up tying the game 14\u201314. Brady threw an interception at the end of the first half, which wound up leading to a Baltimore 21\u201314 halftime lead. Down 28\u201314, Brady engineered an 80-yard drive, culminating in a touchdown to Rob Gronkowski to cut the lead to 28\u201321. The Patriots tied the game once again at 28 off of a trick play where Brady passed laterally to Julian Edelman who then threw a 51-yard touchdown to Amendola. Ravens kicker Justin Tucker converted a 25-yard field goal to give Baltimore a 31\u201328 fourth quarter lead. Brady got the ball back, and threw a 23-yard touchdown to wide receiver Brandon LaFell to give the Patriots their first lead, 35\u201331, with 5:13 remaining. After a Duron Harmon interception and a Joe Flacco Hail Mary attempt failed, Brady clinched his record ninth AFC Championship Game appearance. It was his fourth straight overall. After a 45\u20137 blowout of the Colts,[282] Brady advanced to play in his sixth Super Bowl, breaking a tie with John Elway for most career Super Bowl appearances by a quarterback.\n\nIn Super Bowl XLIX, Brady completed 37-of-50 passes for 328 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions. He guided a then-record ten-point fourth quarter comeback as the Patriots defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28\u201324 to give Brady his fourth Super Bowl ring, tying him with Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw for most Super Bowl victories by a starting quarterback.[283] He was named Super Bowl MVP for the third time, tying Montana's record.[284] Brady's 37 completed passes in the game set a Super Bowl record at the time, which Brady himself would break in Super Bowl LI two years later.[285]\n\nDeflategate report\n\nOn May 6, 2015, the NFL published a 243-page report regarding the deflation of footballs used in the previous season's AFC Championship Game.[286] The report concluded that, more likely than not, Brady was at least generally aware of the intentional deflation. On May 11, Brady was suspended for four games by the NFL for his involvement based on \"substantial and credible evidence\" that Brady knew Patriots employees were deflating footballs and that he was uncooperative with the investigators.[287] That day, Troy Vincent\u2014NFL Executive Vice President of Football Operations\u2014penned a letter to Brady that stated in part: \"Your actions as set forth in the report clearly constitute conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in the game of professional football.\" Brady, through the NFL Players Association, appealed the suspension on May 14.[289]\n\nOn July 28, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell upheld Brady's four-game suspension.[290] Goodell cited Brady's destruction of his cell phone as a critical factor in his decision to uphold Brady's suspension.[291][292] The NFL also filed papers in federal court seeking to confirm Roger Goodell's decision.[293] Brady gave permission to the NFLPA to appeal the suspension in federal court,[294] and released a statement on his Facebook page that expressed disappointment in and criticism of Goodell's decision to uphold the suspension.[295][296]\n\nCommentary on the initial punishment was mixed. Bleacher Report writer Mike Freeman made a statement agreeing with Goodell's decision, saying the penalties were \"brutal, but it deserved to be\".[297] Various commentators also implied that the prior reputation of the Patriots organization as a team that bends rules appeared to factor into the harshness of the punishment.[297][298] Others described the punishment as \"firm but fair\".[299]\n\nOn September 3, Judge Richard M. Berman of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York vacated Brady's suspension; this ruling allowed Brady to play in the first four games of the 2015 NFL season. In his decision, Judge Berman cited the NFL's failure to provide proper notice to Brady of the charges against him and the potential for a suspension.[300] Post-appeal commentary also criticized Goodell for \"manipulating Brady's testimony\" at the appeal hearing in his decision.[301]\n\nIn February 2022, sportswriter Mike Florio revealed that the NFL falsified data and hid information that would have cleared Brady and the Patriots of wrongdoing. In his book Playmakers: How the NFL Really Works (And Doesn't), Florio revealed that NFL executives, specifically vice president Troy Vincent, jumped to conclusions about the air pressure inside the Patriots' footballs at halftime of the AFC Championship game. He also noted that 11 of the 12 Patriot footballs used in the game were actually not outside the predicted range of Ideal Gas Law, and the other was only slightly below.[302]\n\nFlorio also revealed that NFL general counsel Jeff Pash ordered that the records of all PSI data gathered from the 2015 season be deleted. Leaked transcripts revealed that NFL senior VP of football operations Dave Gardi used false numbers in his letter to the Patriots which ordered that the team was to be investigated. It was also shown that Vincent did not instruct anyone to record the timing of the measurements taken, the temperature in the room during testing, if the footballs tested were wet or dry, and that he did not know which of the two air pressure gauges was used to make the pregame measurements. Vincent also admitted that he and other NFL executives never heard of the Ideal Gas Law and were unaware that PSI in a football can change in certain environments.[303]\n\n2015 season\n\nBrady in Denver in November 2015\n\nIn the NFL Kickoff game, Brady led the Patriots to a 28\u201321 win over the Steelers. He threw for 288 yards and four touchdowns, three of them to Rob Gronkowski.[304] The Patriots' victory was the 161st victory of Brady's career, all with the Patriots, which surpassed the record held by former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre for most regular season wins by a starting quarterback with a single team.[305] In Week 2, Brady threw for 466 yards and three touchdowns in a 40\u201332 win against the Bills. Through the first five games of the season, Brady threw a total of 14 touchdowns with one interception and had a quarterback rating of 118.4.[306] Brady was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for September.[307] In Week 8, a 36\u20137 victory over the Dolphins, he had 356 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn his 25th career AFC Offensive Player of the Week title.[308][309]\n\nDespite Brady's success, the Patriots were hit by many injuries to key players on offense, including wide receiver Julian Edelman, and the Patriots eventually lost their first game against the Broncos 30\u201324 in overtime, who were without Peyton Manning, in Denver following a 10\u20130 start.[310] The Patriots then lost three of their remaining five games to finish 12\u20134 for a fourth straight season, earning the 2-seed in the AFC.[311][312] Brady finished the regular season with a league-leading 36 touchdown passes and seven interceptions.[313] He was named to his 11th Pro Bowl (seventh straight), and was ranked as the second best player on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016 behind only league MVP Cam Newton.[314][315]\n\nWith the return of Julian Edelman from a foot injury, the Patriots defeated the Chiefs in the Divisional Round by a score of 27\u201320 after advancing with a first round bye.[316][317] Brady completed 28 of 42 passes for 302 yards and two passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown as he led the team to their fifth consecutive appearance in the AFC Championship.[318] The Patriots advanced to the AFC Championship to face Peyton Manning and the Broncos at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. It would turn out to be the 17th and final meeting between the two storied quarterbacks, as Manning would announce his retirement after the season ended. The Broncos' top-ranked defense limited Brady, who completed 27-of-56 passes, for 310 yards, two interceptions and a passing touchdown, all day, and the Patriots eventually lost the game 20\u201318 after a potential game-tying two-point conversion attempt failed with less than half a minute remaining.[319]\n\nDeflategate suspension\n\nOn February 29, 2016, Brady signed a two-year contract extension covering the 2018 and 2019 seasons.[320] On March 3, the NFL appealed Judge Richard M. Berman's 2015 decision to vacate Brady's four-game suspension as punishment for his alleged role in the Deflategate scandal. At the hearing, the three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit questioned Players Association lawyer Jeffrey L. Kessler and NFL lawyer Paul Clement, with Circuit Judge Denny Chin stating that \"the evidence of ball tampering is compelling, if not overwhelming.\"[321]\n\nOn April 25, the decision to vacate Brady's four-game suspension was overturned by the U.S. Appeals Court.[322][323] Circuit Judge Barrington Daniels Parker Jr., joined by Circuit Judge Chin, wrote that they could not \"second-guess\" the arbitration but were merely determining it \"met the minimum legal standards established by the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947\".[324] Circuit Chief Judge Robert Katzmann dissented, writing that the NFL's fines for using stickum was \"highly analogous\" and that here \"the Commissioner was doling out his own brand of industrial justice.\"[325] On May 23, Brady appealed for his case to be reheard by the full U.S. 2nd Circuit Court.[326] The 2nd Circuit Court denied Brady's request for an en banc hearing on July 13.[327] On July 15, Brady announced that he would give up his Deflategate fight and accept his suspension for the first four regular season games of the 2016 season.[328]\n\n2016: Fifth Super Bowl win\n\nBrady during the 2016 season\n\nAfter serving his four-game suspension, Brady made his 2016 season debut on October 9 on the road against the Browns; he completed 28-of-40 passes for 406 yards and three touchdowns in a 33\u201313 victory to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[329][330] Brady's outstanding numbers during his first four games following the suspension earned him the AFC Offensive Player of the Month award for October.[331]\n\nIn Week 11, Brady recorded four touchdowns and no interceptions in a 30\u201317 road win against the 49ers.[332] Those four touchdown passes gave him a total of 444 career regular season touchdown passes with one team, breaking Brett Favre's record with the Green Bay Packers. The following week, Brady completed 30-of-50 passes for 286 yards and two touchdowns in a 22\u201317 road victory against the Jets.[333] The win was also the Patriots' 500th victory (including playoffs) in franchise history. During this victory, Brady also became the fifth quarterback to record 60,000 career regular season passing yards, joining Peyton Manning, Brett Favre, Drew Brees, and Dan Marino.[334] The following week, Brady and the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams by a score of 26\u201310,[335] giving Brady his record-201st career victory, including playoff games.[336]\n\nWith a 16\u20133 victory over the Broncos,[337] the Patriots clinched an eighth consecutive AFC East title and a seventh consecutive first-round bye in the playoffs, both NFL records.[338] On December 20, 2016, Brady was named to the Pro Bowl for the eighth straight season and 12th time overall.[339][340] Brady ended the regular season with 28 passing touchdowns and only two interceptions for the regular season, breaking the previous TD:INT ratio record of Nick Foles's 27:2 figure set in 2013 with the Eagles.[341] Brady was named to the AP All-Pro Second Team.[342] Brady was also ranked first on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017 as the best player in the league, becoming the first player to be named as #1 twice since the listing began.[343]\n\nBrady and the Patriots began their postseason run in the Divisional Round, hosting the Texans, which held the league's No. 1 total defense. Brady completed 18-of-38 passes for 287 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions as the Patriots won 34\u201316, clinching a record sixth consecutive trip to the AFC Championship Game.[344] In the AFC Championship, the Patriots hosted the Steelers. Brady completed 32-of-42 passes for 384 yards, three touchdowns, and no interceptions in the 36\u201317 victory. The win gave Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick their record seventh conference title as a quarterback\u2013head coach tandem, and the Patriots an NFL record ninth Super Bowl appearance.[345]\n\nBrady and the Patriots faced the NFC champion Atlanta Falcons, who boasted the league's highest-scoring offense, in Super Bowl LI. Brady threw for 43 completions on 62 attempts for 466 passing yards\u2014all Super Bowl records at the time. Brady also threw for two touchdowns and an interception, which was returned for a touchdown by Robert Alford in the second quarter. After trailing 28\u20133 midway through the third quarter, Brady and the Patriots scored 25 unanswered points to tie the game at the end of regulation. This resulted in the first overtime in Super Bowl history. After winning the overtime coin toss, Brady led the Patriots down the field to score a touchdown and win the game by a score of 34\u201328,[346] completing the largest comeback win in both team history and Super Bowl history. With the victory, Brady won his fifth Super Bowl, which set a record for most Super Bowl victories of any quarterback in history and tied defensive player Charles Haley for the most Super Bowl victories for any player. In addition, Brady set another record by winning his fourth Super Bowl MVP award for his clutch performance. On a personal note, this game was also special for Brady because it was the first game this season that his mother had attended in person, after having been previously diagnosed with cancer.[348]\n\n2017: Third MVP and loss in Super Bowl LII\n\nBrady with the Patriots in 2017\n\nOn May 12, 2017, Brady was announced as the cover athlete for Madden NFL 18.[349] In a CBS interview on May 17, Charlie Rose asked Brady's wife, Gisele B\u00fcndchen, if she wanted Brady to retire, despite the fact that he was still playing at a high level. B\u00fcndchen mentioned that Brady suffered from a concussion in 2016, saying, \"I mean he has concussions pretty much every\u2014I mean we don't talk about\u2014but he does have concussions. I don't really think it's a healthy thing for anybody to go through.\"[350][351] Following the B\u00fcndchen interview, the NFL released a statement: \"We have reviewed all reports relating to Tom Brady from the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultants and certified athletic trainer spotters who worked at Patriots' home and away 2016 season games as well as club injury reports that were sent to the league office. There are no records that indicate that Mr. Brady suffered a head injury or concussion, or exhibited or complained of concussion symptoms. Today we have been in contact with the NFLPA and will work together to gather more information from the club's medical staff and Mr. Brady\".[352][353] Brady's agent, Don Yee, said that Brady was not diagnosed with a concussion during the 2016 season.[354]\n\nThe Patriots opened up their 2017 season with a 42\u201327 loss in the NFL Kickoff game to the Chiefs.[355] In Week 2, Brady's three touchdown passes and 447 passing yards in a 36\u201320 win over the New Orleans Saints earned him his 28th AFC Offensive Player of the Week award,[356] breaking the record previously held by Peyton Manning for the most AFC Offensive Player of the Week awards in a career.[357][358] He won the AFC Offensive Player of the Week again in the following week for his 378-yard, five-touchdown game in a 36\u201333 win over the Texans.[359] In Week 6, the Patriots defeated the Jets, 24\u201317.[360] Brady obtained his 187th career win, setting the record for most regular season wins in NFL history.[361] In Week 10, Brady won his third AFC Offensive Player of the Month for his three-touchdown game in a 41\u201316 win over the Broncos.[362] For the month of November, Brady won AFC Offensive Player of the Month.[363] On December 19, Brady was selected to the Pro Bowl for the 13th time in his career.[364] At age 40, Brady became the oldest quarterback ever to start all of his team's games in an NFL regular season.[c] Brady finished the regular season with a league-leading 4,577 passing yards, making him the oldest player ever to lead the league in passing yards.[365] He was named a first-team All-Pro by the Associated Press for the third time in his career.[366] Earning 40 of 50 votes, Brady was named the NFL Most Valuable Player for the third time in his career.[14] For the second straight year and third time overall, Brady was ranked No. 1 by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.[367]\n\nBrady and the Patriots began their postseason run by defeating the Titans, 35\u201314, in the Divisional Round of the playoffs.[368] With the win, the Patriots advanced to the AFC Championship Game for the seventh straight year. Days after the divisional round, it was revealed that Brady had a minor cut on his right hand, which required stitches.[369] Despite this injury, Brady managed to start the AFC Championship Game, where the Patriots hosted the Jaguars. Brady led a fourth quarter comeback to lead the Patriots to a 24\u201320 victory.[370] The win gave Brady and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick their eighth conference title as a quarterback\u2013head coach tandem, and the Patriots a berth in Super Bowl LII, their tenth Super Bowl appearance as a team, both of which extended NFL records.\n\nIn Super Bowl LII, the Patriots faced the Eagles and their second-string quarterback Nick Foles. Brady completed 28-of-48 attempts for three passing touchdowns, no interceptions, and a Super Bowl record 505 yards\u2013which set a new postseason game record for the most passing yards in NFL history.[371][372] With roughly two minutes remaining in the game and the Eagles leading 38\u201333, Brady was strip-sacked by Brandon Graham. The Eagles recovered the fumble and cemented their 41\u201333 win with a field goal, securing their first franchise Super Bowl victory in a game with the most combined total yardage in NFL history.[373] This was the third time overall that Brady had lost in a Super Bowl, becoming the fourth starting quarterback in Super Bowl history to lose at least three Super Bowls joining Jim Kelly, Fran Tarkenton, and John Elway.[374][375]\n\n2018\u20132019: Sixth Super Bowl win and final season in New England\n\nBrady started his 19th NFL season with 277 passing yards, three touchdowns, and one interception in a 27\u201320 victory over the Texans in the season opener.[376][377] In Week 5, in a 38\u201324 win against the Colts, Brady's 500th career touchdown pass went to Josh Gordon, who became the 71st different player to catch a touchdown from Brady, breaking a record previously held by Vinny Testaverde.[378][379] In Week 6, in a 43\u201340 win against the Chiefs, Brady secured his 200th career regular season win, making him the only quarterback in NFL history to accomplish that feat. In Week 15, Brady reached 70,000 passing yards, becoming the fourth quarterback in NFL history to accomplish the feat. During Week 16 against the Bills, Brady was limited to 126 passing yards, but the Patriots won 24\u201312, clinching the AFC East pennant for the 10th consecutive season and 16th time in 18 years.[380] In Week 17, Brady helped the Patriots clinch a first-round bye, with a 38\u20133 win against the Jets.[381][382] Brady finished the season completing 375-of-570 passes, 4,355 yards, 29 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions.[383] He earned his 14th career Pro Bowl nomination.[384] He was ranked sixth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[385]\n\nFollowing their first-round bye, the Patriots started their playoff run at home against the Los Angeles Chargers in the Divisional Round. The Patriots jumped out to a 35\u20137 halftime lead en route to a 41\u201328 win. With the win, the Patriots advanced to the AFC Championship Game for an eighth consecutive year, this time to face the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium.[386] The Patriots went into halftime with a 14\u20130 lead. However, the Chiefs led by young quarterback Patrick Mahomes battled back in the second half and sent the game into overtime with a score of 31\u201331. The Patriots won the coin toss to start overtime and elected to receive the ball. Brady led the Patriots on a 75-yard drive that resulted in a game-winning two-yard rushing touchdown by Rex Burkhead, to win the game 37\u201331. With the victory, Brady earned a third consecutive and ninth overall Super Bowl appearance for his career.[387]\n\nIn Super Bowl LIII, Brady completed 21-of-35 passes for 262 passing yards and an interception as the Patriots won 13\u20133 over the Rams in the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history. This was the first time in his nine Super Bowl appearances in which Brady did not have a passing touchdown, though with the game tied 3\u20133 and less than eight minutes left he successfully connected with Rob Gronkowski down the sideline between three defenders to set up the go-ahead touchdown.[388] With the victory, the Patriots became the second NFL team to win six Super Bowls, tying the Steelers for the most in NFL history.[389] In addition, Brady became the oldest quarterback at 41 years of age to win a Super Bowl,[348] as well as the first player ever to win six Super Bowls, breaking a tie with Charles Haley.[390][391]\n\nBrady in a game against the Redskins in 2019\n\nOn August 4, 2019, Brady signed a two-year contract extension worth $70 million through the 2021 season;[392] the terms of the contract allowed Brady to become a free agent after the 2019 season.[393] Against the 2019 Patriots salary cap, Brady was the highest-paid player on the team at $21.5 million.[394] Belichick was unwilling to offer a longer-term deal that Brady sought.[395]\n\nBrady began the season by completing 24 of 36 passes for 341 yards and three touchdowns in a 33\u20133 win over the Steelers.[396] During a 33\u20137 victory against the Washington Redskins in Week 5, Brady surpassed Brett Favre for third place on the all-time passing yards list.[397] The following week in a 35\u201314 win against the Giants, Brady overtook Peyton Manning for second place on the all-time passing yards list, behind only Drew Brees.[398] Although the Patriots' defense was performing well, the offense was notedly stagnant, and Brady told friends that he \"felt Belichick had taken the offense for granted because of how good it had been for so long\"; he said to NBC that he was the \"most miserable 8\u20130 quarterback in the NFL.\"[388] Brady and the Patriots struggled during the second half of the season, losing three of their next five games following the 8\u20130 start, including back-to-back losses in Weeks 13 and 14 against the Texans (28\u201322) and Chiefs (23\u201316).[399][400] In Week 17, Brady's final regular-season game as a Patriot, he threw for 221 yards and two touchdowns, but also threw an interception that was returned by former Patriots teammate Eric Rowe for a touchdown in a 27\u201324 loss to the Miami Dolphins. Although the Patriots finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record and won the AFC East for the 11th consecutive year, this loss, combined with a win by the Chiefs, denied New England a first-round bye for the first time since 2009. Personally, however, Brady passed Peyton Manning for the second-most touchdown passes in NFL history, with 541.[401]\n\nBrady in the 2019 playoffs against the Tennessee Titans, his final game with the Patriots\n\nThe Patriots began their postseason run in the Wild Card Round, where they faced the Titans. With his team trailing 14\u201313 and pinned back on its 1-yard line with 15 seconds left in the game, Brady's final pass attempt of the game \u2013 and his last as a Patriot \u2013 was intercepted and returned for a touchdown by Titans cornerback and former teammate Logan Ryan, which effectively sealed the 20\u201313 win for Tennessee.[402][403] During the NFL's celebration of their 100th season, Brady was named to the NFL 100 All-Time Team.[404] He was ranked 14th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[405]\n\nOn March 17, 2020, the day before his contract with the Patriots expired, Brady announced that he would not re-sign with the team for the 2020 season, ending his 20-year tenure in New England.[406] After Brady signed with Tampa Bay, billboards thanking Brady for his services were posted alongside the Massachusetts Turnpike and eleven other locations around New England.[407]\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers\n\n2020 season: Seventh Super Bowl win\n\nBrady against the Washington Football Team in the 2020 playoffs\n\nBrady signed with the Buccaneers on March 20, 2020. The two-year contract was worth $50 million in fully guaranteed money, with up to $4.5 million each year in incentives. The deal included a no-trade and a no-franchise tag clause.[408] Although his career number of 12 was assigned to Chris Godwin, Godwin offered it to Brady as a sign of respect and switched his number to 14.[409] In April 2020, Brady was reunited with former Patriots teammate Rob Gronkowski when the tight end came out of retirement and was traded to the Buccaneers.[410] Head coach Bruce Arians stated that it was Brady who was adamant for the team to trade for Gronkowski.[411]\n\nMaking his Buccaneers debut in New Orleans against the Saints on September 13, Brady completed 23-of-36 passes for 239 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions, and additionally scored a rushing touchdown as the Saints defeated the Buccaneers 34\u201323.[412] Brady bounced back with three solid performances as the Buccaneers won their next three games, including a Week 4 performance against the Chargers in which he completed 30 of 46 passes for 369 yards, five touchdowns, and an interception.[413] Brady's five touchdowns in the Buccaneers' 38\u201331 win against the Chargers marked the seventh time in his career he had five touchdowns in a game and, at age 43, made him the oldest quarterback to have a five-touchdown game.[414] Brady's Week 4 performance earned him the NFC Offensive Player of the Week award for the first time in his career.[415] For the month of October, Brady won NFC Offensive Player of the Month.[416] In Week 9 against New Orleans, Brady threw for 209 yards and three interceptions during the 38\u20133 loss. This was the most lopsided loss of Brady's career, as well as the first time in his 20-year career that he had been swept by a divisional opponent.[417]\n\nBrady later said that playing behind closed doors from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the NFL made it easier for him to execute his new team's unfamiliar football playbook.[418] In Week 16 against the Lions, Brady completed 22-of-27 attempts with 348 yards, four touchdowns, and a perfect passer rating of 158.3 in the first half before being rested in the second half of the 47\u20137 victory. The win ended a 13-year playoff drought for the Buccaneers.[84] Overall, he finished the 2020 season with 4,633 passing yards, 40 passing touchdowns, and 12 interceptions.[419][85] Due to the Saints winning the division, the Buccaneers settled for a wild card spot, marking a career-first for Brady.[72]\n\nIn the Wild Card Round against the Washington Football Team, Brady threw for 381 yards and two touchdowns in the 31\u201323 win. During the game, he became the oldest player to throw a touchdown pass in NFL postseason history.[420] In the Divisional Round against the Saints, Brady threw for 199 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for a touchdown in the 30\u201320 win. As Brady and Saints quarterback Drew Brees were both over 40 years old and were first and second in career touchdown passes and career passing yards, the game was hyped as the potential final matchup between the two stars[421][422] (which it indeed turned out to be, as Brees retired following the season). Brady extended his record of Conference Championship game appearances to 14.[423][424][425] In the NFC Championship, Brady threw for 280 yards, three touchdowns and three interceptions in a 31\u201326 win over Aaron Rodgers and the Packers at Lambeau Field. It was another highly anticipated matchup since Brady and Rodgers were two of the most statistically efficient quarterbacks, and this was their first postseason matchup.[426] The win gave Brady his record-extending tenth Super Bowl appearance, making Brady the fourth quarterback to lead two different teams to the Super Bowl, joining Craig Morton, Kurt Warner, and Peyton Manning, and the second after Morton to reach the Super Bowl from both conferences.[427] The Buccaneers became the first team to play in a Super Bowl in its home stadium.[428]\n\nSuper Bowl LV was the first title game where both starting quarterbacks, Brady and his opposing counterpart Patrick Mahomes, have won the AP NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP awards; as Brady is Mahomes' senior by 18 years, some billed the matchup as comparable to Michael Jordan versus LeBron James.[429] Brady threw for 201 yards and three touchdowns in Tampa Bay's 31\u20139 win over the Chiefs. He had led the Buccaneers to become only the seventh Wild Card team to win the Super Bowl and only the fifth to do so by winning three road games.[430] Brady was awarded Super Bowl MVP for the game. His two touchdown passes to tight end Rob Gronkowski set a record for most postseason touchdown passes for a passer-receiver duo, with 14, breaking the mark previously held by Joe Montana and Jerry Rice.[431] Brady extended his record for most Super Bowl wins by a player with his seventh and extended his record for Super Bowl MVP awards, with five.[432] Brady became the second quarterback, joining Peyton Manning, to lead two different teams to Super Bowl wins, but the first to win Super Bowl MVP with two different teams. He was the first quarterback to win the Super Bowl with teams from different conferences.[433] Brady became the player with the most championships in NFL history and tied Otto Graham for the most league championships in professional football history by a player at seven. With the win, Brady became the oldest quarterback in Super Bowl history to start, play, win, and receive the MVP award.[76] He was ranked seventh by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.[434]\n\n2021 season\n\nBrady during the 2021 season\n\nOn February 11, 2021, it was revealed that Brady had knee discomfort through most of the 2020 season and would require a minor arthroscopy for a routine cleanup.[435] Brady signed a one-year contract extension through the 2022 season with the Buccaneers on March 12, 2021.[436][437] On July 15, it was revealed that Brady had a torn MCL in the knee that had to undergo surgery, an injury that had plagued him for the entire 2020 season.[438] The NFL declined to comment on the Buccaneers' failure to disclose this injury.[439]\n\nIn the NFL Kickoff game against the Cowboys, Brady threw for 379 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions leading the Buccaneers to a 31\u201329 win. Brady and tight end Rob Gronkowski became the second passer-receiver duo to record 100 touchdown passes, joining Peyton Manning and Marvin Harrison.[440] In Week 3, against the Rams, Brady threw for 432 yards, and had two touchdowns, and joined Drew Brees as the only players in NFL history to record 80,000 passing yards during the 34\u201324 loss.[441] In his return to New England in Week 4 against Belichick and rookie quarterback Mac Jones, Brady surpassed Brees, who coincidentally was on the sidelines as an analyst for NBC Sunday Night Football, for the most passing yards in National Football League history. He broke the record on a 28-yard completion to Mike Evans in the first quarter.[442] With the victory over his former team, Brady became the fourth quarterback in NFL history to record a win against all 32 current teams in the league, joining Brett Favre, Peyton Manning, and Drew Brees. In addition, he became the sixth quarterback to have a victory against every incumbent NFL franchise after Fran Tarkenton and Joe Montana, as the league only had 28 teams during the latter two's respective tenures.[443]\n\nIn Week 5, Brady threw for 411 yards and five touchdowns in a 45\u201317 win over the Dolphins, earning NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[444] In Week 7, Brady became the first quarterback in NFL history to record 600 touchdown passes, with a nine-yard pass to Evans in a win against the Chicago Bears.[445] In Week 14, Brady surpassed Brees for most all-time pass completions list in NFL history and became the first quarterback to record 700 touchdown passes in regular season and postseason combined with a game-winning 58-yard pass to Breshad Perriman against the Bills.[446] Brady finished the 2021 season with an NFL record 485 pass completions for a career-high 5,316 passing yards, 43 passing touchdowns, and 12 interceptions.[447][448] Brady became the oldest player in NFL history to pass for at least 5,000 yards and his passing yards total marked the third-most for a single season in NFL history.[86] He was named to the Pro Bowl for the 15th time.[449]\n\nIn the Wild Card Round, the Buccaneers faced off against the Eagles, as a rematch of their Week 6 regular season game. Brady completed 29 of 37 passes for 271 yards and 2 touchdowns as they won 31\u201315.[450] Brady and the Buccaneers advanced to the Divisional Round to face off against the Rams, to whom they previously lost in the regular season. Brady and the Buccaneers fell behind 27\u20133 in the third quarter, until Brady was able to lead the team to 24 unanswered points and a tie game; however, the Rams scored a field goal in the closing seconds to defeat the Buccaneers 30\u201327. Brady finished the game with 329 yards, a touchdown, and an interception.[451] The Rams later went on to win Super Bowl LVI.[452]\n\nBrady announced his retirement on February 1, 2022, after 22 seasons.[453] In Brady's first two years with Tampa, the Buccaneers posted a regular season record of 24\u20139, which were the two most successful back-to-back seasons in franchise history. Their 13\u20134 regular season record in 2021 was the best result in franchise history, eclipsing the 12\u20134 record of the 2002 Super Bowl winning team.[454] Prior to Brady's arrival, the franchise had an all-time playoff record of 6\u20139; at the time of Brady's retirement, the all-time playoff record for Tampa Bay stood at 11\u201310.[455] He was ranked first by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022, his fourth time being ranked first.[456]\n\n2022 season\n\nOn March 13, 2022, just 40 days after initially announcing his retirement, Brady announced he would return to the Buccaneers for the 2022 season.[457] In the Buccaneers' season-opening game against the Cowboys, Brady became the oldest quarterback to start a game in NFL history.[458] In Week 3 against the Packers, Brady became the first quarterback in NFL history to reach 85,000 career passing yards. Brady and the Buccaneers lost in Weeks 6, 7, and 8, dropping the team to 3\u20135. It was the first three-game losing streak for Brady since his 2002 season with the Patriots.[460] In Week 8 against the Ravens, Brady was sacked by Justin Houston just before halftime. In turn, Brady became the most sacked quarterback in NFL history with 555 sacks taken, passing Ben Roethlisberger.[461]\n\nIn Week 9 against the Rams, Brady became the first quarterback in NFL history to reach 100,000 passing yards in his career (combined regular season and postseason).[462] With nine seconds left in regulation, Brady completed a touchdown pass to rookie tight end Cade Otton to win 16\u201313. The game-winning drive was the 55th of Brady's career, passing Peyton Manning for the most all-time.[463] The following week, Brady led the Buccaneers to a 21\u201316 victory over the Seahawks in a game played in Germany, making Brady the first quarterback to win NFL games in three different countries outside the U.S. (having won games played in England and Mexico while he was with New England).[464]\n\nOn November 27, Brady saw a streak end. He was 218\u20130 when his team was leading by at least seven points in the final two minutes of regulation. Facing the Browns, the Buccaneers led by seven until the final thirty seconds when the Browns tied the game on a touchdown in an eventual overtime win by Cleveland.[465] In a Week 13 matchup against the Saints, Brady threw a touchdown pass to Rachaad White with three seconds remaining to complete a 13-point comeback.[466] This was the second time in Brady's career that he had surmounted a fourth quarter deficit of 13-plus points, the first being versus the Falcons in Super Bowl LI when the Patriots came back after being down 28\u20133 to win in overtime.[467]\n\nIn Week 17, against the Panthers, he passed for 432 yards and three touchdowns in the 30\u201324 victory.[468] In Week 18 against the Falcons, Brady broke his own NFL record for completions in a season, as well as Matthew Stafford's 2012 record for pass attempts in a season.[469] However, the Buccaneers lost 30\u201317, giving Brady his first career losing season as the starter.[470] 2022 marked the first season in which Brady lost eight or more games.[471] Brady was pulled in the second quarter to prevent injury, as the Buccaneers had clinched their playoff position the previous week by winning the NFC South.[472] Against the Dallas Cowboys in the Wild Card Round, Brady passed for 351 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception in the 31\u201314 loss.[473] In the loss, Brady set postseason single-game franchise records for pass attempts (66) and pass completions (35).[474][475] The loss to the Cowboys marked the first time since 2013 that Brady lost in the playoffs in consecutive seasons.\n\nRetirement\n\nOn February 1, 2023, Brady announced on social media that he was retiring \"for good\".[476] He filed his retirement papers with the NFL and NFLPA nine days later.[477] During a halftime ceremony on September 10, 2023, the Patriots' first game of the season, Robert Kraft announced he would waive the traditional four-year post-retirement waiting period required for Brady's candidacy to the Patriots Hall of Fame, as well as directly inducting him without the customary ballot. His induction took place on June 12, 2024 (the date chosen in reference for the number of championships Brady won in New England, as June is the sixth month of the year, and with his jersey number representing the day), in the first Patriots Hall of Fame induction ceremony to take place within Gillette Stadium.[478][479] Brady was the first person in Gillette Stadium history to become a \"Keeper of the Light\", ringing the bell in the newly redesigned lighthouse.[480][481] In the presence of his family, former teammates, coaches, friends, as well as a crowd of over 60,000 fans at Gillette Stadium, the Patriots celebrated Brady's career with the franchise in a dedicated three-hour event. After speaker panels and video tributes, he was inducted as the 35th member of the Patriots Hall of Fame. Brady delivered a heartfelt speech to the crowd, declaring: \"All our lives take us on different journeys, they take us to different places, they bring different people into our lives, but one thing I am sure of \u2014 and that will never change \u2014 is that I am a Patriot for life.\"[482][483]\n\nIn an Instagram post in December 2023, reflecting on the year, Brady stated that he heavily considered un-retiring a second time in May 2023 to play the 2023 season but was \"forced\" to decide against it when his friends hosted a surprise retirement party for him.[484]\n\nOn June 12, 2024, prior to the induction ceremony, Governor Maura Healey declared June 12 officially \"Tom Brady Day\" in Massachusetts.[485] Kraft announced that the franchise would formally retire Brady's number 12 jersey and revealed that a 12-foot-tall (3.7 m) statue of Brady was being constructed to be placed at the Patriots Hall of Fame building.[486] The statue of Tom Brady, displayed in front of Gillette Stadium, was unveiled in a public ceremony on August 8, 2025.[487][488]\n\nBroadcasting career\n\nOn May 10, 2022, Fox Sports announced that Brady would join the network as the lead color commentator.[489] Brady's deal with Fox will reportedly pay him $375 million over 10 years, making Brady the highest paid sports commentator in history.[12] Brady began his broadcasting career during the 2024 UFL Championship Game's second quarter,[490] and made his NFL on Fox debut alongside play caller Kevin Burkhardt starting with the 2024 NFL season. Brady was also a part of the Fox broadcast team for Super Bowl LIX.[491]\n\nHowever, the NFL has put several restrictions on Brady after he submitted a bid to become part owner of the Las Vegas Raiders. Brady may not attend in-person or online broadcast production meetings, nor is he allowed to have access to team facilities, coaches, or players. He also must follow rules in the NFL constitution and bylaws that prohibit owners or prospective owners from publicly criticizing game officials and other teams.[492] These restrictions were \"relaxed\" prior to the 2025 NFL season where Brady was allowed to attend production meetings remotely and to interview players off-site.[493]\n\nNFL career statistics\n\nLegend AP NFL MVP Super Bowl

and drew two million live viewers.[702]\n\nEndorsements and product development\n\nIn 2007, Brady was a model for the Stetson cologne.[703] He has endorsed brands including Uggs, Under Armour, Movado, Aston Martin and Glaceau Smartwater. Brady earned about $7 million from endorsements in 2014.[704][705] In 2016, he began appearing in a Beautyrest Black commercial campaign for Simmons Bedding Company[706] and launched a line of vegan snacks.[707] In 2016, Brady announced the launch of TB12Sports.com, which features his training regimen information and a store to purchase TB12 merchandise.[708] On August 23, 2016, the TB12 brand expanded to offer a snack line.[709] Brady announced the formation of the TB12 Foundation, a nonprofit to provide free post-injury rehabilitation and training to underprivileged young athletes.[710] In 2017, Brady partnered with meal-kit startup Purple Carrot to offer TB12 Performance Meals. The meals utilize whole foods and focus on providing nutrients for workout recovery.[711][712] In September 2017, Simon & Schuster published Brady's first book The TB12 Method: How to Achieve a Lifetime of Sustained Peak Performance, which became a number one best-seller on Amazon.com[713] and The New York Times weekly Best Sellers list.[714] In 2021, Brady endorsed Subway and its partnership with Hero Bread, a company that produces low-net-carb baked goods in which he is an investor.[715]\n\nIn 2021, Brady and Richard Rosenblatt co-founded a sports-based NFT platform called Autograph.[716] Autograph reached a deal with DraftKings for exclusive distribution on Autograph's sports products, creating the DraftKings Marketplace.[717] In January 2021, Autograph announced it raised $170M in funding.[718] In 2023, the company announced layoffs for nearly a third of its workforce.[719] On September 6, 2023, it was announced that Delta Air Lines had hired Brady as a strategic advisor.[720] In January 2024, Brady agreed to merge his health and apparel brands with NoBull and to become its second largest shareholder.[721][722]\n\nAlso in 2021, Brady, among other athletes and celebrities, was a paid spokesperson for FTX, a cryptocurrency exchange. In 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, wiping out billions of dollars in customer funds. He, alongside other spokespeople, is being sued through a class-action lawsuit, for promoting unregistered securities.[723][724][725] In February 2022, the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit against Bitconnect that the Securities Act of 1933 extends to targeted solicitation using social media.[726] In 2023, it was reported Brady owned 1 million shares in FTX, and he and his wife lost an estimated combined value of $45 million when FTX went bankrupt.[727]\n\nIn November 2025, Brady announced that blood drawn from his family's elderly dog prior to its death was used in non-invasive cloning technology.

After winning three races in 2024, the team became world champions.[735]\n\nBrady participated in The Match, a charity golf event featuring professional golfers and other athletes, from 2020-2022.[736][737][738]\n\nPersonal life\n\nBrady riding a bicycle for charity at the Best Buddies Ride in Hyannis, Massachusetts, in May 2009\n\nBrady was raised Catholic, but in a 2015 interview, expressed he was less religious than spiritual.[739]\n\nDuring his career with the Patriots, Brady and his family lived in the Boston suburb of Brookline, Massachusetts, and in New York City.[740] They own several homes and spend time during the summer at the Yellowstone Club near Big Sky, Montana, and at their home at Silo Ridge in Amenia, New York.[741][742] When Brady signed with the Buccaneers, he rented a mansion in Tampa, Florida.[743] In December 2020, Brady and B\u00fcndchen reportedly bought a home in Indian Creek, Florida.[744]\n\nFamily and relationships\n\nBrady dated actress Bridget Moynahan from 2004 until December 2006.[745] Brady and Moynahan ended their relationship soon after Moynahan became pregnant.[746] In February 2007, Moynahan confirmed to People magazine that she was more than three months pregnant with Brady's child.[745] Their son, John Edward Thomas \"Jack\" Moynahan,[747] was born in August 2007.[748]\n\nBrady began dating Brazilian model Gisele B\u00fcndchen in December 2006.[749][750] Brady and B\u00fcndchen married on February 26, 2009, in a Catholic ceremony at St. Monica Catholic Church in Santa Monica, California.[751] Together, they have two children: a son, Benjamin Rein Brady, born in 2009,[752] and a daughter, Vivian Lake Brady, born in 2012.[753] In October 2022, the couple announced their divorce.[754]\n\nBrady and baseball player Kevin Youkilis became brothers-in-law in 2012 when Youkilis married Brady's sister Julie.[755] Brady's niece, Maya Brady, is a college softball player for the UCLA Bruins.[756] Brady is a distant cousin of former MLB pitcher and left fielder Pete Meegan.[757]\n\nPolitics\n\nBrady attended the 2004 State of the Union Address as a guest of then-president George W. Bush.[758] Brady told ESPN The Magazine in 2004 that being a U.S. senator would be his \"craziest ambition\".[759][760]\n\nBrady is a friend of President Donald Trump.[761][762][763] At a political event in New Hampshire on the day before the 2016 presidential election, Trump said he had received a call from Brady, and that Brady told him: \"Donald, I support you, you're my friend, and I voted for you.\" After B\u00fcndchen was asked on Instagram whether she and Brady backed Trump, she answered \"NO!\"[764] After a Trump campaign \"Make America Great Again\" cap was photographed in Brady's locker, Brady said B\u00fcndchen told him to not discuss politics anymore, which he thought was a \"good decision\".[765] Brady did not join the Patriots in visiting Trump at the White House in 2017 after their Super Bowl victory, citing \"personal family matters\".[766]\n\nIn an interview on The Howard Stern Show in April 2020, Brady explained that Trump had reached out to him to speak at the 2016 Republican National Convention, and he declined, saying, \"It was uncomfortable for me because you can't undo things, not that I would undo a friendship, but political support is totally different than the support of a friend.\" Brady said he has known Trump since 2001 and that Trump asked him to be a judge in the Miss USA pageant, after Brady led the Patriots to victory in Super Bowl XXXVI. Brady explained that Trump used to come to Patriots games and would call him and golf with him occasionally; however, Brady said he did not see the benefit of getting involved in an event as polarizing as a presidential election.[767] Brady said in 2022 that he had not spoken with Trump in \"years\" and that their relationship had been mischaracterized.[768]\n\nWhile there has been speculation that Brady would run for political office,[769] in a 2015 interview he stated he had no interest in it.[770][771][772] Brady reiterated in 2022 that he would avoid a political career because, \"I don't think anyone's fond of politics these days.\"[768] In 2018, Brady endorsed Republican Helen Brady (no relation) for State Auditor of Massachusetts.[773][774][775]\n\nDiet and lifestyle\n\nBrady's health regimen includes transcendental meditation, yoga, hydrating, an 80/20 diet (meaning 80% alkaline and 20% acidic), early bedtime, resistance training, and neuroplasticity training.[776]\n\nBrady and his family adhere to his controversial and strict diet, dubbed the TB12 Method.[777] Brady advocates a daily water intake in ounces of half of one's body weight in pounds and consumes \"a couple hundred ounces\" daily.[778][779] He avoids most fruits, mushrooms, tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, coffee, Gatorade, white sugar, flour, gluten, dairy, soda, cereal, white rice, potatoes, and bread.[780][781] In 2022, Brady said he prefers a diet consisting of organic food. \"You've got to see the process of food being grown,\" he said. \"If I need nutrients, I need that from soil.\"[768]\n\nOne of Brady's former teammates, tight end Rob Gronkowski, has followed Brady and Alex Guerrero's plant-based diet plan since 2017.[782][78", "images":
