Gimple in a statement read out on Talking Dead on Sunday. \u201cMorgan\u2019s arch on The Walking Dead Season 8 positioned him for the story on Fear,\u201d the EP added. \u201cIt was also important to see Fear\u2018s world and characters through new yet familiar eyes.\u201d\n\nJames\u2019 first day on the FearTWD set will be partially live streamed online it was also announced tonight.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nThe revelation of James\u2019 eventual exit from the mother show came tonight on AMC\u2019s post-TWD chat show, the durable Talking Dead with TWD\u2018s Melissa McBride, new cast member Avi Nash and indefatigable director and Comic Book Men co-star Kevin Smith on the guest couch. Revving up the ratings hopes as well as the hype machine that has been going since executive producer Robert Kirkman first made the crossover official in October at New York Comic-Con, news of the cast announcement was dropped online earlier this weekend as America recovered from its Thanksgiving feast and Black Friday shopping frenzy.\n\nSince the NYCC pronouncement, Kirkman has gone on to specify that the crossover would occur in 2018, which tied off some predictions and opened up others. Kirkman\u2019s statement left the possibility that the crossocer could take place on either the current eighth season of the mother show, the upcoming Season 4 of the prequel of a sorts companion series or the ninth season of the Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus starring TWD next fall.\n\nAndrew Lincoln with Kim Dickens \u2013 our crossover senses are tingling! #FearTWD #TWD pic.twitter.com/pprHTSAMRb \u2014 FearTWD UK (@FearTWD_UK) November 24, 2017\n\nWith production on the fourth season of Fear The Walking Dead about to start in Austin, it made sense for Kirkman, fellow EP Gale Ann Hurd, TWD showrunner Gimple and more of the zombie apocalypse franchise team to get the crossover character news out there ASAP. Once shooting starts on the Kim Dickens, Colman Domingo and Frank Dillane led show in and around the music friendly town, fans and others would undoubtedly start sharing photos online of actors spotted on the FearTWD set, undermining any surprise. Add to that, the link between TWD and the Kirkman and Dave Erickson co-created FearTWD became all the stronger of late with Gimple joining the latter as a producer for the first time.\n\nA tightly held secret, as so many things TWD related are, the crossover prospects received deflective responses from both Walking Dead star Reedus and now former FearTWD showrunner Erickson when Deadline inquired in separate interviews.\n\nHowever, as the city of Houston seemed to be mentioned several times in the FearTWD Season 3 finale back on October 15, fans could not stop speculating. Amidst the probable characters to make the leap, if bookies were taking bets, the good money would have been on Michael Cudlitz\u2019s Abraham Ford not James \u2013 even after TWD EP Greg Nicotero appeared to take the juice out of those odds late last month.\n\nWhile killed off along with Steven Yeun\u2019s Glenn Rhee by villain Negan in the TWD Season 7 opener last year, the Texas originating ex-Army sergeant character would perfectly fit into the FearTWD timeline, which is more than an hop, skip and a Walker bite behind the first show.\n\nAnother factor that seemed to warm the multitude of scenarios up was the appearance last week on TWD of a helicopter. Absent from tonight\u2019s mainly somber and then temporarily stereo speaker rich \u201cThe King, The Widow and Rick\u201d episode, the helicopter flies over the distance issue that seemingly logistically grounded any crossover between Georgia and Virginia based TWD and the California then Mexico and soon Lone Star State set FearTWD. Whether that bird, so to speak, becomes a factor or not is TBD on TWD.\n\nTWD wraps up its 2017 run in two weeks with a winter finale on December 10. The show will return for the rest of Season 8 in early 2018. Season 4 of Fear The Walking Dead is expected to debut mid-2018.", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/lennie-james-walking-dead.jpg?w=300", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/walking-dead-feartwd-crossover-logo.jpg?w=1024", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/michael-culditz-twd_701_gp_0504_0004-rt.jpg?w=605", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/build/images/logo-black.svg", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/the-walking-dead-fear-the-walking-dead.jpg?w=605", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/walking-dead-feartwd-crossover-logo.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/walking-dead-feartwd-crossover-logo.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dominic Patten", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2017/11/the-walking-dead-crossover-character-revealed-lennie-james-fear-the-walking-dead-robert-kirkman-amc-1202214715/", "title": "\u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 & \u2018FearTWD\u2019 Crossover Will Feature Lennie James On Spinoff", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The upcoming crossover between 'TWD' &amp; 'FearTWD' will center on the Morgan character, it was revealed tonight on 'Talking Dead'", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Dominic Patten", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 & \u2018FearTWD\u2019 Crossover Will Feature Lennie James On Spinoff", "url": "https://deadline.com/2017/11/the-walking-dead-crossover-character-revealed-lennie-james-fear-the-walking-dead-robert-kirkman-amc-1202214715/", "description": "The upcoming crossover between 'TWD' & 'FearTWD' will center on the Morgan character, it was revealed tonight on 'Talking Dead'", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/walking-dead-feartwd-crossover-logo.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 1024, "alt": "'The Walking Dead' & 'FearTWD' Reveals Crossover Character"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-27T03:44:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2024-12-19T00:27:18+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The upcoming crossover between 'TWD' & 'FearTWD' will center on the Morgan character, it was revealed tonight on 'Talking Dead'", "site": "@Deadline", "creator": "@DeadlineDominic", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018The Walking Dead\u2019 & \u2018FearTWD\u2019 Crossover Will Feature Lennie James On Spinoff", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/walking-dead-feartwd-crossover-logo.jpg?w=1024"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511754242.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
