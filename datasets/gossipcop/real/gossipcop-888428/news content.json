How does the only non-MCU Marvel flick on the 2021 docket fare against all the previous Marvel flicks?\n\n62. \u201cFantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\u201d\n\nJust a nightmare. A total nightmare. There have been a number of bad superhero movies, but from the talking gas cloud the filmmakers cast as Galactus to Jessica Alba\u2018s dye job, this one transcends bad.\n\n61. \u201cX-Men Origins: Wolverine\u201d\n\nA totally chaotic stir fry of nonsense that tells the story of how Wolverine got his claws. Features an early version of Deadpool (also played by Ryan Reynolds) whose mouth is stapled shut, which should tell you all you need to know about it.\n\n60. \u201cElektra\u201d\n\nThat five minutes when they tried to turn Jennifer Garner into an action star went about as well as it should have.\n\n59. \u201cX-Men: The Last Stand\u201d\n\nJust a total mess, incoherent from the word \u201cgo.\u201d After losing director of the first two X-Men films Brian Singer to the first Superman reboot attempt, replacement Matthew Vaughn gave way to eventual director Brett Ratner, who might have killed off the superhero genre entirely were \u201cSpider-Man\u201d not blowing up the box office.\n\n58. \u201cFantastic Four\u201d (2015)\n\nThere could maybe have been a good movie in here somewhere \u2014 the cast (Michael B Jordan, Miles Teller, Kate Mara) certainly warranted one. But this Frankenstein of a film is a behind-the-scenes horror story, and you can see it in the totally disjointed final product.\n\n57. \u201cDaredevil\u201d\n\nThis was basically \u201cEarly-2000s: The Movie,\u201d with Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell and Michael Clark Duncan as the main players. The cherry on top of this turd sundae was that damn Evanescence song.\n\n56. \u201cFantastic Four\u201d (2005)\n\nTim Story\u2018s first \u201cFantastic Four\u201d is just sort of there, challenging you to remember it exists. With Chris Evans, who played the Human Torch here, going on to embody Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that gets tougher every year.\n\n55. \u201cThe Punisher\u201d (2004)\n\nThis is the Punisher as a straight revenge thriller, and it\u2019s not bad. Thomas Jane performs admirably, but the whole thing is missing that extra something that would have elevated it beyond standard genre fare. Setting it in Tampa didn\u2019t help.\n\n54. \u201cSpider-Man 3\u201d\n\nMaybe the bad outweighs the good here, but Emo Peter Parker\u2019s dance number remains one of the greatest single moments in any comic book movie, sorry, haters.\n\n53. \u201cHoward the Duck\u201d\n\nA notorious flop at the box office and, yeah, it\u2019s not exactly \u201cgood.\u201d But now, 30 years removed from its premiere, \u201cHoward the Duck\u201d is pretty fun as a relic of the \u201980s.\n\n52. \u201cThe Punisher\u201d (1989)\n\nDolph Lundgren and Louis Gossett Jr. star in a low-rent \u201980s grunge C-level classic. This one\u2019s all novelty value.\n\n51. \u201cGhost Rider\u201d\n\nFor a movie starring Nic Cage about a dude who rides a Harley and turns into a flaming skeleton, this is a surprisingly mundane movie.\n\n50. \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man\u201d\n\nWe may never figure out what went wrong with Marc Webb\u2018s Spider-Man duology, but his choice of Andrew Garfield to play Peter Parker is still brilliant. It just sucks that this movie doesn\u2019t really make any sense.\n\n49. \u201cX-Men\u201d\n\nThe beginning of the current wave of theatrical superhero movies, \u201cX-Men\u201d was kind of a cheapie and it showed. Novel at the time, now it just comes off as unremarkable mid-budget action fare as Fox was merely sticking its toe in the superhero waters. Timid.\n\n48. \u201cThe Incredible Hulk\u201d\n\nEvery time I watch this one I spend the first 45 minutes or so wondering if maybe it\u2019s secretly good. The rest of the movie then demonstrates pretty clearly that no, it is not secretly good.\n\n47. \u201cThor\u201d\n\nThe fantasy Marvel movie is directed by Kenneth Branagh, who covers the whole movie in canted angle shots and theatrical stylings. It\u2019s pretty boring, also, but at least it looks cool.\n\n46. \u201cThe Amazing Spider-Man 2\u201d\n\nMore of the same impossible-to-follow hack-n\u2019-slash plotting from the previous movie, offset by Andrew Garfield continuing to be awesome and Jamie Foxx going way over the top as the big bad.\n\n45. \u201cThor: The Dark World\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Dark World,\u201d in contrast to the first \u201cThor\u201d movie, is certainly not boring. If anything, it suffers the opposite problem, going so hard and fast that it loses substance.\n\n44. \u201cBlade: Trinity\u201d\n\nStarring a pre-Deadpool Ryan Reynolds basically playing a vampire-slaying Deadpool, throwing out one-liners like his mama\u2019s life depended on it, this may not a \u201cgood\u201d movie, but it sure is fun.\n\n43. \u201cX2: X-Men United\u201d\n\nA big step up from the first \u201cX-Men\u201d both in production values and quality, it still lacks much in the way of energy. Which is inexcusable when you\u2019ve got Alan Cumming as the teleporting mutant Nightcrawler all over your movie.\n\n42. \u201cSpider-Man\u201d\n\nSam Raimi assembled the prototypical superhero movie with this first entry in the \u201cSpider-Man\u201d franchise, in 2002. Like \u201cX-Men\u201d before it, \u201cSpider-Man\u201d is a bit underwhelming today, but unlike \u201cX-Men\u201d it was proud of its nerd roots.\n\n41. \u201cX-Men: Apocalypse\u201d\n\nCould have been a bizarre ironic summer classic if it were structured like a real movie and had any character development whatsoever. Instead it\u2019s just a shot of visual adrenaline that I\u2019ll probably want to revisit at some point \u2014 but not when I\u2019m sober\n\n40. \u201cAvengers: Age of Ultron\u201d \u201cUltron\u201d is frustrating for what it lacks \u2014 chiefly the feeling that it\u2019s advancing the overall story arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But as with the first \u201cAvengers\u201d movie its weaknesses are overcome by great character work.\n\n39. \u201cThe Avengers\u201d\n\nThe story is a total mess, relying heavily on moviegoers\u2019 memories of previous MCU films (if you didn\u2019t remember or know coming in what the Tesseract was, hoo boy). But the novelty of the Marvel\u2019s first big superhero team-up was irresistible, and director Joss Whedon balanced his ensemble expertly, giving everyone plenty to do so none of them ever fades into the background.\n\n38. \u201cGhost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance\u201d\n\nFor the sequel, they tapped the \u201cCrank\u201d director duo known as Neveldine/Taylor. It was an inspired choice, because \u201cSpirit of Vengeance\u201d was exactly as nutty as you\u2019d hope a PG-13 comic book movie would be. Shame that it was apparently stressful enough to break up the tandem of Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor.\n\n37. \u201cCaptain America: The First Avenger\u201d\n\nA lot of folks like to complain that all superhero movies are the same. But this was actually a pretty good World War II movie, too.\n\n36. \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d\n\nPlot-wise, it never really adds up to anything, but the strength of the cast and the bizarre world they explore more than make up for it.\n\n35. \u201cThe New Mutants\u201d It\u2019s an absolutely serviceable little piece of entertainment, and there\u2019s a lot of novelty in its overall strange vibe. But after years of delays and reshoots you can definitely feel the hand of the focus group a bit too much.\n\n34. \u201cBlade 2\u201d\n\nBeloved nerd Guillermo del Toro took over for this one and ramped everything up to 11. More vampires, more blood, more people getting sliced up \u2014 and of course baddies whose jaws can split open and swallow a person\u2019s head whole.\n\n33. \u201cBig Hero 6\u201d\n\nDisney Animation Studios made a Marvel movie, and it\u2019s really sweet. Sure, it\u2019s the kiddie version of Marvel, but that doesn\u2019t prevent it from being a wholly satisfying experience.\n\n32. \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s fine, but \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d feels like a movie from before Marvel Studios really hit its stride in Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Right now it\u2019s a movie that seems very much out of place.\n\n31. \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy vol. 2\u201d\n\nAn improvement on the first film, and an absolute delight from moment to moment \u2014 but it never quite coalesces into a coherent whole because so many subplots distract from the core story and rob it of its emotional impact. Would be a top 5 comic book movie if it had just reigned in the plot.\n\n30. \u201cIron Man\u201d\n\nIt was Robert Downey Jr.\u2018s reemergence on the big screen, and he\u2019s flawless in this origin story that takes Tony Stark from billionaire playboy weapons manufacturer to billionaire playboy other-things manufacturer.\n\n29. \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d\n\nThis movie is, frustratingly, far from perfect. In fact, it\u2019s kind of a huge mess. But it\u2019s also awesome and thrilling and hilarious and contains some individual moments that are perfect. I wish it was better, but with everything required of a movie that exists to wrap up 21 movies\u2019 worth of story arcs, I\u2019m glad it\u2019s as good as it is.\n\n28. \u201cHulk\u201d\n\nIn 2003 the modern wave of superhero movies was still in its infancy, and Ang Lee \u2014 still the best filmmaker to do a comic book movie \u2014 got experimental with \u201cHulk.\u201d And what he made was an incredible melodrama with visual stylings meant to ape comic book panels. It didn\u2019t sit well with audiences, but \u201cHulk\u201d remains one of the most compelling and interesting Marvel movies to date.\n\n27. \u201cThe Wolverine\u201d\n\nThis was, like, just a legitimately enjoyable melodramatic action movie. Sure, it turns into a video game boss battle by the end, but for most of its running time it\u2019s just an actual movie.\n\n26. \u201cPunisher: War Zone\u201d\n\nWhereas the previous \u201cPunisher\u201d movie was melodramatic and contemplative, this one is just murderous. And it\u2019s awesome.\n\n25. \u201cX-Men: Days of Future Past\u201d\n\nIts time travel logic is a bit iffy, but \u201cDays of Future Past\u201d is still tremendously entertaining because, while epic, it\u2019s not overly serious. As \u201cBack to the Future\u201d taught us long ago, you can get away with a lot of logical leaps if you strike the right tone.\n\n24. \u201cBlade\u201d\n\nPure B-movie trash, which is fine because that\u2019s precisely what it aims for: bloody, crass, awesome. It\u2019s tough to imagine an MCU version of the character working this well.\n\n23. \u201cIron Man 2\u201d\n\nSwaps Terrence Howard for Don Cheadle, while Mickey Rourke breaks cars with laser whips. It\u2019s a huge mess, but the personalities involved \u2014 looking at you, Sam Rockwell \u2014 make it fun anyway.\n\n22. \u201cDeadpool\u201d\n\nIn the angsty and angry times we live in, \u201cDeadpool\u201d is perfect. Aggressively violent and flippantly meanspirited, it\u2019s the exact emotional release we needed.\n\n21. \u201cX-Men: Dark Phoenix\u201d\n\nThe main series \u201cX-Men\u201d movies have never achieved any sort of greatness, but at least \u201cDark Phoenix\u201d ends the whole thing with one of the best efforts of the bunch. And that sequence on the train in the third act is easily the best action sequence of these movies.\n\n20. \u201cSpider-Man: Far From Home\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s frustrating that it doesn\u2019t really deal with the immense fallout from \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d but it\u2019s still as visually creative as any movie in the MCU, and Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s Mysterio is an all-timer of a villain. Dude goes all the way out in this.\n\n19. \u201cX-Men: First Class\u201d\n\nThe first \u201cX-Men\u201d movie that could be described as \u201cfun.\u201d It\u2019s basically two movies crammed into one, story-wise, but director Matthew Vaughn\u2018s touch is so breezy and enjoyable that it totally works anyway, thanks in large part to a brilliant cast that includes Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and James McAvoy.\n\n18. \u201cShang-Chi\u201d There\u2019s some amount of \u201cbit off more than they could chew\u201d with this one because there is so much stuff we\u2019ve never heard of that needs explaining \u2014 the classic origin story problem. But the action is unbelievable, and probably the best and most interesting we\u2019ve seen in the MCU in that regard. If they can hold on to director Destin Daniel Cretton I bet the second movie, unburdened from those standard first movie issues, is gonna rip.\n\n17. \u201cSpider-Man: Homecoming\u201d\n\nNot quite the best \u201cSpider-Man\u201d movie, but still an absolute delight, with a cast full of scene stealers. Michael Keaton as the Vulture makes for one of the best Marvel villains ever.\n\n16. \u201cDeadpool 2\u201d While you may get whiplash from the \u201cDeadpool\u201d sequel\u2019s occasional very serious and emo scenes, the rest of the movie is thoroughly delightful, somehow managing to be even funnier \u2014 and more hilariously violent \u2014 than the original.\n\n15. \u201cAnt-Man\u201d\n\n\u201cAnt-Man\u201d represented a first for the MCU by being a straight-up comedy. And it\u2019s a very good one, with a cast that\u2019s perfectly suited for it. Aside from Paul Rudd who plays Ant-Man himself, Michael Pena is the true standout as Scott Lang\u2019s best friend and former cellmate.\n\n14. \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s ever so slightly frustrating that this one doesn\u2019t fully integrate into the \u201cInfinity War\u201d situation, but even so it\u2019s thoroughly a delight. Evangeline Lilly is so good at the Wasp that I\u2019m retroactively irritated that she didn\u2019t don the suit in the previous \u201cAnt-Man\u201d movie.\n\n13. \u201cVenom\u201d\n\nHow can anybody resist the pull of Tom Hardy doing comedy? It\u2019s not completely sure of itself \u2014 it feels like there\u2019s a version of this on a hard drive somewhere that\u2019s much more serious \u2014 but Venom works so incredibly well as comic foil that it doesn\u2019t matter. Who knew that Venom would be so much more fun without Spider-Man?\n\n12. \u201cDoctor Strange\u201d\n\nIf it weren\u2019t hamstrung with all the requisite elements of an origin story, \u201cDoctor Strange\u201d might have been the best Marvel movie ever. That\u2019s the power of the astonishing visual imagination on display here. People love to talk about the nebulous concept of capturing some long lost childlike sense of wonder though the magic of cinema \u2014 \u201cDoctor Strange\u201d is one of the only movies I\u2019ve watched as an adult that really accomplishes that.\n\n11. \u201cSpider-Man 2\u201d\n\nThis is a movie that fully understands its main character and taps into what made him such a captivating figure for so long. Yeah, Peter Parker\u2019s a superhero, but he\u2019s also a college kid working a minimum wage job to make rent while also taking university physics classes. Peter buckles under the pressure, something we can all relate to.\n\n10. \u201cIron Man 3\u201d\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned this is the \u201cIron Man\u201d movie. Somehow, Shane Black was able to infiltrate the MCU and make a legitimate Shane Black movie with all the wit and raw humanity you\u2019d expect from him.\n\n9. \u201cThor: Ragnarok\u201d A thorough delight. This might be the most fun we had at the movies in all of 2017, and so we can\u2019t help but love it.\n\n8. \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d\n\nMultiply the two previous best Marvel movies by one another and you get \u201cCivil War.\u201d It packs the sort of emotional payoff all the disconnected Marvel movies can\u2019t really provide. And as an action film it\u2019s easily the best of the superhero genre.\n\n7. \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d\n\nYou could certainly make the argument that \u201cInfinity War\u201d does not really hold up on as a complete movie on its own, because it kinda begins with the second act. But I don\u2019t care. The culmination of this ten-year shared universe experiment should stand on the shoulders of the movies that came before it. The fact that it packs such a profound emotional punch, however, is what really makes it work.\n\n6. \u201cVenom: Let There Be Carnage\u201d With a better handle on its tone than the original \u2014 this one knows it\u2019s a comedy first \u2014 the \u201cVenom\u201d sequel is alarmingly delightful. It\u2019s not just a comedy, though. It\u2019s a romantic comedy. A love story about a real boy and an amoeba. There\u2019s never been anything like this before in the annals of comic book movie history.\n\n5. \u201cBlack Widow\u201d Natasha\u2019s long-overdue solo is held back a little by some fully unnecessary trademark Marvel CGI nonsense, but otherwise this film has a vibe that is fully it\u2019s own thing. It does away with the Marvel house style, aside from in two big action sequences, in favor of a low-key indie look that feels so much more intimate than any previous MCU flick.\n\n4. \u201cBlack Panther\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s held back a little by being saddled with standard \u201corigin movie\u201d issues \u2014 introducing audiences to the world of Wakanda isn\u2019t a quick and easy task, and it could use an extra 15-20 minutes to flesh out the supporting characters \u2014 but still manages to be the most substantial superhero movie ever. It\u2019s kind of amazing that Disney let writer/director Ryan Coogler make this overt a political statement \u2014 it might be the most openly political mega-budget movie I\u2019ve ever seen. Also, while I\u2019m listing superlatives: Michael B Jordan delivers the best performance ever in a superhero movie. Good lord.\n\n3. \u201cLogan\u201d\n\nJames Mangold\u2019s small-scale western is a game changer for the entire superhero genre, daring to defy pretty much standard by which you expect these movies to operate. It\u2019s just a great movie by any normal standard. Where \u201cCivil War\u201d elevated the genre, \u201cLogan\u201d opts instead to be something else entirely and we\u2019re all the better for it.\n\n2. \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u201d The best superhero movies, and movies in general, are the ones that are truly most human. And \u201cSpider-Verse,\u201d despite being animated, despite the wacky cast of Spider-People, despite the outlandish premise, is as real as movies get.", "images":
