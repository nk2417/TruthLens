(This is a girl who recently dressed up as naked cyborg version of herself, after all.) But there is one very important piece of information in the video that may settle the \"Who is this damn song about?\" debate for good, and it all has to do with the song's most controversial lyric, which was apparently changed between the original and final version.\n\nThe phrase that made it into the song (and sparked a million Swift vs. Harris comment wars on social media) is \"I've got a boyfriend, he's older than us / he's at the club doing I don't know what.\" It makes it seem like she's referencing Calvin Harris, the DJ she dated in 2015. He's older than she is, it's his job to be at a club\u2026the shoe more or less fits. But as we learn from the behind-the-scenes footage, the line was originally written as, \"I've got a boyfriend, he's older than us / I haven't seen him in a couple of months.\"\n\nWatch, below:", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/6883ef8475f8cc4034148a50/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691f2ed14cb29dcf6ca1cb2f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/thegiftshop.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691f911b5b3549baa545fef2/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691e3686eb3e44ce0f485e3d/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691f6dab320fa7d05038761a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_640%2Cq_80%2Cw_640/v1481599096/glamour_taylor-swift-a-look-back-at-where-it-all-started.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691f5e955b3549baa545fecb/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691f6ebe6e41b33ae16b4512/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59fa0524110b841b972edb01/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/taylor-swift-walking-getty-images.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f9f3f9110b841b972edaf7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68ed31f0a4fe9188be0eb71c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691cd422c9cdcfd0f1db5911/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/logo-oneNav.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68f81ea7274bee3a27843711/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691f3a62e9f454e9f2de60c1/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f9f3f9110b841b972edaf7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zoe Weiner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/taylor-swift-shares-songwriting-process-behind-gorgeous", "title": "Taylor Swift Shares the Songwriting Process Behind 'Gorgeous' in This New Video", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Zoe Weiner", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Taylor Swift released a behind-the-scenes video of the making of 'Gorgeous,' complete with never-before-heard original lyrics.", "id": "59f9ef54a8a1e11bce94e041", "keywords": "taylor swift,reputation,music", "news_keywords": "taylor swift,reputation,music", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59f9ef54a8a1e11bce94e041", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Taylor Swift released a behind-the-scenes video of the making of 'Gorgeous,' complete with never-before-heard original lyrics.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59fa0524110b841b972edb01/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/taylor-swift-walking-getty-images.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59fa0524110b841b972edb01/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/taylor-swift-walking-getty-images.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Tay, stop messing with us!", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f9f3f9110b841b972edaf7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Taylor Swift Just Revealed the Original Lyrics for 'Gorgeous,' and It Changes Everything", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/taylor-swift-shares-songwriting-process-behind-gorgeous"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-11-01T17:34:48.742Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-01T17:34:48.742Z", "author": "Zoe Weiner"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "Tay, stop messing with us!", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f9f3f9110b841b972edaf7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/taylor.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Taylor Swift Just Revealed the Original Lyrics for 'Gorgeous,' and It Changes Everything"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f9f3f9110b841b972edaf7/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/taylor.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509557688.742, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
