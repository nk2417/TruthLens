Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter that she has inked a three-year pact to remain on the series, which ranks as the most watched drama in the world.\n\nBello, who will make her debut in the fourth episode of the season, will play an NCIS agent who was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the army and served two tours in Afghanistan. After joining NCIS, she built her reputation as the agency\u2019s premier forensic psychologist. Unlike the other agents, she can second-guess and challenge Gibbs (series star Mark Harmon), so there will be friction but also mutual respect. She is a positive force, mischievous and at times acerbic.\n\n\u201cWe have always been big fans of Maria Bello\u2019s work and are excited to be introducing her as an agent who not only has a distinct talent, but also a unique relationship with Gibbs,\u201d NCIS executive producers George Schenck and Frank Cardea said.\n\nNCIS marks Bello\u2019s return to TV following roles in Amazon\u2019s Goliath, Fox\u2019s Touch and NBC\u2019s Prime Suspect and ER. On the film side, her credits include The Cooler, A History of Violence and World Trade Center. She\u2019s repped by UTA, John Carrabino Management and attorney Bob Myman.\n\nSeason 15 of NCIS premieres Tuesday, Sept. 26 at 8 p.m. on CBS.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-628071256_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-628071256_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Goldberg", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/maria-bello-joins-ncis-as-series-regular-season-15-1024761/", "title": "Maria Bello Joins \u2018NCIS\u2019 as Series Regular for Season 15", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Sources note the actress has inked a three-year deal for the most watched drama in the world.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Lesley Goldberg", "tags": "Fall TV Preview, Maria Bello, NCIS", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Maria Bello Joins \u2018NCIS\u2019 as Series Regular for Season 15", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/maria-bello-joins-ncis-as-series-regular-season-15-1024761/", "description": "Sources note the actress has inked a three-year deal for the most watched drama in the world.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-628071256_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Maria Bello Joins 'NCIS' Series Regular Season 15"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-27T11:30:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-27T12:51:33+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Sources note the actress has inked a three-year deal for the most watched drama in the world.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Maria Bello Joins \u2018NCIS\u2019 as Series Regular for Season 15", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-628071256_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501155000.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
