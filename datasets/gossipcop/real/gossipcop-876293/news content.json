Taylor Swift may have just revealed who is still in her squad. In the singer\u2019s latest music video, \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d the star wears a T-shirt that features the names of several of her famous pals.\n\nIn the video, which MTV debuted during the Video Music Awards on Sunday, August 27, Swift, 26, recreated the \u201cJunior Jewels\u201d top that she wore during her 2008 \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d music video.\n\nRelated: Taylor Swift\u2019s Red Carpet Style Evolution From cowboy boots to Jimmy Choos!

There are certain places you can\u2019t go together. Certain things you can\u2019t do. There are these different sets of considerations within the friendship,\u201d Lorde told The Guardian. She later tweeted: \u201cDidn\u2019t mention taylor, but regardless, i f\u2013ked up & that was really insensitive.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity BFFs Check out photos of Hollywood's hottest famous
