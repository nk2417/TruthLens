I will now do all grocery shopping like this pic.twitter.com/DLAzKvDezI \u2014 chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017\n\nThere was also a dog dressed a bellhop in the background, because why not?\n\nyes my dog is a bellhop and no I have no reasoning \u2014 chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017\n\nA couple of hours passed without incident until the mum-of-one realised that she needed just one more banana for her famous banana bread.\n\nI really, really hate to say this but. I need one more banana pic.twitter.com/DBqKjQpSM7 \u2014 chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017\n\nShe tweeted a guy called Jake who she had been in touch with earlier that day. Jake had two bananas he was willing to sacrifice to the cause.\n\nmy mom just goes \"if I go he better have 2 bananas I not going in traffic for 1\" she's like a real dealer \u2014 chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) September 21, 2017\n\nJake looked only delighted to be receiving a pair of John Legend\u2019s underwear, too.\n\none of the cutest things I've ever seen @onairjake

22, 2017\n\nThankfully, Chrissy then had enough bananas to continue with her banana bread.\n\nShe expressed her gratitude for the help Twitter had given her.\n\nShe then posted a couple of videos of the finished banana bread.\n\nAnd, to be fair to her, it does look pretty unreal.\n\nFair play, Chrissy.", "images": ["https://her.ie/uploads/2025/04/colin-farrell.png?height=225&width=450&cropped",
