What is being a Backstreet Boy? It\u2019s wearing a fedora and dancing on some tarmac. I think I got it.\u201d\n\nFollowing Brian Littrell\u2019s insistence that Corden could not handle the costume changes, Corden let the members vote on whom he replaces. Corden then decided that he should take Littrell\u2019s place onstage. \u201cShow me the meaning of being lonely,\u201d Corden said, referencing another song off the album, as Littrell exited the dressing room.\n\nFollowing Littrell\u2019s forced departure, Corden tried to learn the choreography for the performance. He also took the liberty of suggesting new dance moves. When asked when he should do the worm, Howie Dorough responded, \u201cMaybe after the show.\u201d\n\nDespite resistance from the bandmembers, Corden eventually took on the role of choreographer and incorporated a number of new dance moves, including the band lifting him up during \u201cLarger Than Life.\u201d When they perfected the lift, Corden instructed, \u201cAnd then you guys disappear \u2019til the end of the song.\u201d\n\nNot only did Corden take over for the performance, but he also attended the band\u2019s meet and greet. When taking a group photo with a fan, Corden flipped the iPhone camera and instead took a selfie. He then blocked a fan in another photo.\n\nCorden led a prayer circle before he and the Backstreet Boys took the stage. \u201cDear Lord, heavenly Jesus. I know what you\u2019re thinking. What\u2019s Brian doing there? We\u2019re thinking the same,\u201d he said. \u201cMake us strong. Show us the meaning of being lonely. Quit playing games with out hearts. Give us the call and know that everybody.\u201d After a moment of silence, he added, \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other Backstreet Boys songs. We want it that way. We want it that way!\u201d\n\nThe sketch then cut to the performance, in which a photo of Littrell onstage was been replaced with one of Corden. The band then appeared and began to sing \u201cLarger Than Life\u201d while the musicians are suspended on platforms in the air. Littrell eventually joined the group onstage. Corden then ran to the front of the stage and showed off his best dance moves, including the running man and the worm, as the band sang behind him.\n\nThe performance concluded when Corden thanked fans for coming and told them to drive home safe. Richardson then explained that they had 22 more songs to perform. \u201cI quit the band,\u201d Corden responded before walking offstage.\n\nAmid the release of their new single \u201cDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart,\u201d the band is also headlining a Las Vegas residency, Backstreet Boys: Larger Than Life. This year, the group celebrated its 25th anniversary.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/111599_0076b2_copy_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/111599_0076b2_copy_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Schaffstall", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/backstreet-boys-james-corden-perform-late-late-show-larger-life-1129668/", "title": "Backstreet Boys, James Corden Perform Revamped Single \u201cLate Late-r Than Life\u201d", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The Backstreet Boys and James Corden performed a revamp of their 1999 single &quot;Larger Than Life&quot; during their appearance on CBS\u2019 'The Late Late Show' Tuesday night.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Katherine Schaffstall", "tags": "Backstreet Boys, James Corden, Late Night TV, The Late Late Show", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Backstreet Boys, James Corden Perform Revamped Single \u201cLate Late-r Than Life\u201d", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/backstreet-boys-james-corden-perform-late-late-show-larger-life-1129668/", "description": "The Backstreet Boys and James Corden performed a revamp of their 1999 single \"Larger Than Life\" during their appearance on CBS\u2019 'The Late Late Show' Tuesday night.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/111599_0076b2_copy_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "Backstreet Boys, James Corden Perform Late Late Show Larger Than Life"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-25T08:38:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-29T06:48:05+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Backstreet Boys and James Corden performed a revamp of their 1999 single \"Larger Than Life\" during their appearance on CBS\u2019 'The Late Late Show' Tuesday night.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Backstreet Boys, James Corden Perform Revamped Single \u201cLate Late-r Than Life\u201d", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/111599_0076b2_copy_0.jpg?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532507935.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
