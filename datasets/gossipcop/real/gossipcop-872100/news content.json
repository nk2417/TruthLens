My Next Guest Needs No Introduction will be a six-episode limited series which, unlike most shows within the Netflix purview, will be released one at a time, monthly, rather than all at once. Here's a teaser.\n\nLetterman's been off TV since his widely-publicized retirement in May 2015, which was overshadowed by his even-more-publicized retirement beard. Yeah, it's only been two and a half years. But that's a long time in TV.\n\nA good crop of guests make up the first season: George Clooney, Malala Yousafzai, Jay-Z, Tina Fey, Howard Stern, and freakin' Barack Obama. The first episode is set to hit Netflix on January 12.", "images": ["https://media.gq.com/photos/68f6b41d114bd501a6095302/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/69177a24344e3b09451b198a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/69123075af4418b649f0936e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/69162988b4ee68a44597c2b7/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/691256ebf079c516df9f8690/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/asset-tentpole-moty.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/5d9622fc4afa850008f6a744/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6917a2a8d1c58ee0ad0f4e63/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/68f69dd0114bd501a60952fc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6914c3f415d385d69a340503/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/691762a745be264f86a914bc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/690b7df8dbe7d511764569e4/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6901224d221ed6f4be11e0c6/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/690b7d7277dc569bd7231491/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tom Philip"], "canonical_link": "https://www.gq.com/story/david-lettermans-new-netflix-show-has-some-stellar-guests-lined-up", "title": "David Letterman's New Netflix Show Has Some Stellar Guests Lined Up", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Tom Philip", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "The Late Show standby is back for a six-episode series with some of his most impressive friends.", "id": "5a4fb06878ce215ac7f467d2", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a4fb06878ce215ac7f467d2", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The Late Show standby is back for a six-episode series with some of his most impressive friends.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "'The Late Show' standby is back for a six-episode series with some of his most impressive friends.", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg", "site_name": "GQ", "title": "David Letterman's New Netflix Show Has Some Stellar Guests Lined Up", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gq.com/story/david-lettermans-new-netflix-show-has-some-stellar-guests-lined-up"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-01-05T17:28:22.764Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-05T17:28:22.764Z", "author": "Tom Philip"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@gqmagazine", "description": "'The Late Show' standby is back for a six-episode series with some of his most impressive friends.", "domain": "https://www.gq.com", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@gqmagazine", "title": "David Letterman's New Netflix Show Has Some Stellar Guests Lined Up"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/5a4fb70befd792474cf8cdcb/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/dave-letterman-netflix.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 606963029328755, "pages": 7962048097}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515173302.764, "source": "https://www.gq.com", "summary": ""}
