[It\u2019s] definitely not in my wheelhouse. I danced as a little kid but this is nothing like what I\u2019m going to expect, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\nBurke is a two-time \u201cDWTS\u201d champion who has worked with former NFL players before \u2014 one of her wins was with NFL legend Emmitt Smith.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cIf I can handle Bill Parcells then I can handle Cheryl,\u201d Owens said, referring to his former Dallas Cowboys coach. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to be a challenge. Yesterday we got our first start at trying to learn some steps, so that\u2019s the challenge.\u201d\n\nBurke said Owens is all about \u201clights, camera, action,\u201d which could help them bring home the Mirror Ball trophy.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a performer so I\u2019m definitely going to use that to my advantage,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long we do the work in the studio and really practice hard, then he can do whatever he likes on the dance floor.\u201d\n\nOwens, an Alabama native, played for NFL teams including the San Francisco 49ers, Dallas Cowboys, and Philadelphia Eagles. He ended his 15-year NFL career with 1,078 receptions, 15,935 yards, and 153 touchdowns, according to his website.\n\n\u201cProperty Brothers\u201d star Drew Scott was previously revealed as the first celebrity to compete on the 25th season along with pro partner Emma Slater, who won Season 24 of the competition.\n\nThe full celebrity cast of \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d will be announced on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Wednesday.
