On Thursday night, however, the pop star made his return to the red carpet simply to show his support for his close friend Patrick Schwarzenegger. Though he didn't talk to reporters, Justin did stop for several photos with Patrick on their way into the premiere of Patrick's new movie, Midnight Sun, at Los Angeles's ArcLight Hollywood Theater.\n\nFor the debut of the film, which also stars Bella Thorne, Justin and Patrick went in very different sartorial directions. While Patrick opted for a classic midnight-blue suit with a white button-down and crisp white sneakers, Justin kept it casual. He sported a black sweatshirt by Fear of God, slim-fitting black track pants with bright yellow stripes down the legs and small rips at the knees, and blue-and-yellow printed slip-ons. Yes, Justin wore a sweatshirt and sweatpants to a red carpet.\n\nBefore heading into the theater, Patrick stopped to talk to Entertainment Tonight. \"He's such a great guy,\" Patrick told ET of Justin. \"I'm just really blessed to call him a friend; he's a really great guy.\" He added, \"I'm really happy he came to support me, and I'll support him throughout his life.\"", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68fba7f7daf24cf1ce68ee50/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6915ab5cf123d4b2f5690bc6/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/691f3bb33f93a905713f3fff/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/691251f73c97e98bf9922bc6/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/680b68178d2cdee9ead33b98/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68f66ac930197853ea8fa94a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6904cb0189b8f8cb8d24de9c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5aac0185eedfff3bedcb9bd1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/justin-bieber-patrick-schwarzenegger-red-carpet-fb.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68fa3921d42a2cf2f237c104/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5aabe38d7644ea61b54a1c58/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/justin-bieber-patrick-schwarzenegger-red-carpet-02.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/69138d7bbc6eeda96f4c6446/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5aabe38deedfff3bedcb9bc9/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/justin-bieber-patrick-schwarzenegger-red-carpet-lead.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5aabe38deedfff3bedcb9bc8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/justin-bieber-patrick-schwarzenegger-red-carpet-01.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6904c171934452742846a6d4/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6915dfa80af7af3c9ac600c3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68fd0902da0dbc06fb5df6c3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5aac0185eedfff3bedcb9bd1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/justin-bieber-patrick-schwarzenegger-red-carpet-fb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrea Park"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/justin-bieber-midnight-sun-premiere", "title": "Justin Bieber Supported Patrick Schwarzenegger at the \"Midnight Sun\" Premiere", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Andrea Park", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Justin Bieber attended the premiere of Patrick Schwarzenegger's new movie, \"Midnight Sun,\" in Los Angeles on Thursday in a sweatshirt reading \"Fear of God.\"", "id": "5aabe1e5ee82aa5c3c84ad3c", "keywords": "snd, justin bieber,patrick schwarzenegger,midnight sun", "news_keywords": "snd, justin bieber,patrick schwarzenegger,midnight sun", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5aabe1e5ee82aa5c3c84ad3c", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Justin Bieber attended the premiere of Patrick Schwarzenegger's new movie, \\\"Midnight Sun,\\\" in Los Angeles on Thursday in a sweatshirt reading \\\"Fear of God.\\\"\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5aac01487644ea61b54a1c70/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/justin-bieber-patrick-schwarzenegger-red-carpet-tout.jpeg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5aac01487644ea61b54a1c70/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/justin-bieber-patrick-schwarzenegger-red-carpet-tout.jpeg\"}", "og": {"description": "A look, a vibe, a feeling.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5aac0185eedfff3bedcb9bd1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/justin-bieber-patrick-schwarzenegger-red-carpet-fb.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Justin Bieber Wore a Sweatshirt to His First Red Carpet in 2 Years", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/justin-bieber-midnight-sun-premiere"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-03-16T18:00:43.869Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-16T18:00:43.869Z", "author": "Andrea Park"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "A look, a vibe, a feeling.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5aac0185eedfff3bedcb9bd1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/justin-bieber-patrick-schwarzenegger-red-carpet-fb.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Justin Bieber Wore a Sweatshirt to His First Red Carpet in 2 Years"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5aac0185eedfff3bedcb9bd1/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/justin-bieber-patrick-schwarzenegger-red-carpet-fb.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521223243.869, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
