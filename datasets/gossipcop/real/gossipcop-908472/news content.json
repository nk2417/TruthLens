She suggested that the organization needs to change.\n\n\"Knowing that USA Gymnastics has failed their athletes so terribly disappoints me and makes me so incredibly angry,\" Johnson East said in the video. \"I think the fact that any of this has ever happened shows that USA Gymnastics has failed as a governing body to protect the athletes that it supports and claims to care about.\"\n\nJohnson East is just the latest athlete to criticize the group.\n\nNeed a news break?
