I guess I am a little bit stronger,\u201d the actress, director and philanthropist tells PEOPLE exclusively in an interview for the magazine\u2019s new cover story. \u201cWe all have our difficult times, but as a mother you also have a responsibility first and foremost towards the kids. They are going through their formative years and everything else comes second to that.\u201d\n\nWith her children \u2014 Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, Vivienne and Knox, 9 \u2014 by her side, the superstar, 42, is back at work promoting First They Killed My Father, a movie she directed for Netflix (debuting Sept. 15) based on her friend Loung Ung\u2019s memoir about surviving the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia.\n\nAlexei\u2020 Hay/Netflix\n\nFor all the details on Jolie\u2019s new life, her emotional movie First They Killed My Father and her hopes for her kids, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Angelina Jolie Brings All of Her 6 Kids to Premiere of Her Latest Movie\n\nJolie confirmed she plans on taking on more acting roles in the future, including Maleficent 2, but says her priority remains her children and their well-being.\n\n\u201cEverything will be around the children,\u201d she says. \u201cI haven\u2019t worked for over a year now because they needed me home. Everything was just stopped. I\u2019m really sitting and talking with them because everything affects them. Every location, every type of project, I\u2019m going to have to adjust it to however much they can handle.\u201d\n\nGeorge Pimentel/WireImage\n\nJolie, her kids, author Loung Ung and the young stars of First They Killed My Father at the movie\u2019s Toronto premiere on Sept. 11.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kids Interview Angelina Jolie\n\nIn the interview, an emotional Jolie also talks about how she misses her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who died of cancer 10 years ago, more than ever \u2014and says her own health is good \u201cso far\u201d after her preventative surgeries to lessen the risk of breast and ovarian cancer.\n\nShe\u2019s very proud that Maddox and Pax got involved behind the scenes on First They Killed My Father. The movie grew from her longtime love for Cambodia, where she adopted Maddox in 2002 and where she has done humanitarian work for 14 years, establishing a foundation in Maddox\u2019s name that helps local communities with education, health and more. \u201cI wanted Maddox to see how extraordinary his country is,\u201d she says of the movie.\n\nThough they are still healing from the last year, the star says her family is out of \u201clockdown\u201d and ready for new adventures.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re itching to get out in the world again,\u201d says Jolie. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been a bit in lockdown and going through some things. I think it would be good to get out there and play together.\u201d", "images":
