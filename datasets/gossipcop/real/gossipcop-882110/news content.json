After Riverdale lead KJ Apa was involved in a car crash last Thursday, fans were concerned for the actor\u2019s safety.\n\nBut his close-knit co-stars have taken to social media to reassure the CW show\u2019s stans that Apa, 20, is doing just fine.\n\nInstagram Stories\n\nCamila Mendes, who plays Veronica Lodge, posted a photo of Apa lying on the ground looking at his phone to Instagram Stories late Thursday night, writing, \u201c@kjapa u good?\u201d\n\nAnd Cole Sprouse, who plays Archie\u2019s bestie Jughead Jones, also shared a close-up shot of Apa\u2019s face. The red-headed actor appeared to be in costume, rocking Jugheads signature hat, as the cast films season two.\n\nApa himself posted to Instagram Stories on Thursday from the set, filming his co-star Martin Cummins, who plays Sheriff Keller, at the police station.\n\nApa\u2019s car accident happened last week in Vancouver, Canada, where the show is filmed. The Hollywood Reporter said that Apa had fallen asleep behind the wheel after working a 16-hour day and was then taken the hospital for his injuries in the crash.\n\nInstagram Stories\n\nBut Warner Bros. Television released a statement to ET, direct addressing some of those claims.\n\n\"First and foremost, we are extremely grateful that KJ Apa was uninjured during his recent accident. Secondarily, we want to specifically address the characterization that conditions on the set of Riverdale are of concern,\" reads Warner Bros. Television's statement to ET. \"We have a large cast of series regulars, and our actors do not work every day. On the day of the accident, KJ worked 14.2 hours. The previous day he worked 2.5 hours, and the day before that he worked 7.7 hours. KJ has repeatedly been informed about making production aware if he is tired or feels unsafe, and if so, either a ride or hotel room will be provided for him.\"\n\nThe network also said that Apa was not taken to the hospital, but rather, \u201ctreated by first responders at the scene.\u201d\n\nFor more about the second season of Riverdale, watch the clip below!", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/camila_mendes_kj_apa_gettyimages_820939908.jpg?h=6703819a", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-09/kj_apa_gettyimages-684458910.jpg?h=82b0d4c8&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-07/et_riverdaleseason2_CLIP_072117_1280.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2015-11/640_ben_mckenzie_morena_baccarin_costar_couples_2.jpg?width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/camila_mendes_kj_apa_gettyimages_820939908.jpg?h=6703819a&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/camila_mendes_kj_apa_gettyimages_820939908.jpg?h=6703819a", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/kj-apas-riverdale-co-star-camila-mendes-posts-pic-of-him-following-car-crash-87863", "title": "KJ Apa\u2019s \u2018Riverdale\u2019 Co-Star Camila Mendes Posts Pic of Him Following Car Crash", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/camila_mendes_kj_apa_gettyimages_820939908.jpg?h=6703819a", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Cole Sprouse also shared a photo of Apa on set.", "title": "KJ Apa\u2019s \u2018Riverdale\u2019 Co-Star Camila Mendes Posts Pic of Him Following Car Crash", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kj-apas-riverdale-co-star-camila-mendes-posts-pic-of-him-following-car-crash-87863", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Cole Sprouse also shared a photo of Apa on set.", "twitter": {"description": "Cole Sprouse also shared a photo of Apa on set.", "title": "KJ Apa\u2019s \u2018Riverdale\u2019 Co-Star Camila Mendes Posts Pic of Him Following Car Crash", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kj-apas-riverdale-co-star-camila-mendes-posts-pic-of-him-following-car-crash-87863", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-09/camila_mendes_kj_apa_gettyimages_820939908.jpg?h=6703819a", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "KJ Apa\u2019s \u2018Riverdale\u2019 Co-Star Camila Mendes Posts Pic of Him Following Car Crash | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, TV, KJ Apa, Riverdale, Cole Sprouse", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
