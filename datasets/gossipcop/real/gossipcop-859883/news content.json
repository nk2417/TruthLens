Add in the fact that Underwood\u2019s husband plays for the Nashville Predators, which are competing for the Stanley Cup, and her camera time only went up.\n\nUnderwood is the awards show\u2019s top-winning singer in its history, and she only grew her margin with two wins Wednesday night. In addition to Underwood\u2019s win with Urban, her \u201cChurch Bells\u201d won Female Video of the Year, bringing her total of CMT Music Awards to 17 over the show\u2019s history.\n\n\u201cThank you to all the people who came out to see us on tour and were a part of this video.
