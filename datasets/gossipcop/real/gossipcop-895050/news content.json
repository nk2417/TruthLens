When Mark Cuban announced that they had won the AMA for Favorite Alternative Rock Artist on Sunday, November 19, he thought that they weren\u2019t in attendance \u2014 until they made their way to the stage.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t know we were gonna be here you guys \u2026 but we\u2019re here,\u201d Linkin Park cofounder Mike Shinoda said while accepting the award, thanking nominees Imagine Dragons and twenty one pilots. He then added that members of both bands had reached out following the death of their lead singer, Chester Bennington. Bennington, who was open about his battle with depression, committed suicide on July 20.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Deaths in 2017 See all the celebrities that died in 2007, including Chris Cornell, Erin Moran and Greg Allman \u2014 read more\n\n\u201cWe want to dedicate this award to him, to his memory, to his talent, to his sense of humor, to his joy,\u201d Shinoda, 40, said alongside Brad Delson and Rob Bourdon. \u201cWhether you\u2019re a fan or an artist, take a moment to appreciate what you\u2019ve got and make Chester proud.\u201d\n\nFollowing his passing, the band posted a heartfelt message on their website. \u201cOur hearts are broken. The shockwaves of grief and denial are still sweeping through our family as we come to grips with what has happened,\u201d they wrote, addressing a letter to Chester. \u201cYou touched so many lives, maybe even more than you realized.\u201d\n\nIf you or anyone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 to be connected to a local
