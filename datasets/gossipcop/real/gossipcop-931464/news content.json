Here, we relive West's biggest OMG moments!\n\n\u201cFor whatever reason, Kanye felt the need to spend a full hour on TMZ Live today to defend his love for Donald Trump and to go off on a tangent not seen since the glory days of Gary Busey on Celebrity Rehab,\u201d he joked after showing a clip of the rapper\u2019s admission that he was addicted to opioids after having liposuction in 2016.\n\nWest, 40, recounted upping his dosage from two pills a day to seven following a stint in the hospital. The late-night host suggested, \u201cMaybe you should be taking eight.\u201d\n\nRelated: Kanye West\u2019s 13 Most Intriguing Quotes of All Time Kanye West has never shied away from speaking his mind. The iconic rapper has used his platform to share his thoughts on politics, music, religion and even his own legacy. \u201cI don\u2019t care about having a legacy, I don\u2019t care about being remembered,\u201d the Yeezy designer told Time magazine in April 2015. \u201cThe most important thing to [\u2026]\n\nThe Yeezy designer went on to compare TMZ to a hospital, at which point Kimmel said, \u201cKim, it\u2019s time to come get your husband.\u201d\n\nThe comedian, 50, tried to reason with West: \u201cHere\u2019s the thing, though \u2014 this job, doing this show every night is hard enough. Keeping up with the White House on a daily basis is exhausting. I can\u2019t handle Donald Trump and Kanye West at the same time. It\u2019s too much. It\u2019s like being a single mother with twins. I can\u2019t do it. One of you is gonna have to stop. I\u2019ll let you decide between yourselves which one it\u2019s gonna be.\u201d\n\nRelated: Kardashian-Jenner Family\u2019s Biggest Controversies and Scandals All the drama! Over the years, the Kardashian-Jenner family has made headlines for the ups and downs that occurred in their personal and professional lives.

For 400 years? That sounds like a choice,\u201d he said. \u201cLike, that was there for 400 years and it\u2019s all of y\u2019all? It\u2019s like, we\u2019re mentally in prison. I like the word \u2018prison\u2019 because slavery is too direct to the idea of blacks. Like Holocaust is Jews, slavery is blacks. So prison is something that unites us as one race, whites and blacks being one race. The human race.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cFamous\u201d rapper later clarified his thoughts in a Twitter rant. \u201cto make myself clear. Of course I know that slaves did not get shackled and put on a boat by free will,\u201d he tweeted Tuesday evening. \u201cMy point is for us to have stayed in that position even though the numbers were on our side means that we were mentally enslaved.

I will not allow my tongue to be cut.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
