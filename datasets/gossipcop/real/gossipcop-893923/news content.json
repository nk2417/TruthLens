With less than three weeks to go until the January 17 premiere, the show is digging a bit deeper into the mystery with a behind-the-scenes look explaining why this shocking murder is truly a perfect American crime to dissect 20 years later.\n\n\u201cThis particular manhunt is the largest failed FBI manhunt in history,\u201d actor Darren Criss tells us in the video. The failed manhunt centers around Criss\u2019 character, Andrew Cunanan, a hustler and grifter who landed in Miami after a killing spree that saw at least four closeted gay men dead throughout the Midwest. Cunanan\u2019s crimes were tangled with his fear of being outed and his use of his sexuality to control his victims by telling them he would out them to their families if they didn\u2019t go along with him.\n\nBefore heading to Florida, Cunanan was put on the FBI\u2019s most wanted list. When they didn\u2019t track him to the coastal city in time, Cunanan managed to kill fashion designer Versace on the steps of his Miami home. The killer eventually took his own life without ever being arrested.\n\nExecutive producer Nina Jacobson says that in choosing the crimes they dramatize for ACS, they want to explore how these issues affect all Americans, and not just those at the center of the crimes. In The Assassination of Gianni Versace, the show looks at gay culture and how Americans treated gay men, the AIDS epidemic, and more in the \u201990s, all culminating with Cunanan\u2019s killing spree.\n\n\u201cPeople were scared at the fact that this man was killing gay men,\u201d Ricky Martin, who plays Versace\u2019s partner Antonio D\u2019Amico, says in the clip. \u201cStill some people don\u2019t understand why it happened.\u201d Executive producer Brad Simpson agrees, saying, \u201cAndrew\u2019s journey is a journey through politics of homosexuality as they played across America in the 1990s.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is,\u201d Criss quips, \u201cfear and prejudice, unfortunately, is always in fashion.\u201d\n\nWill you watch this season of American Crime Story?
