She also clapped back at a fan who suggested Vanderpump isn\u2019t filming because her brother, Mark, died of a reported drug overdose in May. \u201cI too lost my father while filming and I completely understand that everyone\u2019s grieving process is just that their grieving process. We have all reached out to her and we are all there for her,\u201d she wrote. \u201cShe has chosen to not film with us. I too lost my sister to an overdose. I have great empathy and I have been there. If you sign up to do a job you do it. No matter what. That\u2019s show biz. I did it.\u201d\n\nRinna continued: \u201cEileen [Davidson] did it when her mother passed away the day before the reunion. You show up or if you can\u2019t then you say i can\u2019t and I\u2019m going to take this season off to heal. But please don\u2019t make any of us out to be bullies. We are not. We are all here to film a tv show that we all signed a contract to do it. We wish Lvp only the very best in her time mourning.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
