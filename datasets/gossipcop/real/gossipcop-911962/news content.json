He fled the country after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a minor.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t rape a 13-year-old,\u201d Tarantino said in the unearthed interview when asked by Stern why Hollywood embraces Polanski. \u201cIt was statutory rape. That\u2019s not quite the same thing. \u2026 He had sex with a minor. That\u2019s not rape. To me, when you use the word \u2018rape,\u2019 you\u2019re talking about violent, throwing them down; it\u2019s like one of the most violent crimes in the world. Throwing the word \u2018rape\u2019 around is like throwing the word \u2018racist\u2019 around. It doesn\u2019t apply to everything that people use it for. He was guilty of having sex with a minor.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cThe Howard Stern Show\u201d co-host Robin Quivers then interrupted the \u201cDjango Unchained\u201d director, as she did throughout the interview, to note that the sex wasn\u2019t consensual.\n\n\u201cNo, that was not the case at all. She wanted to have it and dated the guy,\u201d he said.\n\nQuivers cut him off again, exclaiming, \u201cShe was 13!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd by the way, we\u2019re talking about America\u2019s morals, we\u2019re not talking about the morals in Europe and everything,\u201d Tarantino said.\n\nStern then interjected.\n\n\u201cWait a minute. If you have sex with a 13-year-old girl and you\u2019re a grown man, you know that that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said.\n\nTarantino replied, \u201cLook, she was down with this. \u2026 She\u2019s talked about it since, \u2018No, he didn\u2019t really do anything to me. It was a technicality for being 13.'\u201d\n\nStern and Quivers, audibly shocked by his comments, continued to push back.\n\n\u201cWould you ever seduce a 13-year-old with pills and booze?\u201d Stern asked point blank.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no. Again, you\u2019re killing him with the pills and booze thing,\u201d the Oscar winner responded.\n\nWhen Quivers said Polanski could have avoided trouble by staying away from the 13-year-old, Tarantino said, \u201cHe likes girls.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe likes babies!\u201d Quivers countered.\n\nHe later admitted that he would \u201cbeat the hell out of him\u201d if the 13-year-old was his own daughter.\n\n\u201cBut the situation was not that she was against all this. She was down to party with Roman,\u201d he added.\n\nAudio of the interview was pulled from YouTube on Tuesday due to a copyright claim by Sirius XM.\n\nTarantino\u2019s rep did not respond to a request for comment.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/quentin-tarantino-defends-polanski.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/quentin-tarantino-defends-polanski.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maane Khatchatourian", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/quentin-tarantino-defends-roman-polanski-interview-1202688885/", "title": "Quentin Tarantino Defends Polanski in Resurfaced Interview: 13-Year-Old Girl \u2018Wanted to Have It\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Quentin Tarantino is under fire for defending Roman Polanski in a 2003 Howard Stern interview.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Maane Khatchatourian", "tags": "Howard Stern, Quentin Tarantino, Roman Polanski", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Quentin Tarantino Defends Polanski in Resurfaced Interview: 13-Year-Old Girl \u2018Wanted to Have It\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/quentin-tarantino-defends-roman-polanski-interview-1202688885/", "description": "Quentin Tarantino is under fire for defending Roman Polanski in a 2003 Howard Stern interview.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/quentin-tarantino-defends-polanski.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Quentin Tarantino Defends Polanski"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-06T16:49:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-06T19:06:21+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Quentin Tarantino is under fire for defending Roman Polanski in a 2003 Howard Stern interview.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@MaaneKhat", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Quentin Tarantino Defends Polanski in Resurfaced Interview: 13-Year-Old Girl \u2018Wanted to Have It\u2019", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/quentin-tarantino-defends-polanski.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517935768.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
