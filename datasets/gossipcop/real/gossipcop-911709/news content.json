During Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl, a moving clip aired for the Irwin family\u2019s new Animal Planet series, which featured Steve reflecting on his passion for wildlife conservation and his family\u2019s involvement.\n\nHis daughter Bindi shared the truly moving video of her late father to Twitter.\n\n\u201cMy first time watching this footage was only a few days ago,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to describe the amount of emotion in my heart once the video ended. My dad. My superhero. I promise to do my best to make you proud and ensure your legacy lives on forever.\u201d\n\nThe video features a visibly emotional Steve talking about his children, saying, \u201cIs there anything in this world that would want to make me give away what I\u2019m doing now? Yes, there is. When my children can take the football that I call wildlife conservation and run it up. When they\u2019re ready to run up our mission, I\u2019ll gladly step aside, and I guarantee you it will be the proudest moment of my life.\u201d\n\nChoking back tears, Steve continued, \u201cThen and only then will I know that I have achieved my ultimate goal, to be able to stand aside and let them run up my mission.\u201d\n\nFellow Aussie, Russell Crowe, also tweeted the footage, writing, \u201cAh, talk about a Super Bowl day moment\u2026 what a top bloke\u2026 tough as nails, heart on his sleeve, never a wasted breath, full of love and man could he make me laugh.\u201d\n\nBindi, who was only eight years old when her father died, and her younger brother, Robert, have indeed continued their father\u2019s work in wildlife conservation. They work with all kinds of animals at the Australia Zoo alongside their mother, Terri Irwin.\n\nBindi previously opened up on the Today show about how she honors the Crocodile Hunter star's memory, saying, \u201cWe do want to carry on in dad\u2019s footsteps, and make sure everything he worked so hard for continues on.\u201d\n\nThe family\u2019s series will premiere on the Animal Planet in the fall 2018. Steve\u2019s show, The Crocodile Hunter, aired on the Animal Planet from 1996 to 2007.\n\nFor more from the Irwins, watch the clip below!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-02/pink_willow_getty914303898.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-01/irwin_family.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-01/robert_irwin_gettyimages-693573876.jpg?h=a5d655c8&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/steve_irwin_bindi_irwin_robert_irwin_gettyimages-95488739.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-10/bindi_terri_robert_irwin_instagram.jpg?h=8fc73106&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/steve_irwin_bindi_irwin_robert_irwin_gettyimages-95488739.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/bindi-irwin-shares-emotional-video-of-late-steve-irwin-proving-just-how-proud-hed-be-of-his-kids", "title": "Bindi Irwin Shares Emotional Video of Late Steve Irwin, Proving Just How Proud He\u2019d Be of His Kids", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/steve_irwin_bindi_irwin_robert_irwin_gettyimages-95488739.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "In the clip, which aired during the Super Bowl, Steve talks about handing over his mission to his kids.", "title": "Bindi Irwin Shares Emotional Video of Late Steve Irwin, Proving Just How Proud He\u2019d Be of His Kids", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/bindi-irwin-shares-emotional-video-of-late-steve-irwin-proving-just-how-proud-hed-be-of-his-kids", "type": "Article"}, "description": "In the clip, which aired during the Super Bowl, Steve talks about handing over his mission to his kids.", "twitter": {"description": "In the clip, which aired during the Super Bowl, Steve talks about handing over his mission to his kids.", "title": "Bindi Irwin Shares Emotional Video of Late Steve Irwin, Proving Just How Proud He\u2019d Be of His Kids", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/bindi-irwin-shares-emotional-video-of-late-steve-irwin-proving-just-how-proud-hed-be-of-his-kids", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/steve_irwin_bindi_irwin_robert_irwin_gettyimages-95488739.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Bindi Irwin Shares Emotional Video of Late Steve Irwin, Proving Just How Proud He\u2019d Be of His Kids | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, TV, Super Bowl, Bindi Irwin", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
