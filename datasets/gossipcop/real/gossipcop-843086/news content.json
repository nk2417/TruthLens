I do not wear well with tricks designed to make me do what someone else decides I will do.\u201d\n\nShe ended by suggesting Aldrich \u201cre-cast and pay me off. It will be cheaper in the long run.\u201d\n\nThis maneuver explains how Davis found herself sitting at Aldrich\u2019s side throughout filming, why Aldrich obliged Davis\u2019s creative input, and how Davis secured the leverage to properly torture Crawford.\n\nAlthough certain moments in \u201cAbandoned\u201d feel exaggerated for dramatic effect\u2014like Crawford being made to wait for her hotel room, and then being stuck in a room next to the garbage disposal\u2014the episode\u2019s writers actually skimped on the insane details of what actually happened.\n\nFor example, according to Shaun Considine\u2019s Bette and Joan: The Divine Feud, Crawford arrived at the Baton Rouge airport with a full entourage\u2014including her hairdresser, makeup artist, and enough baggage to . . . well, let Davis explain:\n\n\u201cFor a goddamn week in Baton Rouge, she brought twenty pieces of luggage. It was a black-and-white movie but she had color-coordinated outfits for the daytime scenes, and for the night shots all of her evening dresses were chiffon, which meant that the wardrobe lady had to spend hours ironing them in the one-hundred-degree weather.\u201d\n\nWhen Crawford arrived to set the fourth day of filming, Davis had already tactically befriended the local press and crew\u2014the latter of whom she would eat lunch with. George Cukor later reflected on Davis\u2019s stone-cold set strategy: \u201cShe wanted to make a basket case out of Joan, and she almost succeeded.\u201d\n\nTo further chip away at Crawford\u2019s ego, Davis also coordinated group outings, cast and crew dinners, and other after-hours activities, inviting everyone except Joan. \u201cDavis [also] made sure that everyone, including members of the press and distinguished visitors to the set, knew that Joan was really 60 years old,\u201d authors Lawrence J. Quirk and William Schoell write in Joan Crawford: The Essential Biography, before revealing another Davis tactic. \u201cShe would also stand next to director Aldrich while he was filming Joan\u2019s scenes and make loud, negative comments.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6912302be09f2aa2f0d4b6ab/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined",
