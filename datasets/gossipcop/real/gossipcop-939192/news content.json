Hugh Grant emerged as a leading British actor with his breakthrough role in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" (1994), which earned him a Golden Globe and established his trademark persona of the charming, stammering English gentleman. This led to a string of successful romantic comedies, including \"Notting Hill\" (1999), \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" (2001), and \"Love Actually\" (2003).\n\nDespite being typecast in romantic roles, Grant demonstrated his versatility in films like \"About a Boy\" (2002) and \"Music and Lyrics\" (2007). In the 2010s, he successfully reinvented himself with more dramatic and character-driven roles, earning acclaim for his performance in \"Florence Foster Jenkins\" (2016) alongside Meryl Streep.\n\nHis career renaissance continued with darker, more complex roles in \"A Very English Scandal\" (2018), where he portrayed British politician Jeremy Thorpe, earning Emmy and Golden Globe nominations. He received further acclaim for \"The Undoing\" (2020) and \"Paddington 2\" (2017), where he brilliantly played against type as a villainous actor. Most recently, Grant has continued to challenge his public image with roles in \"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\" (2022) and \"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\" (2023), proving his enduring talent and adaptability.\n\nEarly Life\n\nHugh Grant was born in London on September 9, 1960. Grant graduated from New College in Oxford, where he studied English literature and acted purely for pleasure. He never thought of having a career in the entertainment industry. However, Grant soon performed in a touring production of \"Twelfth Night\" and started participating in the Oxford University Dramatic Society.\n\nCareer\n\nHis professional career started in the early 1980s with small roles in theater and television. His first notable film role came in \"Maurice\" (1987), where he played Clive Durham, earning the Volpi Cup at the Venice Film Festival alongside co-star James Wilby.\n\nThroughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, Grant appeared in various British films and television productions, including \"Rowing with the Wind\" (1988) and \"Impromptu\" (1991), where he portrayed Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. However, his life-changing breakthrough came with Richard Curtis's \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" (1994). His portrayal of the charming, self-deprecating Charles earned him a Golden Globe Award and BAFTA nomination, establishing him as a leading man and launching him to international stardom.\n\nThe mid-to-late 1990s saw Grant become one of Hollywood's biggest romantic comedy stars. He starred in \"Nine Months\" (1995), \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1995), and \"Mickey Blue Eyes\" (1999). His role opposite Julia Roberts in \"Notting Hill\" (1999) further cemented his status as a romantic leading man, grossing over $360 million worldwide.\n\nThe 2000s began with continued success in romantic comedies, including \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" (2001) and its sequel, where he played the deliciously caddish Daniel Cleaver. \"About a Boy\" (2002) showed his ability to bring depth to comedy, earning critical acclaim for his portrayal of a shallow man finding meaning through an unlikely friendship. \"Love Actually\" (2003) and \"Music and Lyrics\" (2007) continued his romantic comedy streak.\n\nHowever, the 2010s saw Grant deliberately move away from his traditional romantic lead roles, taking on more complex and darker characters. He received praise for his performance as multiple characters in \"Cloud Atlas\" (2012) and played a villainous actor in \"Paddington 2\" (2017), which he has claimed is his best film.\n\nHis career has experienced a remarkable renaissance in recent years with acclaimed performances in dramatic roles. He earned multiple award nominations for portraying Jeremy Thorpe in \"A Very English Scandal\" (2018), followed by another tour-de-force performance in \"The Undoing\" (2020) opposite Nicole Kidman. Recent projects like \"Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery\" (2022) and \"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves\" (2023) have shown his continued versatility and willingness to play against type.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nHugh has been linked to a number of beautiful women during his life, most notably Elizabeth Hurley. When they first started dating, Elizabeth was a minor television actress in England who was not widely known. In 1994, Hugh brought Elizabeth to the premiere of his movie \"Four Weddings and a Funeral.\" She wore a revealing black Versace dress that was held together with oversized gold safety pins. She was a superstar practically overnight. They would continue dating through 2000, even after his 1995 arrest with a prostitute in Los Angeles. Here is a photo from that 1994 movie premiere that made Elizabeth world-famous:\n\nHugh has a daughter and a son with a woman named Tinglan Hong. Hugh has three children with a Swedish TV producer named Anna Eberstein. He has five children in total as of this writing. Hugh and Anna made it official with a wedding in May 2018.\n\nNotable Salaries\n\nHugh earned $100,0000 for his role in 1994's \"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\" which launched his career. By the late 1990s he was commanding $7-10 million per film. He made $12.5 million for 2002's \"Two Weeks Notice\". Hugh typically earns $10 million for a starring role today or $5 million for a smaller supporting role.\n\nReal Estate\n\nOver the years, Hugh has developed a large real estate portfolio that, at times, has numbered dozens of homes. In 2000, he spent $3 million on a mansion in London's affluent Chelsea neighborhood. In 2011, he spent $3 million on a nearby mansion for his former girlfriend, Tinglan Hong, and their two children.\n\nIn 2006 he spent $20 million for a six-bedroom mansion in Chelsea Square. He sold this home three years later for $32 million.\n\nIn 2016, Hugh bought a home for himself and Anna Eberstein for $13 million. They also own a $700,000 resort property in her home country of Sweden.\n\nIn 2019, the married couple spent $23 million on a home in Chelsea. They still own the home that was purchased in 2016. They reportedly rent it out for $10,000 per month.", "images": ["https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/1JoH3482haSLevnlEMdqhrz36y0=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/11/George-Clooney.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/I4dSiTJhq0kprSuO--deoPCEAmQ=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/06/taylor.png", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/uRsxoLs7Ymmit5ATgRtN2utad40=/221x5:381x236/132x132/filters:format(webp):strip_exif()/2009/09/P-Diddy.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/KNDSqD-9inbRekV6AGgXDEG2Scw=/375x35:810x586/132x132/filters:format(webp):strip_exif()/2015/09/GettyImages-476575299.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/themes/cnw_2023/svg/logo.svg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/Vq2Fn7FvO6AFB_o_WTHiuFkgfIE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/09/rz.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/0dOqT2nlNQM7u_J-5xWrCsf2nAw=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/02/Angelina-Jolie.png", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/_hOmdPz8Ht24ZxIeZM7m4mGRouk=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/11/GettyImages-1094653148.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/_SVm85rIcgbVe6LTrrJZ9o6D6BE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2014/08/GettyImages-518040218.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Hugh-Grant.jpg?x46379", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/Y14fttV9jls9mxFLuNAHJTnNWTE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/10/denzel-washington-1.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/IoWqGPmFDjvC6iTqcDsspXBuxqo=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2018/03/GettyImages-821622848.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/-7Xn3ufWieA5a0UdYm33AfFT-ck=/600x300/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/11/Hugh-Grant.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/EbX6oYOgZ-m3bJgmlZA3PkBXMNI=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2014/08/Richard-Curtis.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/dXuAPIEBU--L_kRib4u0nSzjUtE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/04/Megan-Fox.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/v5QAjVwX95wzf97OKkFgjpfFoCE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2010/02/GettyImages-107940322.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/Mf5yCglsJX972KhpRPR3SiVopxk=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2011/09/Simon-Helberg-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/lY3-oCS-xIdiqDaOi1qHd6UaTjg=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/09/Cristiano-Ronaldo.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/UxnQSql1h0QyX1CgkPqKhTxCTHM=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/09/Jennifer-Aniston.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript"], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Hugh-Grant.jpg?x46379", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/hugh-grant-net-worth/", "title": "Hugh Grant Net Worth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Hugh Grant net worth and salary: Hugh Grant is a British actor and producer who has a net worth of $150 million.
