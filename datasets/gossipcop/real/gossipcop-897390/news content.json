music to executive producing a hit Netflix series, to her health struggles and continued Instagram fame \u2014 and Billboard honored her with \u201cWoman of the Year\u201d award at the 2017 Billboard Women in Music event.\n\nExplore Selena Gomez See latest videos, charts and news\n\nCo-star Elle Fanning introduced Gomez at the ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s rare to find someone who uses their trials and tribulations to make everyone else stronger.\u201d\n\nFrancia Raisa \u2014 the actress who donated her kidney to Gomez \u2014 presented her with the honor.\n\n\u201cWhen we first met, we bonded immediately,\u201d Raisa explained.\n\n\u201cWhen I found out I was a match for Selena, I didn\u2019t think twice about it,\u201d she said of her kidney donation.\n\nGomez almost immediately teared up after accepting the award from Raisa, saying she saved her life.\n\n\u201cI feel incredibly lucky,\u201d Gomez began. \u201cHonestly, I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for the position I\u2019ve been given in my career.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want people to know I respect the platform that I have so deeply,\u201d Gomez said.\n\n\u201cSpecifically this year, I would like to thank my amazing team and my family because they stuck with me through some really hard times,\u201d Gomez continued. \u201cI got to do a lot this year, even though I had a couple of other things to do.\u201d\n\nShe then paid tribute to those who had come before her. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for the older women who have lifted all of us up.\u201d\n\nAfter thanking Fanning and Raisa, Gomez added \u201cI don\u2019t know how I\u2019ll ever repay it but maybe I\u2019ll make an epic album next year.\u201d", "images":
