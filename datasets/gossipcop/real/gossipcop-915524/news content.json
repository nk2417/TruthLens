Benoit Beaus\u00e9jour-Savard popped the question (in French!) and proposed with a blinding Neil Lane engagement ring during the World Tells All special. So how did the gorgeous oval-shaped diamond come to be? The jeweler opened up to PEOPLE all about the entire design process.\n\nAs the go-to designer for Bachelor Nation proposals, Lane typically spends time with the fianc\u00e9-to-be to create a ring perfectly suited for the couple. But this time the process was a bit different.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever designed a ring for a couple I haven\u2019t met in person,\u201d Lane tells PEOPLE. \u201cI remember Clare from a few years back and knew a little about her but knew nothing about the couple. The groom and I usually get to spend a lot of time together. This time, we essentially had to design the ring via telepathy! We traded calls and text messages to create the perfect ring, a true expression of his love for her.\u201d\n\nNeil Lane\n\nBut there were a few things lost in translation while consulting via text message. \u201cI had to work that much harder to draw from our conversations, the essence of Benoit and Clare\u2019s connection,\u201d Lane says. \u201cIn the beginning, Benoit asked me for a \u2018race track\u2019 or \u2018football stadium\u2019-shaped diamond. It took me a moment to realize he was talking about an oval cut!\u201d\n\nLane ended up designing and delivering the ring in less than two weeks, and he says creating rings for The Bachelor for 10 years has \u201cprepared me for anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Winter Games is a completely new part of the franchise and proved to be a fun and challenging way to test my mettle,\u201d Lane says. \u201cHow quick, creative, and adaptable can I be?\u201d\n\nAnd once, again he designed a ring the couple was very happy with. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have the one I was looking for, so he built a custom one, which is amazing,\u201d Beaus\u00e9jour-Savard said. \u201cIt was exactly what I asked, and he did the best job ever. It blows my mind. It was the first time that I had to shop for this, and it will be the last one for sure. It\u2019s kind of stressful, but I\u2019m glad she likes it.\u201d\n\nNeil Lane\n\nOn the show, Crawley ended up breaking things off with Beaus\u00e9jour-Savard to get to know German contestant Christian Rauch better. After things didn\u2019t work out with Rauch and Crawley left Winter Games, Beaus\u00e9jour-Savard reconnected with Crawley with a text asking how she was doing after leaving the show.\n\nBachelor Winter Games\u2019 Clare Crawley and Benoit Are Engaged!\n\nThings progressed (away from the cameras) from that text eventually to Beaus\u00e9jour-Savard\u2019s surprise proposal during the World Tell All special. \u201cIt\u2019s overwhelming, it\u2019s crazy,\u201d Crawley told PEOPLE. \u201cGoing on these Bachelor shows is a huge risk and you don\u2019t know the outcome. It\u2019s scary, but it\u2019s a risk that you have to take to get the good in the end.\u201d\n\nBeaus\u00e9jour-Savard also didn\u2019t anticipate such a whirlwind end to the Games. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this,\u201d he told PEOPLE. \u201cI was heartbroken on The Bachelorette: Canada but going back on this show I had an open mind. I was realistic that there might not be someone for me. But like you\u2019ve seen on TV, I had the biggest crush ever on her. [But then] it wasn\u2019t a crush, it was developing into something really deep and strong.\u201d", "images":
