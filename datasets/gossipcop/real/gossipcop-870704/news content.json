News , admitting that the incident caused \u201ca little tear\u201d to roll her cheek.\n\nHowever, Murgatroyd kept cool and composed and explained to the site that she calmly told her firstborn, who she and her husband welcomed into the world on January 4, that \u201cmama\u2019s hurt.\u201d\n\nBut grabbing chunks of his mom\u2019s hair isn\u2019t the only way little Shai has been expressing himself. Peta revealed that the youngster is also asserting himself when it comes to his food habits.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll grab the food bowl [and] throw it wherever he can,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s very cheeky right now.\u201d\n\nMurgatroyd\u2019s latest confessions about her and Chmerkovskiy\u2019s bundle of joy comes shortly after she revealed that he\u2019s already getting very strong and pulling himself up, while the youngster is also starting to get two teeth coming through .\n\n\u201cWe have some nights of screaming at the moment with the pain,\u201d the Dancing with the Stars professional told Extra of how she\u2019s having sleepless nights with her baby as he starts teething. \u201cYou just get up as soon as you hear anything\u2026 mommy mode just kicks in and you just get straight up.\u201d\n\nBut while it sounds like Shai certainly isn\u2019t afraid to express himself, Maksim revealed last week that he could soon be taking all that feistiness and channeling it into dancing just like his parents.\n\nChmerkovskiy shared a video of his son getting his very first dance lesson from his brother Val Chmerkovskiy, who also appears on Dancing with the Stars alongside Maksim and Peta, to Instagram.\n\nThe adorable video, which has since gone viral, shows the brothers spending some quality time with little Shai as Maks holds him in his arms while Val wiggled his hands to make him dance.\n\nThe youngster could be seen grooving and giggling while enjoying a dance break with his dad and his uncle while Maksim joked in the caption that his son has most definitely inherited his parents dancing genes.\n\n\u201cDNA. Something about some fruit and some trees,\u201d he captioned the sweet clip.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BXG_SGHH57Q/\n\nAs for what\u2019s next for Peta and Maksim, Murgatroyd admitted earlier this week that there\u2019s a chance she and her husband may not head back into the ballroom for Dancing with the Stars Season 25 this coming September.\n\nShe revealed that the two haven\u2019t yet signed on the dotted line for the new round of shows next month and may instead take the season off to spend more time with their son.\n\nWhat do you think of Peta Murgatroyd revelations about her and Maksim Chmerkovskiy\u2019s 7-month-old son?\n\n[Featured Image by Monica Schipper/Getty Images]", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2421769f-57a4-4bff-913f-cf316747493e.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20157'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/673ddaf526e964d15376329334d8a5b2?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20492%20142'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo-white.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent-Dark-Mode.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20120%20120'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/dwts-peta-murgatroyd-maksim-chmerkovskiy-son-shai-pulled-hair-out", "title": "\u2018DWTS\u2019 Star Peta Murgatroyd Says Her & Maksim Chmerkovskiy\u2019s Son Pulled Her Hair Out", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.png", "description": "Peta Murgatroyd is revealing the naughty thing her and husband Maksim Chmerkovskiy\u2019s 7-month-old son did that left her in tears.", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018DWTS\u2019 Star Peta Murgatroyd Says Her & Maksim Chmerkovskiy\u2019s Son Pulled Her Hair Out - Inquisitr News", "description": "Peta Murgatroyd is revealing the naughty thing her and husband Maksim Chmerkovskiy\u2019s 7-month-old son did that left her in tears.", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/dwts-peta-murgatroyd-maksim-chmerkovskiy-son-shai-pulled-hair-out", "site_name": "Inquisitr News"}, "article": {"tag": "Val Chmerkovskiy", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-08-05T05:59:00-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018DWTS\u2019 Star Peta Murgatroyd Says Her & Maksim Chmerkovskiy\u2019s Son Pulled Her Hair Out - Inquisitr News", "description": "Peta Murgatroyd is revealing the naughty thing her and husband Maksim Chmerkovskiy\u2019s 7-month-old son did that left her in tears.", "site": "@theinquisitr", "creator": "@theinquisitr"}, "generator": "WP Rocket 3.18.3"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501927140.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
