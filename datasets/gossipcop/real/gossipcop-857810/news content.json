Even if we didn\u2019t get pregnant,\u201d Bookout admitted to Portwood and Baltierra.\n\nWhen Baltierra asked how Ryan was doing, Bookout admitted, \u201cHe\u2019s okay,\u201d\n\n\u201cRyan\u2019s f\u2014ed up,\u201d Portwood chimed in. \u201cI watch it, I see it, I know it,\u201d she continued as Bookout shook her head in agreement.\n\nMTV Communications\n\nPortwood continued: \u201cWhere he\u2019s at right now, when I see him, I know where he\u2019s at and I\u2019m like, \u2018Wow, he needs some guidance.\u2019 \u201d\n\nUpon Baltierra questioning whether anyone close to Ryan has \u201ctalked to him about going to a treatment center,\u201d Bookout admitted that, \u201c[Ryan] would do it. It\u2019s everyone else around him that\u2019s too afraid to admit it.\u201d\n\nWhen Portwood suggested that Ryan have somebody that he can turn to, Bookout revealed that \u201che\u2019s got me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that everyone else around him is too afraid of what it will look like more than his health,\u201d said Bookout, who confirmed to Baltierra that everyone is in denial about his battle. \u201cAbsolutely, it\u2019s all denial. They all know.\u201d\n\nMTV Communications\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Teen Mom OG\u2019s Maci Bookout and Taylor McKinney Have Tied the Knot!\n\n\u201cHonestly, the hardest thing is for me to see Ryan not love himself because he is a person worth loving. He deserves to love himself,\u201d Bookout explained.\n\nPortwood added, \u201cPeople forget that. You are so in love with the drugs that you feel that if you wake up in the morning without them you want to die. So, should I die? It\u2019s a feeling that you can never f\u2014ing feel unless you\u2019ve really been to the bottom. He needs to find where his bottom may be.\u201d\n\nWhile reflecting on Ryan\u2019s struggles, Bookout broke down in tears and revealed the fears that she has about her ex, including him dying.\n\nMTV Communications\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just sick of cleaning up his mess,\u201d an emotional Bookout said. \u201cI get tired of dealing with the s\u2014. Just being the only one that f\u2014ing sees everything and cares,\u201d she said wiping away tears.\n\n\u201cI talk to Taylor about it like, \u2018I wonder if today\u2019s going to be the day that Ryan does something that he can\u2019t come back from?\u2019 \u201d she continued.\n\nLater that same day, Bookout and her husband, Taylor McKinney, enjoyed a sunset stroll on the beach, where she opened up to him about her chat with the Teen Mom OG stars.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I needed was two people that have been there on both sides of it that have my back no matter what,\u201d said Bookout. \u201cThey were genuinely just there for me.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Bachelorette Jillian Harris Talks Mom Shaming and Mom Guilt: \u201cWe\u2019re all so hard on ourselves\u201d\n\nWhen McKinney asked if Portwood and Baltierra had any advice for his wife, she responded, \u201cYeah they did: to do it. Stop being scared.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just going to be like, \u2018You have to go to rehab,\u2019 \u201d she said about what she plans to tell Ryan, who is engaged to his girlfriend, Mackenzie.\n\n\u201cRight now is legitimately about saving his life,\u201d she continued. \u201cMost nights I\u2019m crying in our bed talking to you about whether or not today is the day that he\u2019s going to die or when I\u2019m going to do something about it or how I should do something about it. And you\u2019ve always just been there for me. Thank you for being there for me and for not making me feel like that\u2019s not what I should be doing. I appreciate it.\u201d\n\nTeen Mom OG airs Mondays (9 p.m. ET) on MTV.", "images":
