The vehicle she was riding flipped over into a pond on Watson and Spears\u2019 Kentwood, Louisiana, property, and Maddie was subsequently submerged under water for several minutes.\n\nHelp arrived quickly and freed the little girl from the seat belt and safety netting after Spears, Watson and others could not. Maddie woke up, and was able to return home from the hospital five days later.\n\nFamily members, including aunt Britney asked for prayers over social media and elsewhere following the incident \u2014 and Maddie was eventually able to make a full recovery, celebrating her birthday in style four months later alongside some very special guests.\n\n\u201cMy baby is 9 years old today, and more then ever we realize how precious every day is. So, we have to thank these 2 HEROS \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb John and Victoria are the first responders, who literally saved Maddie\u2019s life, and they were able to celebrate her another year of her life with us this past weekend!\u201d she captioned a June photo of the two with the birthday girl.\n\nFROM PEN: Katherine Heigl Reveals the Emotional Way She Told Her Daughters She Was Pregnant\n\n\n\nRELATED GALLERY: Kylie Jenner and More Celebs Who Became Moms at a Young Age\n\nThe star opened up to Entertainment Tonight in 2016 about the potential of adding to her family, saying if it was up to Watson, they would \u201chave kids, like yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut for me, I think that having children is about timing, as well. I know that they always say, \u2018There is no right time to have a child, you know. Just have babies,\u2019 \u201d Spears said.\n\n\u201cBut I think right now that it\u2019s maybe a little selfish for me to have a child. I am getting busy,\u201d she continued. \u201cI want to be able to do the same as what I have done with Maddie \u2014 really just be a mom for a little bit and have that time to focus on my next child. But, yeah, we want more babies, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to have kids since the day we got married,\u201d said Watson, 35, adding that he and his wife would like to have \u201ca bunch\u201d of children and noting with a smile, \u201cThe time is right. It\u2019s always something with her career [and] I\u2019m really busy, too. There\u2019s no good time to have a kid.\u201d", "images":
