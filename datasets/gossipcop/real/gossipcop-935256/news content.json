Rob Kardashian showed ex-girlfriend Rita Ora, who he infamously bashed in 2013, some support after the singer faced backlash over controversial lyrics in her new song \u201cGirls.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Friendly Exes: Hollywood\u2019s Ex-Lovers Who Have Stayed Close Love lost doesn't mean friendship lost for these friendly exes! Take a look at ex-lovers such as Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake, Hilary Duff and Mike Comrie, and Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon, who have maintained close relationships even after splitting up.\n\nOra, 27, released the new single \u2014 featuring Cardi B, Bebe Rexha and Charli XCX \u2014 on Friday, May 11, and was criticized by fans for several lyrics, including \u201cSometimes I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls / Red wine, I just wanna kiss girls, girls, girls\u2026\u201d and \u201cI am excited, I\u2019m open-minded / I\u2019m 50/50, and I\u2019m never gonna hide it.\u201d Singer Hayley Kiyoko also blasted the song in a lengthy Instagram post where she said that the message the \u201ctone-deaf\u201d song sends is \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201cfuels the male gaze while marginalizing the idea of women loving women.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cHow We Do (Party)\u201d singer issued an apology for the song on Monday, May 14, which Kardashian retweeted alongside praising hands emojis a day later. Ora\u2019s mea culpa, which stated the song was \u201cwritten to represent my truth,\u201d apologized to those who found the song offensive, while serving as an admittance that she had \u201cromantic relationships with women and men.\u201d\n\nRelated: Rob Kardashian\u2019s Girlfriends Through the Years Click through to relive all of Rob Kardashian\u2019s relationships and flings throughout the years\n\nKardashian\u2019s choice to back up the \u201cRadioactive\u201d singer was not lost on those who have spent the last decade keeping up with the Kardashians. In 2013, the Arthur George designer, who admitted he gained \u201c40 pounds\u201d while dating Ora in 2012, went on a social media tirade against the British pop star and accused her of cheating on him with \u201cnearly 20 dudes.\u201d The incident played out on an episode of Kourtney & Kim Take Miami, where his sisters tried to reason with him about why blasting her on the internet was inappropriate. The reality TV personality later revealed he bashed Ora online in an attempt to stop him from taking her back, saying, \u201cI just had to do that to make her hate me.\u201d\n\nRelated: When Exes Attack!

While appearing on Watch What Happens Live in February 2017, Ora told Andy Cohen she had \u201conly positive vibes\u201d for Kardashian.", "images":
