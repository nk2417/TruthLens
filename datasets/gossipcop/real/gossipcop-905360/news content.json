Even though her big win was in the spotlight, the actress was faced with probing questions about working with Woody Allen.\n\nAllen, who, for years, has been accused numerous times of sexual misconduct, directed Gerwig in the 2012 film To Rome With Love. In an interview with the New York Times, Gerwig addressed working with Allen and the allegations surrounding him.\n\n\u201cIt is something that I take very seriously and have been thinking deeply about, and it has taken me time to gather my thoughts and say what I mean to say,\u201d she said. \u201cI can only speak for myself and what I\u2019ve come to is this: If I had known then what I know now, I would not have acted in the film.\u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cI have not worked for him again, and I will not work for him again.\u201d\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nAfter Dylan Farrow\u2019s New York Times articles where she opened up about her accusations against Allen, Gerwig realized that she \u201cincreased another woman\u2019s pain.\u201d She continued \u201cI was heartbroken by that realization.
