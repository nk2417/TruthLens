While fans are already mourning the end of the popular Fox comedy series, star Zooey Deschanel said filming the end of the show was not a sad occasion.\n\n\u201cIt felt like we were ready for it to be the end, in a bittersweet way,\u201d Deschanel told Variety. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t difficult. It was like finishing a marathon, like we did this really long run for seven years and we\u2019ve played these characters a long time. It\u2019s not like there was any unfinished business. It felt like the right time to be ending it in the best way. I\u2019m sad not to see my friends that I\u2019ve worked with every day for so long, but it was all really positive in the end.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really wanted to do another season just so that we could send the show off properly,\u201d she continued. \u201cI appreciated that opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe seventh season picks up three years after the Season 6 finale. Jess and Nick are together and returning from a European book tour for Nick\u2019s latest novel. Stay-at-home dad Schmidt and working mom Cece are raising their daughter, Ruth, and Winston and Aly are married, with a child on the way.\n\nThe series has had no shortage of memorable \u2014 and hilarious \u2014 moments. Deschanel was hard-pressed to pick just one favorite, however.\n\n\u201cWhen we had Prince on, that was pretty amazing,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a really fun moment with Josh Gad making up a musical. When Justin Long was, like, tripping over couches and doing all his Justin Long stuff. The Nick and Jess kiss that was so unexpected and interesting. So many True American moments. All my Cece and Jess episodes were so fun. There are so many moments that I will cherish.\u201d\n\nAnd given the recent trend of reboots and revivals of popular shows, what would Deschanel like to see happen if the cast reunited ten years from now?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, because it really is so much about single people. In ten years, you would hope that people have sort of figured it out,\u201d she joked.\n\n\u201cNew Girl\u201d Season 7 kicks off on Fox Tuesday night at 9:30 p.m.\n\nPOPULAR VIDEO ON VARIETY", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/new-girl-season-7.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/new-girl-season-7.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Otterson", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/new-girl-season-7-zooey-deschanel-1202747963/", "title": "\u2018New Girl\u2019 Star Zooey Deschanel on Filming Series\u2019 Ending: \u2018We Were Ready\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"New Girl\" star Zooey Deschanel said filming the end of the series was not a sad occasion.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Joe Otterson", "tags": "Fox, New Girl, Zooey Deschanel", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018New Girl\u2019 Star Zooey Deschanel on Filming Series\u2019 Ending: \u2018We Were Ready\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/new-girl-season-7-zooey-deschanel-1202747963/", "description": "\"New Girl\" star Zooey Deschanel said filming the end of the series was not a sad occasion.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/new-girl-season-7.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "New Girl Season 7"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-10T15:15:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-10T15:15:07+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"New Girl\" star Zooey Deschanel said filming the end of the series was not a sad occasion.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@joeotterson", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018New Girl\u2019 Star Zooey Deschanel on Filming Series\u2019 Ending: \u2018We Were Ready\u2019", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/new-girl-season-7.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523373304.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
