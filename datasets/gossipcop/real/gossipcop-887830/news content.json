While delicious, those lattes aren't quite as eye-catching as the Unicorn Frappe, the neon concoction of the spring.\n\nNever fear, Starbs isn't letting a season go by without giving you something to 'gram. Halloween's creepiest drink, the Vampire Frappuccino, is officially back in at least four countries. Sadly, the bloody-looking treat hasn't been spotted in the U.S. yet, but the U.K., Singapore, Norway and Sweden all have it in stores, E! Online reports.\n\nIn case you need a refresher, the drink starts with mocha sauce, then layers a mocha frappe with strawberry puree to create a blood effect. Most also have whipped cream and more \"blood\" drizzled on top.\n\nSingapore's stores are offering two slightly different versions this year: Mr. and Mrs. Vampire Frappuccino. The Mr. version has chocolatey cereal layered on top, while the Mrs. has a pump of vanilla syrup added.\n\nFor the first time ever, Mr and Mrs #VampireFrappuccino makes a special daytime appearance. \ud83c\udf83 Click link in bio for more info.

Last year, American Starbucks' locations brought back the Frappula a few days before Halloween, but only for a few days. And since the ingredients are available year round, you can technically order it any time you want. Just ask nicely, or the barista's fangs might come out.", "images": ["https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://i.insider.com/589b629edd0895bf548b4a32?width=150&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/59e8d6a224e30a4c008b46a0?width=700", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "https://i.insider.com/59e8d69149e1cf39008b469c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/59e8d69149e1cf39008b469c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-vampire-frappuccinos-halloween-2017-10", "title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "datePublished": "2017-10-19T17:12:42.000Z", "dateModified": "2017-10-19T17:12:46.000Z", "news_keywords": "Food, Food, Starbucks, Halloween, Dessert", "description": "Starbucks fans now have something to look forward to this Halloween with the release of Vampire Frappuccinos.", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "tbi-vertical": "Food", "og": {"title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "description": "Starbucks fans now have something to look forward to this Halloween with the release of Vampire Frappuccinos.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/starbucks-vampire-frappuccinos-halloween-2017-10", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/59e8d69149e1cf39008b469c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "noindex", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"psvp": "c"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "59e8d70a2f2d9241008b46b8", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"sections": "Food", "tags": "Page Type:story"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2025-05", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.thisisinsider.com", "summary": ""}
