Kelly Ripa has been part of the network for nearly three decades.\n\nPhoto credit: ABC Kelly Ripa has been a part of the ABC morning talk show block for 15 years, replacing Kathie Lee Gifford as Regis Philbin\u2018s co-host on \u201cLive!\u201d in February 2001.\n\nPhoto credit: Getty Images After Philbin ended his 28-year run on the show, former NFL star Michael Strahan was picked to join Ripa on \u201cLive!\u201d in September 2012.\n\nPhoto credit: ABC In their nearly four-year run together, Michael & Kelly raised the show\u2019s ratings by 8 percent compared to the last four seasons of \u201cLive With Regis and Kelly.\u201d\n\nPhoto credit: ABC On April 19, it was revealed without Ripa\u2019s prior knowledge that Strahan would leave \u201cLive!\u201d this summer to join \u201cGood Morning America\u201d as co-anchor. Strahan had been appearing on \u201cGMA\u201d twice a week since 2014.\n\nPhoto credit: Getty Images A source told TheWrap there had been friction between Ripa and the rest of the \u201cLive!\u201d team. \u201cKelly has been very moody and emotional the past couple of years and Strahan was dreading going to work,\u201d the source said.\n\nPhoto credit: ABC Strahan formally announced his departure from \u201cLive!\u201d on air April 20, but Ripa did not host the episode. A spokesperson for the show did not elaborate on the reasons for Ripa\u2019s no-show.\n\nPhoto credit: Getty Images Over the weekend, Ripa reportedly spoke with Strahan and ABC president Ben Sherwood, who apologized for not telling Ripa about the \u201cGMA\u201d move sooner.\n\nPhoto credit: ABC On April 26, Ripa returned to \u201cLive!\u201d for the first time since Strahan\u2019s announcement and thanked the show\u2019s fans for their support. \u201cOur national nightmare is over,\u201d she joked.\n\nPhoto credit: ABC ABC also announced that Strahan\u2019s final \u201cLive!\u201d episode would be moved up from September to May to take advantage of \u201csweeps\u201d week.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/kelly-michael.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kelly-Ripa.png?resize=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/5x4_082025_COVER_B.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/rump-30-2.jpg?fit=300%2C169&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/strahangma.jpg?resize=618%2C413&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/good-morning-america.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/michael-strahan-140728.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeremy-Fuster.png?fit=53%2C58&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/michael-strahan-leaving-live-kelly-ripa-controversy.jpg?resize=620%2C420&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kelly-Ripa-1.png?resize=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/kelly-and-michael-farewell.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/ben-sherwood-president-abc-news-gettyimages.jpg?resize=618%2C411&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeremy-Fuster.png?resize=150%2C150&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Michael-Strahan-Kelly-Ripa.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/regis-and-kelly.jpg?resize=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Michael-Strahan-Kelly-Ripa.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Michael-Strahan-Kelly-Ripa.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeremy Fuster", "Film Reporter", "Joined Thewrap In", "Covers Box Office", "Labor News.
