His great uncle was priest and peace activist Bruce Kent.[5]\n\nAlwyn was privately educated at the City of London School.[2] He briefly took guitar lessons, and was part of a school band called Anger Management. He later played football and rugby at school.[6] Although an \"introverted\" child,[7] Alwyn knew he wanted to be an actor.[8] He auditioned for a small role in Love Actually, but was not cast.[4] In his late teens, he joined the National Youth Theatre.[9] While studying for a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in English literature and drama at the University of Bristol,[7] he acted in two student productions at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.[10] After graduating in 2012, he applied to four drama schools, and was accepted by the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama,[11] where he completed a BA degree in acting.[9] In his third year there, Alwyn signed with an agent who had seen him in a student showcase, and who then helped him get cast in the role of the title character in Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk (2016): his debut in a feature film.[6]\n\nCareer\n\nActing\n\nIn early 2015,[12][13] Alwyn was cast in the lead role of Taiwanese director Ang Lee's 2016 war drama film, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,[14][15] which is a film adaptation of the 2012 novel of the same name by American writer Ben Fountain.[16] Lee stated that he selected Alwyn because of his \"ability to communicate the book's paradox of war with just his facial expressions\".[17] Alwyn came to the United States for the first time after passing the film's auditions. He stated that he didn't \"exactly fit\" the casting requirements of the role, which were \"a 19-year-old U.S. Army grunt\"; Alwyn said he had long blond hair and was \"a lot skinnier\" when he auditioned.[18] In reviews of the film, critics praised Alwyn's performance for its naturalism.[11] Journalists went on to describe the film as his \"breakout\".[19][13] He then played a supporting role in the 2017 mystery drama film The Sense of an Ending, directed by Indian filmmaker Ritesh Batra.[19]\n\nAlwyn in August 2018\n\nAlwyn appeared in a number of 2018 films.

Alwyn stated that \"it came about from messing around on a piano, and singing badly,\" and then \"being overheard by Swift, and being, like, 'Let's see what happens if we get to the end of it together'\".[45] He is credited as co-producer of the songs \"Exile\", \"Betty\", \"My Tears Ricochet\", \"August\", \"This Is Me Trying\" and \"Illicit Affairs\" on Swift's eighth studio album, Folklore (2020);[46] and was also co-writer of \"Exile\" and \"Betty\", under the pseudonym William Bowery.[47] \"Exile\" reached the top 10 of the charts in various countries, including number six on the US Billboard Hot 100[48] and number eight on the UK Singles Chart.[49]\n\nAt the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2021, Folklore won the Album of the Year, earning Alwyn his first Grammy Award for his producing credit on the record.[50] Credited as Bowery, Alwyn also co-wrote \"Champagne Problems\", \"Coney Island\" and the title track on Swift's second 2020 album, Evermore.[51] In April 2022, Alwyn revealed to The Wall Street Journal that the name \"William Bowery\" was derived from the first name of his great-grandfather William Alwyn, who was a music composer, and the last name in honour of the New York City neighbourhood Bowery, where he had spent \"a lot of time\" when he first arrived in the U.S.[6] On Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights (2022), he is credited as co-writer of \"Sweet Nothing\", again as Bowery.[52]\n\nPersonal life\n\nAlwyn was in a relationship with Taylor Swift from 2016 to 2023.[53][note 2] It was subject to intense tabloid scrutiny.[57] On their breakup and the publicity surrounding it, Alwyn said in 2024: \"I would hope that anyone and everyone can empathize and understand the difficulties that come with the end of a long, loving, fully committed relationship of over six and a half years. That is a hard thing to navigate. What is unusual and abnormal in this situation is that, one week later, it's suddenly in the public domain and the outside world is able to weigh in ... There is always going to be a gap between what is known and what is said. I have made my peace with that.\"[58]\n\nAlwyn keeps his personal life private, which he described as a \"knee-jerk response to the culture we live in\".[6][59] GQ labelled Alwyn a \"notoriously low-key actor\".[60]\n\nAdvocacy\n\nSince the outbreak of the 2023 Gaza war, Alwyn has used his platform, particularly on Instagram, to raise awareness for the Palestinian cause and support charities, including Disaster Emergency Committee (DEC).[61] He signed the Artists4Ceasefire letter addressed to then U.S. President Joe Biden and sported the collective's pin at various public events.[62][63] Alwyn was one of the initial signatories of the Film Workers for Palestine boycott pledge, that was published in September 2025, pledging not to work with Israeli film institutions \"that are implicated in genocide and apartheid against the Palestinian people.[64]\n\nIn response to the April 2025 Supreme Court ruling on the definition of woman in the Equality Act and subsequent EHRC guidance, Alwyn was one of over 400 film and television professionals to sign an open letter pledging \"solidarity with the trans, non-binary and intersex communities\" and condemning both actions.[65]\n\nWork\n\nFilm\n\nKey \u2020 Denotes works that have not yet been released\n\nTelevision\n\nTheatre\n\nDiscography\n\nAccolades", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/94/Symbol_support_vote.svg/20px-Symbol_support_vote.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Joe_Alwyn_during_an_interview%2C_August_2018.png/250px-Joe_Alwyn_during_an_interview%2C_August_2018.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Joseph_Alwyn.jpg/960px-Joseph_Alwyn.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/20px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Joseph_Alwyn.jpg/250px-Joseph_Alwyn.jpg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Joseph_Alwyn.jpg/960px-Joseph_Alwyn.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Alwyn", "title": "Joe Alwyn", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bc/Joseph_Alwyn.jpg/960px-Joseph_Alwyn.jpg", "width": 831, "height": 1200}, "title": "Joe Alwyn - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
