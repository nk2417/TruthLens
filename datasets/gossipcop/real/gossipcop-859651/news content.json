Tim McGraw and Faith Hill have a combined net worth of $135 million rated No. 10 on The Richest Celebrity Couples list. Their combined music success list is record-breaking with their tour Soul2Soul II Tour being the highest-grossing country tour of all time.\n\nThe farm has four different homes on the property and sits on 753 acres with property details boasting \u201crolling pastures, ponds, spring fed creeks, and a 12 stall barn with a caretakers apartment.\n\nOne of the four residences is a restored log home. The real estate details say \u201cthe Antebellum home needs restoration.\u201d Antebellum in architecture refers to a time and place in history or \u201cbefore war\u201d like elegant plantation homes built in the south before the civil war. In this case, I assume it refers to the main house listed as built in 1850.\n\nRestoration or not, the sprawling farm seems like something to keep, but up for sale it is, so we get a look at southern farm living, celebrity style.\n\n~Welcome to the Tim McGraw and Faith Hill Farm\n\nThe restored log cabin. I wonder how far apart the four homes on the 753 acres are from each other?\n\nBlack and white checked kitchen fireplace with black pots and pans hanging above it reminiscent of days gone by.\n\nThe 12 stall barn with caretakers quarters.\n\nLooks like McGraw and Hill have cleared out and are not living here with no furniture in the large living area or entrance. As presented, it\u2019s more country-casual than I expected.\n\nLooking around at real estate in Franklin, Tennessee reveals quite a few big ole plantation style homes for sale in the double-digit millions I need to explore further.\n\nFor more information and photos visit the real estate agent\u2019s website Steve Fredrich of Fridrich & Clark Realty.\n\nSource: Celebrity Net Worth 2012 and Fridrich & Clark Realty.\n\nThank you so much for making Housekaboodle part of your day.\n\nJoan Rivers Penthouse is a popular Celebrity House to see plus\u2026\n\nWanna see more?
