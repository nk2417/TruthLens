The company had been struggling after one of its co-founders, Harvey Weinstein, was fired as chief executive in October after women publicly accused him of sexual misconduct stretching back decades.\n\nThe studio said in a statement that it had lined up Lantern Capital Partners, a Texas private equity firm, as a \u201cstalking horse bidder,\u201d so called because it is the first bidder in the bankruptcy process. That allows a distressed company to avoid low bids on its assets.\n\nLantern Capital will now have to compete with other potential buyers in a court-supervised auction. Andy Mitchell and Milos Brajovic of Lantern Capital said in a statement that they hoped to acquire the Weinstein Company\u2019s assets \u201cas a going concern.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/20/business/20weinstein1/20weinstein1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=f721476777e9142fb08402bf753176e826015cb3e03f919c384b74f6039adba4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/20/business/20weinstein1/20weinstein1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/20/business/20weinstein1/20weinstein1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=f721476777e9142fb08402bf753176e826015cb3e03f919c384b74f6039adba4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brooks Barnes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/weinstein-company-bankruptcy.html", "title": "Weinstein Company Files for Bankruptcy and Revokes Nondisclosure Agreements", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "As part of the filing, the studio said it released anyone \u201cwho suffered or witnessed any form of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein\u201d from nondisclosure agreements.", "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/weinstein-company-bankruptcy.html", "title": "Weinstein Company Files for Bankruptcy and Revokes Nondisclosure Agreements (Published 2018)", "description": "As part of the filing, the studio said it released anyone \u201cwho suffered or witnessed any form of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein\u201d from nondisclosure agreements.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/20/business/20weinstein1/20weinstein1-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg?year=2018&h=1687&w=3000&s=8b274e68499c07d276a830cb3444dd33aef8ea3c74dc5af6dae7931afd0dc460&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1", "alt": "The Weinstein Company had been struggling after a co-founder, Harvey Weinstein, was fired as chief executive in October after women publicly accused him of sexual misconduct stretching back decades."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/1845af8a-a501-59f3-aeae-1cef61f50ddf"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/weinstein-company-bankruptcy.html", "type": "article", "title": "Weinstein Company Files for Bankruptcy and Revokes Nondisclosure Agreements (Published 2018)", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/20/business/20weinstein1/20weinstein1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=f721476777e9142fb08402bf753176e826015cb3e03f919c384b74f6039adba4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "alt": "The Weinstein Company had been struggling after a co-founder, Harvey Weinstein, was fired as chief executive in October after women publicly accused him of sexual misconduct stretching back decades."}, "description": "As part of the filing, the studio said it released anyone \u201cwho suffered or witnessed any form of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein\u201d from nondisclosure agreements."}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-20T03:44:59.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-20T03:44:59.000Z", "section": "Business", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/brooks-barnes", "tag": "Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 100000005808048, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/1845af8a-a501-59f3-aeae-1cef61f50ddf", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/c35b64d65b7349549a81a5848da38b30", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/20/business/20weinstein1/20weinstein1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=f721476777e9142fb08402bf753176e826015cb3e03f919c384b74f6039adba4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "byl": "By Brooks Barnes", "news_keywords": "Bankruptcy,Harvey Weinstein,MeToo Movement,Sexual harassment,Weinstein,Mergers and Acquisitions", "pdate": 20180319, "CG": "business", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/weinstein-company-bankruptcy.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/1845af8a-a501-59f3-aeae-1cef61f50ddf", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/weinstein-company-bankruptcy.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/business/weinstein-company-bankruptcy.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521432000.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
