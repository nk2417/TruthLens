{"url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/bow-wow-caught-lying-about-private-jet-inspires-bowwowchallenge-for-social-media-fakery", "text": "On Monday, rapper Bow Wow Instagrammed a picture of his private jet, ostensibly in order to inform New York\u2019s ten CSI: Cyber fans of his imminent arrival. The post, innocuously captioned \u201cTravel day. NYC press run for Growing Up Hip Hop [sic]. Lets goo,\u201d easily blended in with the rest of Bow Wow\u2019s aspirational Instagram content. The problem, of course, is that Bow Wow\u2014or Shad Moss, as he would really like you to call him\u2014isn\u2019t exactly flush. In 2012, the rapper behind such hits as \u201cMo Money,\" \"Get Money,\" and \u201cMoney in the Way\u201d proved that he would not let his public love of money get in the way of shirking his child support payments. In an infamous court session, Bow Wow claimed that after over two decades in the music industry, he was only making around $4,000 a month. Furthermore, he insisted that he only had $1,500 in his checking account\u2014which, for some perspective, is the amount of money that Rick Ross has probably spent on lobsters today. By copping to his financial insolvency\u2014while conveniently failing to disclose that he had just scored a hosting gig at BET\u2014Bow Wow was able to argue that he would be incapable of paying his child\u2019s mother any more than $3,000 a month.\n\nBow Wow thought he was slick taking images on google to flex on Instagram\ud83d\ude02 #BowWowChallenge pic.twitter.com/muSwX3Ty7j \u2014 Bokenza \ud83d\udcbf (@infimiz_one) May 10, 2017\n\nOf course, the man still not known as Moss could very well have increased his assets over the past five years. Maybe he opened a 401(k). Maybe he invested his surplus $1,000 a month in Snapchat. Or, maybe, Bow Wow wasn\u2019t actually flying private. That\u2019s the theory put out by one Twitter sleuth, who spotted Bow Wow on his commercial flight and quickly uploaded the evidence to his feed. The surreptitious snap is captioned, \u201cSo this guy lil bow wow is on my flight to NY. But on instagram he posted a picture of a private jet captioned \u2018traveling to NY today\u2019 smh.\u201d Another Internet investigator with some free time on their hands (Comey, is that you?) did a reverse image search on Bow Wow\u2019s Instagram, which led to a photo from a Fort Lauderdale-based airport transportation website. In other words, it appears that the rapper pulled his sweet private plane from Google images. To Moss\u2019s credit, he seems to have attempted to cover his tracks by running the picture through Amaro. But while an Instagram filter might make a sunset seem prettier or a sorority pledge class look tanner, it can\u2019t magically make a rapper richer.\n\nFinally got my teeth fixed\n\n\n\n#bowwowchallenge pic.twitter.com/pz1ByfN31q \u2014 Luis Powell Moreno (@ComicLuisPowell) May 10, 2017\n\nIn other words, haters would say it\u2019s Photoshopped\u2014and haters would probably be right. Bow Wow\u2019s social media stunting quickly gave way to a hashtag, #bowwowchallenge, where Twitter users could share altered photos of their phony lavish lifestyles. But as many #bowwowchallenge truthers were quick to point out, faking it on Instagram isn\u2019t exactly uncommon. Who among us hasn\u2019t Facetuned our selfies on Instagram or inserted Riz Ahmed into our prom pictures?\n\nStopped by Dubai on my private jet for lunch today.

The most garden-variety social media fakery is, of course, altering one\u2019s face or body\u2014colloquially referred to as the Facetune. If a star\u2019s Instagram features a strange blur, a confusing reflection or a conspicuously wide thigh gap, it\u2019s most likely the work of a body altering app. Beyonc\u00e9, Kylie Jenner (LINK: http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/04/27/inside-kylie-jenner-s-latest-photoshop-controversy.html), Kim Kardashian, and John Mayer have all been accused of getting virtual work done on their social media posts.\n\n#BowWowChallenge should really be called the Soulja Boy Challenge. This man flexin with blank sheets of paper pic.twitter.com/ImfPkFatHk \u2014 The Daily Cookie (@TheDailyCookieB) May 10, 2017\n\nBut Bow Wow\u2019s Google image gaffe is more reminiscent of the work of two of his fellow rappers: Soulja Boy and 50 Cent. In 2014, Soulja Boy shared multiple pictures and videos of himself surrounded by hundred-dollar bills. The only problem was that the \u201cCrank That\u201d rapper had clearly stuffed his stacks with slips of blank white paper. After fans called Soulja Boy out, he deleted the offensive posts, before responding to the controversy on Twitter. \u201cI just want my fans to know that yes I was on set shooting a video and they had prop money and I took a picture with it. All my cash is real,\u201d he explained. \u201cThey had prop money at turn my swag on video 2. They always have props. But I don't want y'all to think I would fool y'all with fake stuff.\u201d\n\nMan this lunch money,I gotta go to work I'm still up, no Sleep at all. NEW MUSIC this week,Off The KANAN tape. #FRIGO #SMSAUDIO A post shared by 50 Cent (@50cent) on Oct 14, 2015 at 3:17am PDT\n\nIn 2016, 50 Cent upped the prop money ante by exhibiting a pattern of fooling with the aforementioned \u201cfake stuff.\u201d After filing for bankruptcy in Connecticut, Curtis Jackson III was forced to answer for a series of social media posts in which he appeared to be showing off his deep pockets. In response, the rapper\u2019s attorneys claimed that the stacks of money the rapper flexed on Instagram were totally bogus. \u201cThe cash depicted in the social media postings is not real,\u201d his lawyers explained. \u201cThe postings, which amongst other things, make use of stage or prop money, are part of the Debtor's routine social media marketing activities and relate directly to the Debtor's various business interests. Prop money is routinely used in the entertainment industry, including in movies, television shows, videos and social media postings.\u201d Essentially, they argued that the posts in question were crucial to maintaining the bankrupt celebrity\u2019s brand\u2014the brand of a rapper who isn\u2019t bankrupt. Other rappers have been accused of showing off their fake watches on Instagram, or stunting in luxury cars they\u2019re actually leasing.", "images": ["https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/fb.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/email-icon.svg?d=342", "https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/1741381130319.png", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/images/obsessed-header-logo-h-2.png?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/7L6PYMCE7RHEBIJZKR23DVTIJI.jpg?smart=true&auth=2558e4fc878237f3ad5bb1aa41ed598bebc770410fe3c21b06f961d190dd7689&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/app_store.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/72QNEDSQAVCFHA7Z4MRIDT3K5M.jpg?smart=true&auth=e85c64c943308a204606bc607c0e7733ba520df4c38b4e0e3d31028410470fd8&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/UCTUPE5EPFIIPIW5VZTG26ZMOM.jpg?smart=true&auth=bb6a5629ed89e004974a3247be206da35e9bd7604bec4b74908eb2b7ba188778&width=1600&height=900", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/google_play.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/twitter-icon.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/reddit.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/Q6VCSZVA2RAGNOY6RHL3JBDX7U.jpg?smart=true&auth=696d13f7ff11f29130823ec818b6cf4c2a2514821a3fc754adf0dd8b4025ae04&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/BFH2PPZ3N5AWTJGR4I7VGCQSD4.jpg?smart=true&auth=306b5742d88bb08e4375bb425722a6636b1c6e2e68736060ebab624f8c524c27&width=1440&height=1080", "https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/thedailybeast/V6FGHJOZ3JI3VLHO6ESYUVWXCQ.jpg", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/SDEZH4IJYVANHG7SB7OHOLN25Y.png?smart=true&auth=f6c5d3a487876ce737293fc82e0d933b093632d4a0460243076f5ddaaedf4e9a&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/UCTUPE5EPFIIPIW5VZTG26ZMOM.jpg?smart=true&auth=bb6a5629ed89e004974a3247be206da35e9bd7604bec4b74908eb2b7ba188778&width=1200&height=630"], "top_img": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/UCTUPE5EPFIIPIW5VZTG26ZMOM.jpg?smart=true&auth=bb6a5629ed89e004974a3247be206da35e9bd7604bec4b74908eb2b7ba188778&width=1200&height=630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Zimmerman", "Entertainment Reporter", "Got A Tip", "Send It To The Daily Beast", "Farrah Tomazin", "Julia Ornedo", "Cameron Adams", "Leigh Kimmins"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/bow-wow-caught-lying-about-private-jet-inspires-bowwowchallenge-for-social-media-fakery/", "title": "Bow Wow Caught Lying About Private Jet, Inspires #BowWowChallenge for Social Media Fakery", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "After a fan seemingly caught the rapper staging a trip on a private jet, Twitter exposed more social media fakery with the #BowWowChallenge.
