So I actually was, by my parents, taken into a mental asylum.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have one thing to say about the mental asylum,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019ve romanticized two things in my life and both have fallen short. One is being in a mental asylum. Really, really not as fun as you think it is. You do have a romantic idea of it \u2026 and it just ends up being sad and smells like s\u2014. And the other thing was boating. I recently went out on a ship in open water, and I\u2019d read Moby Dick a million times, and it really is not sexy. It\u2019s very similar to the mental asylum experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever been to a mental asylum?\u201d he added. \u201cThe only thing that defines a \u2018crazy\u2019 person and a \u2018normal\u2019 person \u2014 because you can seem very normal as a crazy person \u2014 is they\u2019re convinced they\u2019re sane. Crazy people are convinced they\u2019re sane. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nAfter being diagnosed with bipolar disorder, Harbour said he began taking medication.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s actually when the drugs came in,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been medicated bipolar for a long time. And I\u2019ve had problems going on and off. I\u2019ve had a struggle, going on and off the medications.\u201d\n\nNow, Harbour said he\u2019s found what works for him.\n\n\u201cThe funny thing about my particular brain or mental illness is every time that I\u2019ve had an episode like that, it\u2019s always coupled with spirituality,\u201d he said. \u201cGenerally, people are like, \u2018I need to meditate more\u2019 or \u2018I need to get into yoga.\u2019 And I need to like, eat a cheeseburger and just like, smoke cigarettes and hang out.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause like the minute I get close to that \u2014 what I consider a flame \u2014 of like \u2018the answers\u2019 and the mysticism \u2026 it\u2019s like I\u2019m out of my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cSo if I write the self-help book it\u2019s going to be like, \u2018Sit on the couch and play some video games.\u2019 \u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Harbour promoted the podcast on Twitter, urging anyone going through something similar to give it a listen.\n\n\u201cWith a lot of laughter and acknowledgment of how pedestrian it is to be a part of the tribe nowadays,\u201d he said. \u201cIf someone you love still suffers shame about a diagnosis, or a fellow parent worries that their bipolar kid won\u2019t be able to make it, our @WTFpod could soothe.
