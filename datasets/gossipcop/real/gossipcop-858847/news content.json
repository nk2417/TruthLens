Allman\u2019s children Devon, Layla and Delilah Island, his niece (and Duane\u2019s daughter) Galadrielle, his lifelong friend Chank Middleton and his manager Michael Lehmen delivered eulogies at the service.\n\nAs requested by Allman\u2019s estate, mourners wore jeans to the funeral instead of suits. Following the private service, hundreds of fans, many wearing Allman Brothers shirts and listening to the band\u2019s music, lined the route along the funeral procession to nearby Rose Hill Cemetery, where Allman was buried close to Duane, who died in a 1971 motorcycle accident.\n\nWhile the burial was also private, hundreds of fans gathered on a hill overlooking Allman\u2019s grave while the rocker was taken to his final resting place.\n\nIronically, Allman was scheduled to perform Saturday night at Macon\u2019s Grand Opera House before he canceled his 2017 tour plans as he battled health issues.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the 92-year-old Carter said he would attend Allman\u2019s funeral to \u201cpay his respects\u201d to the singer.\n\n\u201cRosalynn and I were deeply saddened when we learned that Gregg Allman had passed. Gregg and the Allman Brothers Band were very helpful to me in my 1976 presidential campaign. Gregg Allman was better known than I was at that time,\u201d Carter said. \u201cGregg Allman was there when I needed him and Rosalynn and I have always been grateful to him.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Carter was on hand to give Allman an honorary doctorate of humanities degree at Macon\u2019s Mercer University.\n\nAllman died May 27th at the age of 69 at his home near Savannah, Georgia following a battle with liver cancer.\n\nTrending Stories Kevin Spacey Says He Has 'No Home' After Sexual Misconduct Allegations 2025 CMA Awards: The Complete Winners List Neighbor Indicted in Murder of \u2018King of the Hill\u2019 Star Jonathan Joss \u2018Faith Is Under Attack': Nicki Minaj Spreads Misleading Information at the United Nations\n\nAllman\u2019s manager Michael Lehman said Allman spent his final night listening to tracks off his upcoming solo LP Southern Blood; a rep told Rolling Stone the album would arrive in September.\n\n\u201cHe said the last few days he was just, you know, tired,\u201d Lehman said told the Associated Press. He was looking forward to sharing it with the world and that dream is going to be realized. I told him that his legacy is going to be protected, and the gift that he gave to the music world will continue to live on forever.\u201d\n\nGregg Allman, Southern rock pioneer, fused country blues with San Francisco-style improvisation, creating a template for countless jam bands to come.
