He had already enjoyed nearly all of the accomplishments that one could hope for in his field, tasted the richest successes, won most of the major awards. Every stage of his career had been an adventure into the unknown, an improvisation in its own right, but there was truly no road map for where he was now. Everything came to an end at some point; it was a reality he accepted and confronted so often in his work, even as he tried to out-race it. What would it look like for him, he wondered, when he wrapped things up and told the crowd good night for the last time? How could it be anything other than devastating?\n\nThe work was less abundant than it used to be and nowhere near as lucrative, and so much of it seemed to be focused on finality, particularly in the form of death. In August 2012, he had appeared in an episode of Louie, the cable-TV comedy written by and starring the comedian Louis C.K., that begins with both men meeting at the grave of a comedy-club manager who has recently died, and whom they both privately despised. \u201cWhen he died, I felt nothing,\u201d Louie tells Robin. \u201cI didn\u2019t care. But I knew\u2014when I pictured him going in the ground and nobody\u2019s there, he\u2019s alone, it gave me nightmares.\u201d Robin replies, \u201cMe too.\u201d\n\nLater that fall, Robin was in New York making a film called The Angriest Man in Brooklyn, another morbid indie comedy, in which he plays its title character, a surly lawyer who is diagnosed with an aneurysm and told he has 90 minutes to live. In one scene, the character jumps off the Brooklyn Bridge into the East River, but he survives, and he is dragged from the water by the doctor who, it turns out, has falsely diagnosed him. When he described the creation of this sequence to David Letterman, the host had asked him if he needed a gamma-globulin shot, and Robin answered, \u201cI didn\u2019t get a shot, and I hope it doesn\u2019t end up, 20 years from now, I\u2019m not like Katharine Hepburn, going, [quavering voice] \u2018E-very-thing\u2019s fi-ine.\u2019\u201d", "images":
