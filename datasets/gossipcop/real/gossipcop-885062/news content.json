We couldn't believe it. The first thing, I promise, the first thing that came to mind is, like, 'I have to take a camera, so I can take pictures with all of these stars.' It didn't hit me later until, like, when I thought, \u2018Oh my God. What if we win?'\" Quintanilla says in the clip. \"We went out there and they didn't let me take my camera in, that's one of the things. I didn't get to take pictures until afterward. We were sitting there, when they announced, I had this huge knot in my stomach, I was so nervous. And then they announced the winner. I mean, we all [were so excited].\"\n\nAccording to the museum, the footage was found in a TV camera donated to its Spanish-language television project by Univision, the parent company of San Antonio\u2019s KWEX-TV, Channel 41. The video resurfaced just as the museum was planning to open a display on Hispanic Advertising that includes Quintanilla's work as a spokesperson for Coca-Cola.\n\nQuintanilla also talks about her guest role on the Televisa soap opera, Dos mujeres, un camino, as well as introduces her latest music video for her song, \"Amor Prohibido.\"\n\nEarlier this year, ET spoke with Quintanilla's family on the 22nd anniversary of her death, where they remembered the singer and continued to mourn their loss.\n\n\"Early on when she passed away, people would tell me that time heals your heart and I couldn\u2019t understand that,\" Selena's older sister, Suzette Quintanilla, said. \"It\u2019s not so much that time heals your heart, it\u2019s more that time helps you deal with what\u2019s been put in front of you.\"\n\nFor more on Quintanilla, watch below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-09/selena_quintanilla_borrowed_looks.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-03/1280_jlo_selena_fb_031717.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/selena_quintanilla_.jpg?h=709a6b0b", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/selena_quintanilla_.jpg?h=709a6b0b&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-03/et_selenadeath_031917_1280.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/selena_quintanilla_.jpg?h=709a6b0b", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/rare-selena-quintanilla-interview-found-after-20-years-watch-88680", "title": "Rare Selena Quintanilla Interview Found After 20 Years -- Watch!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/selena_quintanilla_.jpg?h=709a6b0b", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The late singer talks about winning her GRAMMY and guest role on 'Dos mujeres, un camino.'", "title": "Rare Selena Quintanilla Interview Found After 20 Years -- Watch!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/rare-selena-quintanilla-interview-found-after-20-years-watch-88680", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The late singer talks about winning her GRAMMY and guest role on 'Dos mujeres, un camino.'", "twitter": {"description": "The late singer talks about winning her GRAMMY and guest role on 'Dos mujeres, un camino.'", "title": "Rare Selena Quintanilla Interview Found After 20 Years -- Watch!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/rare-selena-quintanilla-interview-found-after-20-years-watch-88680", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/selena_quintanilla_.jpg?h=709a6b0b", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Rare Selena Quintanilla Interview Found After 20 Years -- Watch! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, Music, News, Selena Quintanilla", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
