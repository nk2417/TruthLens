family members to new $7.5 million guest home in Los Angeles, more than a year after putting her own Hollywood Hills mansion on the market.\n\nThe four bedroom, five bathroom property in upscale Beverly Hills will reportedly be used communally by those closest to the American star, whose bid to offload her listed home resulted the price being lowered in July.\n\nSpread over 4,400 square feet, the lavish Spanish style house includes tasteful French doors, a large outdoor area and sweeping manicured lawns.\n\nGenerous gesture: Katy Perry has treated her closest friends and family members to new $7.5 million guest home in Los Angeles, more than a year after putting her own Hollywood Hills mansion on the market\n\nLovely: The four bedroom, five bathroom property in upscale Beverly Hills will reportedly be used communally by those closest to the American star, whose bid to offload her listed home resulted the price being lowered in July\n\nA large outdoor pool and seating area affords tenants plenty of space to relax and unwind, while its acres of space is perfect for those hoping to make the most of the balmy Californian sunshine.\n\nThe property is nestled within the heart of an exclusive gated community, with previous celebrity residents including Adele, Ellen Degeneres, Jennifer Lawrence and married couple Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis.\n\nNeutral decor and minimalist furnishings prove to be recurring theme throughout the home, with a tasteful living room featuring fitted bookshelves surrounding a large, widescreen television.\n\nGreen with envy: Spread over 4,400 square feet, the lavish Spanish style house includes tasteful French doors, a large outdoor area and sweeping manicured lawns\n\nDive in: A large outdoor pool and seating area affords the occupier plenty of space to relax and unwind\n\nElsewhere a modest, open-plan kitchen and breakfast nook sits adjacent to a polished glass table - an ideal spot for early morning coffee.\n\nGiven Katy's musical background it's little surprise to find a piano in another of the property's tastefully decorated rooms, surrounded by welcoming sofas, chairs and a roaring open fireplace.\n\nThe dining room table can comfortably seat ten, while patio doors look out on the property's neatly manicured back garden.\n\nUpstairs the inviting master bedroom includes a huge amount of space, filled with comfortable chairs, a sofa and obligatory double bed.\n\nInvite only: The property is nestled within the heart of an exclusive gated community, with previous celebrity residents including Adele, Ellen Degeneres, Jennifer Lawrence and married couple Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis\n\nBird's eye view: An overhead shot shows the property surrounded by shrubbery, while a long driveway sis behind its large gate\n\nCome on in: The living room features neutral cream decor and fitted book shelves surrounding a large, wide-screen television\n\nKaty's purchase comes just months after she reportedly slashed a further $335,000 from the price of her extravagant Beverly Hills compound in a desperate bid to offload the property she originally put on the market in September.\n\nThe American singer, 33, was said to be open to offers of $8.95 million (\u00a36,741,274) for the Mediterranean style property, which encompasses a four bedroom house, guest house, security building, separate fitness studio and an enormous outdoor pool.\n\nKaty originally listed the sprawling home 13-months ago, but a lack of offers is understood to have resulted in a modest reduction on its original $9.285 million valuation.\n\nDespite the marginally lower price, Katy is still set to make a modest profit from the property she purchased from heiress Aileen Getty for $8.2 million.\n\nPlay us a tune: A piano sits in one corner, surrounded by welcoming sofas, chairs and a roaring open fireplace\n\nSettle down: A polished glass table sits adjacent to the property's modest, open-plan kitchen and breakfast nook\n\nLet's eat: The dining room table can comfortably seat ten, while patio doors look out on the property's neatly manicured back garden\n\nRooms with a view: Open doors offer a glimpse of the tasteful dining room (L) and minimalist hallway (R)\n\nWalk this way: An open staircase leads guests up the second floor of the stunning Spanish style home\n\nRest and relaxation: The inviting master bedroom includes a huge amount of space, filled with comfortable chairs, a sofa and obligatory double bed\n\nWash and go: The bathroom includes huge mirrors and plenty of storage space for toiletries\n\nThe singer also owns a separate five bedroom, and five and a half bathroom property, covering 2,815 sq ft and tucked away in its own gated community.\n\nAccording to Katy paid just under $19 million for the home, which was not officially on the market, in April 2017, according to TMZ.\n\nMailOnline has contacted a representative for further comment.\n\nPreviously: The singer also owns a separate five bedroom, and five and a half bathroom property, covering 2,815 sq ft and tucked away in its own gated community (pictured)", "images":
