revelation and her responsibility as a role model.\n\nShe came back from a two-year career break to win her fifth US national title in August while wearing a teal leotard - the designated colour to represent survivors of sexual abuse.\n\nAnd she returns to international competition at the World Championships in Qatar this month.\n\n\"I think it was very important to support the fellow gymnasts it had happened to and to speak up for what you believe in and say 'I don't think this is right' and I hope I gave them courage to come out and tell their stories one day if they want to,\" she said.\n\n\"People do look up to me so if they can see Simone can be strong enough then hopefully I can too - and that's the message I wanted to give.\n\n\"It kind of felt empowering even though I know that is an overused word right now.\"\n\nOhio-born Biles says she was \"relieved\" after speaking out, after feeling \"a lot of pressure\" to keep the truth to herself for so long.\n\nBiles praised Judge Rosemarie Aquilina who sentenced Nasser, and she says he \"got what he deserved\".\n\n\"The judge was absolutely amazing on her part, so we were very proud of her, and it is kind of a relief because [Nassar] got what he deserved and he almost got as many years [in prison] as [he abused] girls.\n\n\"It's kind of crazy because I can't be the one to save everything, but as long as I do my job and everyone is pleased maybe I'll save something.\"", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/8d1b/live/bb5b4550-c528-11f0-bf7b-db7c049674ab.jpg",
