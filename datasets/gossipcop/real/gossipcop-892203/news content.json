Though the show was initially met with mixed reviews, it went on to become a huge success, running until 2003. Tess\u2019 playful sarcasm and no-nonsense attitude added something of a humorous edge to the wholesome show, and she became its most beloved character.\n\nReese was plagued with health problems later in life, including a battle with diabetes which she blamed on poor diet and exercise.
