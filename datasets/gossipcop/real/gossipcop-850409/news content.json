Now, seven years into their romance, they share a life, a child, and a long future together.\n\n\u201cHe makes me feel beautiful every single moment of the day, even when we have fought,\u201d the Fabletics founder told People in 2020. \u201cI still feel loved. His devotion to the family unit makes me feel safe and confident and secure.\u201d\n\nBelow, everything we know about the musician and his relationship with the actor.\n\nHe and Hudson have known each other for more than two decades.\n\nCharley Gallay // Getty Images\n\nAlthough Fujikawa and Hudson confirmed their relationship\u2014with a sweet red-carpet debut\u2014in May 2017, the pair had actually known each other for 15 years prior. Hudson told The Talk hosts that she first met Fujikawa through friends Sara and Erin Foster.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for 15 years. He\u2019s my best friend\u2019s stepbrother,\u201d . \u201cWe kinda skipped through the part of knowing what the hiccups were. You kinda skip the part of going, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re like that?\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\nShe added, \u201cIn terms of family, I\u2019ve known his family forever. To have that connection is really powerful.\u2019\n\n\n\nHe's a musician.\n\nGetty Images\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say Hudson has a thing for rockers after previously being with The Black Crowes\u2019 Chris Robinson and Muse\u2019s Matthew Bellamy. Fujikawa is the former lead singer and guitarist for the L.A.\u2013based folk rock band Chief, which he cofounded with his brother Michael Fujikawa. The group is now disbanded, but still remain friendly. Fujikawa posted a photo with his former bandmates on Instagram on April 30, which prompted many fans to wonder whether Chief was making a comeback.\n\n\n\nHe founded his own record company.\n\n\n\n\n\nFujikawa founded Lightwave Records in Los Angeles in 2013, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nHe went to NYU.\n\nGetty Images\n\nFujikawa's LinkedIn profile also states that he went to New York University starting in 2004, where he studied music. However, he decided to drop out in 2005. His activities while attending the school consisted of \u201cbartending at Lit lounge, lots of walking, and not going to school.\u201d\n\nHe has two brothers.\n\nTheir names are Michael and Brady Fujikawa, and the part-Japanese siblings were all raised in Los Angeles. Fujikawa shared the adorable throwback above for one of his brothers' birthdays.\n\nThey have a child together.\n\nThe couple welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Rani Rose Hudson Fujikawa, on October 2, 2018. \u201cWe have decided to name our daughter Rani (pronounced Ronnie) after her grandfather, Ron Fujikawa,\u201d the actor wrote on Instagram. \u201cRon was the most special man who we all miss dearly. To name her after him is an honor.\u201dShe added, \u201cEveryone is doing well and happy as can be. Our family thanks you for all the love and blessings that have been sent our way and we send ours right back.\u201d\n\nHudson announced the news of her pregnancy in April 2018, with an Instagram video of her exciting gender-reveal party.\n\n\u201cMy kids, Danny, myself and the entire family are crazy excited!\u201d she captioned the post, adding that she and her beau had \u201ca little girl on the way.\u201d Hudson also has two other children, Ryder Russell Robinson, 20, and Bingham Hawn Bellamy, 13, from previous relationships with Chris Robinson and Matt Bellamy, respectively.\n\nStephane Cardinale - Corbis // Getty Images\n\nThey got engaged in 2021.\n\nIn 2019, Hudson revealed to The Telegraph that she was considering getting married to Fujikawa. She said, \u201cWe think about that a lot. Marriage is definitely not a golden ticket\u2014it's not going to solve any challenges in a relationship. But as someone who's lived through \u2026 well, trial and error, I think that the symbolism of marriage, that commitment, is more important to kids than we sometimes think.\u201d\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t long before Fujikawa officially popped the question. On September 13, 2021, Hudson shared a photo of the two kissing atop a mountain, with her wearing her new engagement ring. \u201cLet\u2019s go!
