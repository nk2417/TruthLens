His performance in the latter earned him multiple accolades, including the Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Musical (making him the youngest solo recipient of the award at the time),[2] a Daytime Emmy, and a Grammy Award.[3] Platt reprised the role of Evan Hansen in the 2021 film adaptation of the musical, produced by his father.[4] His portrayal of Leo Frank in the 2023 Broadway revival of Parade earned him nominations for a Tony and a Grammy.\n\nPlatt's film credits include the Pitch Perfect film series (2012\u20132017), Ricki and the Flash (2015), Run This Town (2019), and Theater Camp (2023), the latter of which he also co-wrote.

Platt attended Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles, graduating in 2011. He then enrolled at Columbia University in New York but dropped out after seven weeks to fulfill his contract with The Book of Mormon. During his time at Columbia, he was a member of the campus a cappella musical group Nonsequitur.[8][13][14]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\n2002\u20132014: Early stage and The Book of Mormon [ edit ]\n\nAt 9 years old, Platt played Winthrop Paroo in The Music Man at the Hollywood Bowl alongside Kristin Chenoweth.[15] At 11, he appeared in a brief national tour of Caroline, or Change, by Jeanine Tesori and Tony Kushner.

The show premiered at the Bank of America Theatre on December 19, 2012, after a week of previews.[17] The production was well received and closed on October 6, 2013.[18] Critics lauded Platt's performance, calling him a \"true revelation in this brand new Chicago production... He really leans into this part, throwing himself out there with the abandonment of youth\".[19] Platt later reprised his role as Elder Cunningham on Broadway at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre from January 7, 2014, to January 6, 2015.[20]\n\n2015\u20132017: Film work and Dear Evan Hansen [ edit ]\n\nIn 2012, Platt had a supporting role in the musical comedy Pitch Perfect, loosely based on the non-fiction book Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory. Platt played the magic-loving Benji Applebaum, alongside an ensemble cast including Anna Kendrick, Skylar Astin, Rebel Wilson, Adam DeVine, Anna Camp, and Brittany Snow. The film emerged as a major commercial success and received mostly positive reviews from critics. He was subsequently nominated at the 2013 Teen Choice Awards in the Choice Movie Scene Stealer category for his work.[21] In 2015, Platt reprised his role as Benji Applebaum in the sequel, Pitch Perfect 2, followed by appearances in the films Ricki and the Flash and Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.\n\nPlatt became attached to Steven Levenson and Pasek and Paul's then Untitled P&P Project in 2014, participating in early read-throughs and workshops.[22] By 2015, the musical, titled Dear Evan Hansen, had begun production in Washington, D.C. at the Arena Stage with Platt originating the title role. The show premiered on July 9, 2015, and it closed on August 23, 2015.[23] The overwhelming positive reception toward the production and Platt's performance resulted in the show being transferred to Off-Broadway.[24]\n\nIn 2016, Platt once again originated the role of Evan Hansen at Second Stage Theatre. Platt and the cast played a month of previews, beginning on March 26, 2016, before premiering on May 1, 2016. The limited engagement sold out its entire run with Platt playing his last performance on May 26, 2016.[25]\n\nBen Platt and Cynthia Erivo look over a special collections display during a tour of the Library of Congress in 2023.\n\nIn December 2016, Platt originated the title role in Dear Evan Hansen on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre.

The film premiered at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival on April 1, 2021, and was released in the United States on July 23, 2021.[39][40][41]\n\nIn January 2019, Platt announced that his debut studio album Sing to Me Instead was scheduled for release on March 29, 2019.

The project is set to be shot over the course of twenty years, with principal photography of the first sequence of the film having already been completed prior to the announcement.[46][47] On January 10, 2023, it was announced that Jenner would be replaced by Paul Mescal.[48]\n\nPlatt starred as Payton Hobart on the Netflix comedy-drama series The Politician, which tells the story of a very driven teen convinced that he's destined to become President of the United States.[49] Platt's casting was announced in March 2018,[50] and the series premiered on September 27, 2019.[51] He received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy for his performance in the series' first season.[52]\n\nPlatt released a new single, \"So Will I\", on May 8, 2020.[53] On May 20, 2020, Platt released Sing to Me Instead (Deluxe), which includes \"So Will I\", \"Rain\", and six songs recorded live at Radio City Music Hall, including cover versions of Brandi Carlile's \"The Joke\" and Elton John's \"Take Me to the Pilot\".[54] On June 8, 2020, Platt released \"Everything I Did to Get to You\", a new single written by David Davis, which he picked as the winner of his episode of NBC's songwriting competition show Songland.[55]\n\n2021\u2013present: Reverie, Parade and other projects [ edit ]\n\nIn April 2021, Platt teased the chorus of his new single, \"Imagine\", on TikTok. The complete song was released on April 23, 2021, followed by a remix by Dutch electronic producer Ti\u00ebsto on May 28, 2021.[56] In July, he announced on Twitter that his second studio album, Reverie, for which \"Imagine\" was released as its first single, would be released on August 13, 2021.

It premiered as the Opening Night Gala Presentation of the 2021 Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2021, followed by a release in theaters on September 24, 2021, in time for Platt's 28th birthday.[61][62][63] Upon the release of the film's first trailer on May 18, 2021, the casting of Platt as Evan Hansen and the appearance of the film's version of the character received substantial criticism, with viewers commenting that he, at age 27, was too old to play a high schooler. Platt, however, dismissed the response, comparing his age to those of actors who played high school students in the 1978 film Grease.[64] The criticism against the casting went even further, with emerging claims that nepotism was involved in the decision. On August 8, 2021, in an interview with Zach Sang on his YouTube talk show, Platt said \"I think the reaction is largely from people who don't understand the context of the piece \u2014 the fact that I created the role and workshopped it for three years ... Were I not to do the movie, it probably wouldn't get made. And so, I think, my defensive response is to want to go onto Twitter and be like, 'F you, guys. You don't even know that this wouldn't exist without me.' Of course, that's not true entirely and not my place to say. All I have to do is let the work speak for itself.\"[65]\n\nOn March 2, 2021, it was announced that Platt was in talks to star in the film adaptation of Grant Ginder's novel The People We Hate at the Wedding. His casting was announced on July 8, 2021, along with Amazon Studios being confirmed to produce the film.

The revival began previews on February 22, 2023, and opened on March 16, 2023, at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre. The limited run concluded on August 6, 2023.[73] High demand for tickets on the first day of sale resulted in temporarily crashing the Telecharge ticket site, resulting in error messages and queues of an hour long.[74] On the night of the show's first preview, members of the neo-Nazi group National Socialist Movement protested against the production outside the theater.[75] The cast album for the production was released by Interscope Records on March 23, 2023.[76] For his performance as Leo Frank, Platt received his second Tony nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical.\n\nOn June 9, 2022, it was announced that Platt would produce and star in the musical comedy film Theater Camp, inspired by the 2020 short film of the same name he co-wrote with Noah Galvin, Molly Gordon, and Nick Lieberman.[77][78] The film had its world premiere at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival on January 21, 2023, and was acquired shortly after by Searchlight Pictures for a theatrical release beginning July 14, 2023.[79][80][81] The movie soundtrack featuring original songs written by Platt, Galvin, Gordon, and Lieberman was released on the same day by Interscope Records.
