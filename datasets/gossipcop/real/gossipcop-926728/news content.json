People Magazine called her the \"iconic Hollywood bad girl of the 90s.\" She had a reputation for heavy partying, on-set lateness, physical fights, and a heated feud with her Beverly Hills, 90210 co-star Jennie Garth. During her time on Charmed, her bad reputation continued to grow. Rumors of a feud with co-star Alyssa Milano are said to have fueled her exit from the show. Rumor has it Doherty was fired by Aaron Spelling after an ultimatum from Milano. Doherty left both Beverly Hills, 90210, and Charmed acrimoniously.\n\nHealth & Death\n\nIn March 2015, Doherty was diagnosed with breast cancer that had spread to her lymph nodes.

This wasn't possible, and a single mastectomy was performed in May 2016.
