News , a witness confirmed that the 45-year-old Oscar winner paused his stroll with his girlfriend to sign autographs and have selfies taken with fans who happen to pass them by before they proceeded to Barney\u2019s New York. After that, they made their way back to Ben\u2019s hotel.\n\nBoth of them were sporting what appears to be a matching pair of black leather bomber jacket in the morning and both ditched it for a more casual attire for their date night, E! News added.\n\nBen Affleck and Lindsay Shookus\u2019 Big Date in the Big Apple https://t.co/5z6E0xNFLV \u2014 E! News (@enews) August 21, 2017\n\nBased on the outlet\u2019s report on Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus\u2019 date night in New York, the couple reportedly dined at a French-American restaurant situated at the heart of Greenwich Village, New York City called the Mas (farmhouse).\n\nDuring that night, Ben donned a blue sport coat and corduroy trousers matched with his familiar red t-shirt while Lindsay wore a black top, skinny jeans, and a pair of nude wedges.\n\nSeeing the new couple on their Sunday date in New York was not surprising for fans considering that they have already confirmed their relationship early in July by making a public appearance together in Los Angeles, three months after his divorce with actress, Jennifer Gardner, in April 2017.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than a summer fling,\u201d someone reportedly knowledgeable of the situation told E! News .\n\n\u201cThey are having fun and care for each other. It\u2019s early and they are taking it slow.\u201d\n\nBased on the source\u2019s statement, Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus had been trying to keep their relationship low profile before they were spotted out-and-about in L.A. on July 6.\n\n\u201cThey had a table for two, but were sitting very close to one another,\u201d E! News\u2019 eyewitness said.\n\n\u201cBen and Lindsay were very intimate and touchy the entire dinner. They kept whispering in each other\u2019s ears and Ben was quite touchy with Lindsay.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, they even shared a plate for a couple of dishes and left the restaurant \u201cwalking very closely together.\u201d\n\nHowever, neither of the two have made any comment to confirm nor deny their relationship.\n\nBased on E! News\u2019 report, what is left now is for them to make it \u201cred carpet official,\u201d as most Hollywood couples do. In fact, they haven\u2019t even made it Instagram or Twitter official yet.\n\nWith that said, who\u2019s to say that they\u2019re just friends who happened to color-coordinate their outfits every time they get together? Better take the speculations down a notch until we know more.\n\nWhat do you think of this article about Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus?
