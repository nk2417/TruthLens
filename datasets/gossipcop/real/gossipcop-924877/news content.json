This time, the crew was abuzz with rumors that exes Kristen Doute and James Kennedy hooked up during their trip to Mexico.\n\nHow to Watch Vanderpump Rules Season 12 premieres on Tuesday, December 2 at 9/8c on Bravo and streams next day on Peacock. Watch \u00e2Raise Your Glass to 11 Seasons\u00e2 special on Tuesday, November 25 at 9/8c on Bravo. Stream on\n\nKristen and James both denied that the alleged hookup took place during Monday night's episode of Vanderpump Rules. And Kristen wasn't backing down from her stance during her appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen Monday, even as one caller questioned why we should believe her this time, considering the fact that she hasn't exactly been honest about hookups in the past. \"Because I'm telling the truth, that's why!\" Kristen responded to the caller on WWHL (clip above). \"Did you see the scene? That's why. He did not say it.\"\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\nKristen is referring to the moment when Tom Sandoval asked James if he had hung out with Kristen the night before their golf outing, to which he replied, \"I mean, a little bit, but not really.\" However, this got misinterpreted as James admitting that he and Kristen hooked up with each other. Kristen said on WWHL that her \"brain exploded\" when she realized that James had never actually said that they hooked up, especially since she became so upset with him, to the point where she threw a drink in his face during one group dinner in Mexico.\n\nKristen Denies the Rumor Involving James Kennedy\n\n\n\n\n\nThough Kristen took out her frustration on several members of the Vanderpump Rules crew during the episode, she said that she was the most angry with Sandoval and Jax Taylor during the whole ordeal. \"Sandoval started it, and Jax really spread the rumor,\" she explained on WWHL.\n\nKristen will have to break the news of the gossip to her boyfriend Brian Carter when she gets back from Mexico in an all-new episode of Vanderpump Rules Monday at 9/8c, which you're not going to want to miss.
