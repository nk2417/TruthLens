It's actually because of my son that I met Joaquim. I have a friend who told me about the Valente brothers and their martial art school, and since I wanted to steer my almost-teenage son in the right direction, I thought he might be interested in this,\u201d she says. \u201cInitially, I wasn\u2019t even considering it for myself, to be honest with you. But, when I brought him to the first class and started talking with Joaquim, I realized that it was much more than self-defense. I became really interested [in] the philosophy. It felt very much in line with what I believe in and look for in my life, and how I have a path to develop and become the best version of myself. It sounded like something I definitely wanted to learn more about.
