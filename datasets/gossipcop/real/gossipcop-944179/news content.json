Merritt/Getty On Riverdale, Apa's Archie Andrews is at the center of a love triangle with Betty (Lili Reinhart) and Veronica (Camila Mendes) \u2014 but in real life, Apa seems to spend most of his free time shirtless and hilariously trolling Cole Sprouse. If we learned anything from scanning Apa's Instagram, it's that dating is so overrated.\n\n02 of 10 LILI REINHART & COLE SPROUSE Jamie McCarthy/Getty For Lili Reinhart and Cole Sprouse, a.k.a. Bughead \u2014 Riverdale's cutest couple, in our opinion \u2014 finding love while starring on the hit CW show was expected considering their onscreen counterparts were the object of many a fan's affection. The actors kept their relationship status under wraps until the pair made their red carpet debut as a couple at the 2018 Met Gala. Despite the move, Reinhart refuses to comment on the relationship, telling Harper's Bazaar in an interview: \"I'm not okay talking about my relationship. I'm not going to tell you my love story. That's just not appropriate right now.\"\n\n03 of 10 CAMILA MENDES Broadimage/REX/Shutterstock The actress may be single now \u2014 she and boyfriend Victor Houston reportedly called it quits after a few months of dating \u2014 but that doesn't mean Mendes is sulking ... or at least that's what we see on Instagram. Archie's leading lady has since starred in a music video for The Chainsmokers and has mastered the art of the photobooth with her on-screen dad.\n\n04 of 10 MADELAINE PETSCH & TRAVIS MILLS Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic Madelaine Petsch first met actor-musician boyfriend Travis Mills when he was up for the role of Jughead, but the romance didn't take-off until they reconnected online. \"He messaged me on Facebook in January of season one and congratulated me on the show. He had auditioned for Jughead,\" she told Cosmopolitian in 2017. \"I think we just randomly had mutual friends, so we added each other.\" \"We kept in touch very rarely, not even that much, from January to February, and then the day I got back from season one in February I was bored in L.A., believe it or not,\" she continued. \"I was like, 'What am I gonna do?' I got my hair cut and he texted me like, 'Let's go to a movie!' We hung out and spent every single day together that I've been in L.A. since then, since February.\"\n\n05 of 10 CASEY COTT He may have played Sabrina Carpenter's boyfriend in the singer's music video for \"Why,\" but Casey Cott (he plays BFF Kevin Keller) has kept his dating life off social media. But who needs to document an S.O. when endless karaoke outings take up most of your time and feed?\n\n06 of 10 JORDAN CONNOR & JINJARA MITCHELL Credit: Jordan Connor/Instagram Jordan Connor, a.k.a. Sweetpea, recently celebrated five years with longtime girlfriend Jinjara Mitchell, an actress who most recently starred in another CW show, Life Sentence. The couple doesn't hold back when it comes to posting photos together on Instagram \u2014 in fact, they do it quite often and accompany the cute pics with even cuter captions. \"My only weakness!\" Connor captioned this snapshot, referring to Mitchell.\n\n07 of 10 MARK CONSUELOS & KELLY RIPA Kelly Ripa/Instagram Talk about a power couple! Mark Consuelos \u2014 who plays Veronica's dad, Hiram Lodge \u2014 and Kelly Ripa have been serving big-time relationship goals since the pair worked together in All My Children in the '90s. And after all these years, the married couple still can't get enough of each other, as has been made evident in their PDA-packed Instagram posts and interviews. \"I'm bananas over my wife,\" Consuelos said during a Watch What Happens Live appearance.\n\n08 of 10 MARISOL NICHOLS & TARON LEXTON Jeff Vespa/WireImage 24 alumna Marisol Nichols, who plays Veronica's mom, wed director Taron Lexton in April 2008. \"I can't believe I get this man for the rest of my life,\" said Nichols, following the pair's nuptials. \"We're so happy we can hardly stand it.\"\n\n09 of 10 LUKE PERRY Gabriel Olsen/FilmMagic The Beverly Hills, 90210 alum and '90s heartthrob may have dated an impressive roster of leading ladies back in the day, but Perry currently seems to be riding solo, and happily so.",
