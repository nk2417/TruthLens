The idea quickly took on a life of its own, and somehow, the two agreed to start a fitness line together as well \u2014 forcing Khlo\u00e9 to put her already-in-the-works athleisure line with her clothing company, Good American, on hold.\n\nBut Kourtney struggled to commit fully to the massive responsibility of the project, and soon enough, her sister had had it.\n\n\u201cKourtney and I are a nothing brand right now. We\u2019re just not seeing eye-to-eye,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I love having a partner, but when you\u2019re just not in sync, it\u2019s a little frustrating.\u201d\n\nEventually, she realized she wasn\u2019t going to get what she needed from Kourtney, who herself acknowledged that the two sisters have different priorities.\n\n\u201cI was hoping you and I could do something together, but it doesn\u2019t really seem like this train is moving at the speed I want it to move,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9. \u201cFor now, I think it\u2019s smart for me to move forward with Good American in doing this kind of stuff.\u201d\n\n\u201cGo for it, girl,\u201d said Kourtney, admitting that she\u2019s not \u201cthe fastest-moving person\u201d and tends to \u201cprocrastinate.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re like Nate Dogg \u2014 you\u2019re only good for hooks,\u201d quipped Khlo\u00e9. \u201cYou can\u2019t sell your own album.\u201d\n\nMedia Training\n\nAfter undergoing her own media training, Kim realized how beneficial it was and asked her family to give it a shot.\n\n\u201cI just think it\u2019ll be a really good idea to get prepared and have everyone face our fears,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you could ever be too prepared. It was so helpful for me just to be aware of the things I\u2019m saying \u2014 I don\u2019t think the answer is to retreat. You have be prepared that some day, you might be asked a question you don\u2019t want to answer.\u201d\n\nAfter some coaxing, Kim convinced Kris, Kourtney, Khlo\u00e9 and Kendall to meet with two communications coaches from Clarity media training. (Kylie, whom multiple sources have confirmed to PEOPLE is pregnant and expecting her first child with rapper Travis Scott next year, has been largely absent from this season thus far and did not partake in the training.)\n\nThroughout the session, the family underwent an on-camera mock group interview followed by individual ones, then re-watched the tapes to critique their answers \u2014 and suffice it to say that the coaches did not hold back. After opening their line of questioning by bringing up Kim\u2019s sex tape, they went on to cover everything from Kendall\u2019s Pepsi commercial to Rob\u2019s explosive behavior, forcing Kris and her daughters to answer some of the most uncomfortable and personal questions about their family.\n\nFor the momager, that focused almost entirely on her strained \u2014 and today, essentially nonexistent \u2014 relationship with her ex-spouse Caitlyn Jenner. After Kendall, 22, admitted that she and her sister Kylie, 20, \u201ckept a lot\u201d of their father\u2019s secrets over the years from Kris, she confessed that that was what hurt her the most.\n\n\u201cThere were things that happened that they didn\u2019t tell me, because they were told not to,\u201d said Kris, 62, in reference to any signs that Caitlyn (formerly known as Bruce) wanted to be a woman.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not resentful about it, it just makes me really sad,\u201d she continued. \u201cBecause I\u2019m a protective mom \u2014 I would do anything for my kids. And had I known some of the things they were experiencing \u2026 it just broke my heart, hearing some of that stuff.\u201d (Kris also said her ex\u2019s tell-all memoir was \u201cfull of inaccuracies.\u201d)\n\nWhen asked about her protest-themed Pepsi commercial \u2014 which the company pulled days after it was accused of trivializing the Black Lives Matter movement following its release in April \u2014 Kendall prickled, but acknowledged it was definitely a \u201chuge learning lesson.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of things that were blinding me,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of people I had faith in, a lot of things I had trust in.\u201d\n\nAfter commenting on her defensive body language, the coaches suggested Kendall tackle the topic more directly in the future.\n\n\u201cI have learned so much over the last four years of my career,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that the only person that\u2019s ever going to truly, truly look out for me is me. It is really hard work.\u201d\n\nThe coaches decided to ask Khlo\u00e9 about her reclusive brother Rob, 30, who is known to make headlines for his contentious relationship with his ex Blac Chyna, 29.\n\n\u201cRob definitely wears his heart on his sleeve, and when he loves he loves really, really hard,\u201d she responded. \u201cWith that being said, when he gets hurt, he hurts really, really badly.\u201d\n\nFor Kourtney, the coaches focused their questions on her ex Scott Disick \u2014 and the mother of three flailed helplessly, giving up altogether at one point and laughing nervously. But ultimately, all of the women walked away from the experience with newfound confidence and knowledge.\n\n\u201cWell, that wasn\u2019t fun,\u201d admitted Kris. \u201cBut I truly do see some value in this whole process. We live our entire lives in front of the whole world and questions like this are going to keep coming for as long as I can foresee, so it really does help to have some skills under my belt to convey what I\u2019m trying to say.\u201d\n\nKendall and Kylie Drama\n\nMeanwhile, Kendall and her noticeably absent sister Kylie were going through some issues of their own. The two were trying to arrange a birthday party for a friend and wound up at each other\u2019s throats over their \u201ctwo completely different ideas.\u201d\n\nIn the middle of the media training session, Kendall stormed out, driven almost to tears over the situation \u2014 but within hours, they had worked it out off-camera.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy because Kylie and I, there\u2019s always something,\u201d said Kendall. \u201cWe fought, and then she literally came over that night and helped me make a whole dinner for me and 20 of my friends. So we end up butting heads sometimes, but at the end of the day, she\u2019s my sister.\u201d\n\nThe spotlight on Kris\n\nTo cap off the episode, Kris decided to put her media training to use for an interview conducted by basketball legend Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for The Hollywood Reporter, answering questions spanning everything from the \u201csexual nature\u201d of her daughters\u2019 photos (\u201cI\u2019m very comfortable if they\u2019re comfortable\u201d) to their influence on plastic surgery trends (\u201cIf something \u2026 makes you feel better about yourself, then why not? I think everybody has to make their own choice.\u201d).\n\nHer final word of advice for anyone squirming away from certain topics? \u201cExpect the tough questions\u201d \u2014 and have \u201csome sense of preparedness\u201d so that you feel confident in answering them.\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians returns Jan. 7 at 9 p.m. ET on E!", "images":
