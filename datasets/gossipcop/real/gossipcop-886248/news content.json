Many folks in Hollywood have come out against his alleged actions, including A-listers such as Jennifer Lawrence, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Meryl Streep, and more. However, others are willing to either hold back judgment or outright defend him. Apparently, Lindsay Lohan falls in the latter camp.\n\nIn a recent Instagram story (that was deleted almost as quickly as it was posted), Lindsay recorded herself saying, \"I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now. I don't think it's right what's going on.\" In the video, she put an angel emoji under the name Harvey, a strange choice regardless of circumstance. Notably, the video was posted shortly after news broke that Weinstein's wife, Georgina Chapman, is leaving him, which Lindsay also commented on.", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/6916343ca33473dcfd6aac43/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/690cc01e66ddff16cb311bd3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/59de0f1c1b220755d82e3d55/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-692235460.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/68ff9a615d6b62c3d564441c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/690cde7a1c5c64107ca61f86/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/691d309e945261fe6eb5c277/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6908db9e6df9c40528ad1e6b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/59de0f1c1b220755d82e3d55/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-692235460.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/69026e16a3d6f55983565e94/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/690cb7101c5c64107ca61f5f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/68fb97fea6008a82c6ee2ce9/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/60d38c788031bcac62649a08/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/68ffc2fc17161b136b0dcc07/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/690117fe232c4178c6e9eba8/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/691c86e7f1cc5368765fd578/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/59de0f1c1b220755d82e3d55/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-692235460.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rosemary Donahue"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/lindsay-lohan-defends-harvey-weinstein-criticizes-georgina-chapman", "title": "Lindsay Lohan Defends Harvey Weinstein, Says Georgina Chapman Should \"Be There for Her Husband\"", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Rosemary Donahue", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Lindsey Lohan just took to Instagram to defend Harvey Weinstein in the wake of a slew of sexual harassment and assault accusations against him.", "id": "59de0b0e8ba03d6a578a1ce5", "keywords": "harvey weinstein,lindsey lohan,sexual harassment,sexual assault", "news_keywords": "harvey weinstein,lindsey lohan,sexual harassment,sexual assault", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59de0b0e8ba03d6a578a1ce5", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Lindsey Lohan just took to Instagram to defend Harvey Weinstein in the wake of a slew of sexual harassment and assault accusations against him.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/59de0f1c1b220755d82e3d55/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-692235460.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/59de0f1c1b220755d82e3d55/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-692235460.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\"I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now.\"", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/59de0f1c1b220755d82e3d55/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-692235460.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Lindsay Lohan Just Criticized Harvey Weinstein's Wife for Leaving Him After Assault Allegations", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/lindsay-lohan-defends-harvey-weinstein-criticizes-georgina-chapman"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-10-11T13:37:33.894Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-11T13:37:33.894Z", "author": "Rosemary Donahue"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "\"I feel very bad for Harvey Weinstein right now.\"", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/59de0f1c1b220755d82e3d55/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-692235460.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Lindsay Lohan Just Criticized Harvey Weinstein's Wife for Leaving Him After Assault Allegations"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/59de0f1c1b220755d82e3d55/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/GettyImages-692235460.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507729053.894, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
