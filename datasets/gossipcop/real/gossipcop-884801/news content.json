Bersten filled in as Lachey's partner in Chmerkovskiy's absence, just like he did last season when Chmerkovskiy suffered a calf injury while rehearsing with Glee star Heather Morris.\n\n\"Thank you @alanbersten for doing a great job stepping in for me.....again!\" he joked. \"#DWTS.\"\n\nA source previously told ET that Chmerkovskiy skipped the show due to an ongoing conflict with the former Total Request Live host.\n\n\"They were acting like they had great chemistry, when really they were just faking it to seem more likeable to the fans,\" the source said. \"Things got heated between the two this week ... it was nothing specific, just little disagreements that escalated.\"\n\nHear more on the rumored feud in the video below.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1280_maks_vanessa_100417.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-10/drew-scott_emma_slater_abc_147784_ejr_2194.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2023-12/GettyImages-1825462653.jpg?h=d4a2cb2c&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1280_maks_vanessa_100417.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/maksim-chmerkovskiy-apologizes-vanessa-lachey-dwts-absence-i-take-full-responsibility-88563", "title": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy Apologizes to Vanessa Lachey For 'DWTS' Absence: 'I Take Full Responsibility'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1280_maks_vanessa_100417.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 37-year-old dancer revealed via Twitter that he's 'looking forward' to dancing in the ballroom next week.", "title": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy Apologizes to Vanessa Lachey For 'DWTS' Absence: 'I Take Full Responsibility'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/maksim-chmerkovskiy-apologizes-vanessa-lachey-dwts-absence-i-take-full-responsibility-88563", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 37-year-old dancer revealed via Twitter that he's 'looking forward' to dancing in the ballroom next week.", "twitter": {"description": "The 37-year-old dancer revealed via Twitter that he's 'looking forward' to dancing in the ballroom next week.", "title": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy Apologizes to Vanessa Lachey For 'DWTS' Absence: 'I Take Full Responsibility'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/maksim-chmerkovskiy-apologizes-vanessa-lachey-dwts-absence-i-take-full-responsibility-88563", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1280_maks_vanessa_100417.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Maksim Chmerkovskiy Apologizes to Vanessa Lachey For 'DWTS' Absence: 'I Take Full Responsibility' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, TV, News, TV, Maksim Chmerkovskiy, Vanessa Lachey, Dancing With The Stars", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
