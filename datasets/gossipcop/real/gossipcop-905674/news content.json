However, the last time the reality star wore a grill \u2013 and posted about it \u2013 was days before she was robbed in Paris.\n\nKardashian West shared a photo of her gold and diamond grill on September 29, 2016, and captioned the photo with three diamond emojis, \u201c\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e\ud83d\udc8e.\u201d\n\nKim Kardashian Instagram\n\nIn the photo, Kardashian West also showed an up-close look at the $4 million ring that was stolen along with two diamond Cartier bracelets, a gold and diamond Jacob necklace, Lorraine Schwartz diamond earrings, a gold Rolex and other items.\n\nOn Oct. 3, four days after the Instagram photo was shared, five men dressed as police entered her room at The No Address Hotel, where they \u201cpushed me on the bed\u201d and \u201ctied me up with plastic cables and taped my hands, then they put tape over my mouth and my legs,\u201d the star said, according to a French police report at the time.\n\nThe thieves took Kardashian West\u2019s two cellphones and approximately $10 million worth of jewelry.\n\nThe $4 million \u201csecond\u201d engagement ring was a gift from her husband, Kanye West, which she debuted at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n\u201cKanye surprised her with a new ring. Kim couldn\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s even more stunning than her engagement ring if that\u2019s possible,\u201d a source told PEOPLE at the time.\n\nThe ring is reported to be close to 20-carats, an upgrade from the 15-carat Lorraine Schwartz engagement ring Kanye famously proposed with at San Francisco\u2019s AT&T Park in 2013.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian West Breaks Down Over Paris Robbery Attack: \u2018That Was So Meant to Happen to Me\u2019\n\nA source recently told PEOPLE that Kardashian West does not keep any expensive possessions in her new Hidden Hills, California, home.\n\n\u201cEver since the Paris robbery, Kim has made many changes in her life. She is much more careful about being flashy,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new year, with a new house and more changes,\u201d the source said. \u201cKim loves her new house. She wants to create the safest, best house for the kids. Along with their security team, Kim and Kanye have made plans to keep intruders out. Their new property is huge and requires even more 24/7 security staff. To keep the house safer, Kim doesn\u2019t want expensive possessions like jewelry at the house.\u201d\n\nThe source continued, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t wear expensive jewelry every day, so it makes no sense to keep it at the house. Kim is trying to eliminate as many concerns as possible. After they bring the new baby home, Kim just wants to enjoy her family.\u201d\n\nKardashian West has previously spoken out about being a \u201cdifferent person\u201d since the incident, and that change extends to keeping her new home with West and their two children, North, 4\u00bd, and Saint, 2, safe.", "images":
