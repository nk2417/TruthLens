Singing it is, however, encouraged from school onwards.\n\nTens of thousands of college football fans attended the match between the University of Georgia and the University of Alabama.", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a883/live/136412a0-ba79-11f0-aa13-0b0479f6f42a.png.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1fd2/live/52ba4db0-ba1b-11f0-ba75-093eca1ac29b.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/9f00/live/7b0ab6c0-ba38-11f0-aa13-0b0479f6f42a.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6d7a/live/9fe3d600-b9ea-11f0-ba75-093eca1ac29b.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/b92e/live/44260d20-c10f-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ca57/live/0b027390-be70-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/e316/live/6bbe3870-be68-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8c49/live/5fad9840-c0f8-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/85a6/live/676e92a0-bb21-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/cef1/live/22775f30-c123-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/a9c5/live/5acda3d0-bc05-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/3351/live/b3625020-ba9a-11f0-aa13-0b0479f6f42a.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/ba5a/live/b03e23f0-c004-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/1df8/live/dcaaf450-ba95-11f0-ba75-093eca1ac29b.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C5E5/production/_99516605_mediaitem99516604.jpg", "https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8938/live/9aeadef0-c0b6-11f0-8669-5560f5c90fbe.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/c240/live/5af48220-bf39-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/13b3/live/ae8f2300-c3f7-11f0-ae46-bd64331f0fd4.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/8432/live/16840330-ba6c-11f0-ba75-093eca1ac29b.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/978b/live/886efc30-bb2e-11f0-aa13-0b0479f6f42a.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/290c/live/b004af20-bfdd-11f0-8456-eff94716b162.jpg.webp"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C5E5/production/_99516605_mediaitem99516604.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42616112", "title": "Did President Trump forget the words to the national anthem?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"title": "Did President Trump forget the words to the national anthem?", "description": "Tens of thousands of college football fans were watching as The Star-Spangled Banner started.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C5E5/production/_99516605_mediaitem99516604.jpg", "alt": "Trump singing the US national anthem"}}, "twitter": {"title": "Did President Trump forget the words to the national anthem?", "description": "Tens of thousands of college football fans were watching as The Star-Spangled Banner started.", "image": {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/C5E5/production/_99516605_mediaitem99516604.jpg", "alt": "Trump singing the US national anthem"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Tens of thousands of college football fans were watching as The Star-Spangled Banner started.", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364147881, app-argument=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42616112", "version": "web-2.33.2-3", "al": {"ios": {"url": "bbcx://news/av/world-us-canada-42616112", "app_store_id": 364147881, "app_name": "BBC: World News & Stories"}, "android": {"url": "bbcx://news/av/world-us-canada-42616112", "app_name": "BBC: World News & Stories", "package": "bbc.mobile.news.ww"}, "web": {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/av/world-us-canada-42616112"}}, "cXenseParse": {"pageclass": "article", "publishtime": "2018-01-09T03:40:53.000Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2018-01-09T03:40:53.000Z"}, "next-head-count": 38}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.bbc.com", "summary": ""}
