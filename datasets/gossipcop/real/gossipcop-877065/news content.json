Shakira does two days a week of interval work on the treadmill, using Kaiser's AKTread system, dance-based interval training three days a week, and then two sessions per week of low-impact sustained cardio, like walking or swimming. \"In the interval training workouts, the focus is spiking her heart rate and recovering quickly, and in the low-impact sustained, the focus is [keeping] her heart rate [steady] for a long period of time,\" explains Kaiser. Both help you build stamina and boost energy!\n\nDouble it up sometimes.\n\nAs you may have noticed, the schedule Kaiser outlined doesn't leave any room for a rest day. But that's actually not how Kaiser structures Shakira's training weeks: \"Two or three times a week we do two workouts a day, which I never do with other clients,\" she says. This leaves room for an off day (gotta do tech rehearsals some time!) while still sticking to the plan. Doubled-up days include the one higher-impact and one lower-impact activity. \"I don't let her skip workouts. We have a very specific goal in mind with heart rate and caloric burn to get her endurance and stamina ready for tour and to get her body at peak performance shape.\"\n\nThe clock is your friend.\n\nA treadmill minute can feel insanely long, but don't be afraid to encourage yourself by using a countdown. Kaiser uses this trick with Shakira all the time. \"I give a very specific amount of time she is reaching for in short bursts,\" says Kaiser. \"It motivates her!\"\n\nDon't forget to stretch!\n\nYes, it takes extra time at the end and, yes, it can be difficult to remind yourself to do it. Even for Shakira! \"It used to be hard to get her to stretch, but now keeping her body safe and injury-free is her first priority,\" says Kaiser. \"She is very diligent about her warm-up and cool-downs.\"\n\nCatch Shakira's El Dorado World Tour starting November 8.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/691f6d4d6e41b33ae16b450f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6908e5edc221e874a37c43e4/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/thegiftshop.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78ac0f20bee472a343e6e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shakira-exclusive-sociak.jpeg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/69023657e01a58c3a15bd9f0/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68ae208769147b8a33071e7e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690a89ef696935a70973f69a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_image.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_640%2Cq_80%2Cw_640/v1509031078/glamour_p-nk-watches-fan-covers-on-youtube.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6913883572a856e01633db57/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68ff927c228cfc84b2391663/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691cc41f8db0739ed1f291ba/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691b6a4e5b8b215c6e72939f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/logo-oneNav.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78a550c5e4e0d3695984c/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/shakira-lede.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691661ad87f42456a221e092/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68fb7acac3ce206321b2ac11/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78ac0f20bee472a343e6e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/shakira-exclusive-sociak.jpeg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78ac0f20bee472a343e6e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shakira-exclusive-sociak.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sara Gaynes Levy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/how-shakira-is-prepping-for-her-el-dorado-world-tour", "title": "The Secrets Behind Shakira's 'El Dorado' World Tour Prep", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Sara Gaynes Levy", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Shakira is working with longtime trainer Anna Kaiser to prep for her upcoming El Dorado World Tour, doing two-a-day workouts and focusing on her endurance so she can perform at her best.", "id": "59f756e65b645f2e900dd9c1", "keywords": "shakira,celebrity fitness,workouts", "news_keywords": "shakira,celebrity fitness,workouts", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59f756e65b645f2e900dd9c1", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Shakira is working with longtime trainer Anna Kaiser to prep for her upcoming El Dorado World Tour, doing two-a-day workouts and focusing on her endurance so she can perform at her best.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78a4a3eead34abcacd6fb/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/shakira-performing-river.jpeg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78a4a3eead34abcacd6fb/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/shakira-performing-river.jpeg\"}", "og": {"description": "She's doing two-a-day workouts to get ready!", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78ac0f20bee472a343e6e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shakira-exclusive-sociak.jpeg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "The Secrets of Shakira's 'El Dorado' World Tour Prep", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/how-shakira-is-prepping-for-her-el-dorado-world-tour"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-11-03T15:14:31.151Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-03T15:14:31.151Z", "author": "Sara Gaynes Levy"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "She's doing two-a-day workouts to get ready!", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78ac0f20bee472a343e6e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shakira-exclusive-sociak.jpeg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "The Secrets of Shakira's 'El Dorado' World Tour Prep"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59f78ac0f20bee472a343e6e/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/shakira-exclusive-sociak.jpeg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509722071.151, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
