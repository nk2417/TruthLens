The flight was heading to Teterboro Airport in New Jersey from Louisville, Kentucky.\"\n\nThe statement added that the FAA \"will investigate\" the incident.\n\nThe Oscar winner left the alarming incident uninjured, her rep confirmed, despite emergency vehicles awaiting the plane as it landed.\n\nABC News aviation expert Col. Steve Ganyard said that if all details prove to be true, this is an \"extremely rare\" incident.\n\n\"Airplanes have two engines because occasionally one fails, but two [engines] are not supposed to fail,\" he said.\n\nGanyard added that without all of the details, it's hard to determine how serious the incident was.\n\n\"But anytime you have both engines on a twin engine airplane stop working, it obviously has the potential for disaster,\" he said.\n\nBecky Perlow contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/bf2f8ed5-a320-4d7e-b583-179abe072d92/trump-signs-shutdown-bill-20251112-ap-jh_1763006747268_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/009e3420-a5ae-477a-aeb3-edfa85648814/johnson-2-gty-jef-251118_1763480583977_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a904a3c1-1e2d-4174-9130-e846e8059dee/carnivaldeath_1762746067738_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY_jennifer-lawrence-cf-161121_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY_jennifer-lawrence-cf-161121_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/b99f9e96-eab3-4778-9eed-25bd727d8e1f/donald-trump-2-gty-gmh-251119_1763557323762_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "https://assets-cdn.abcotvs.net/static/images/DisneyPlus.svg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY_jennifer-lawrence-cf-161121_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/jennifer-lawrence-private-plane-forced-make-emergency-landing/story?id=47968911", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence OK after both engines failed on private plane, rep says", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/jennifer-lawrence-private-plane-forced-make-emergency-landing/story?id=47968911", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence OK after both engines failed on private plane, rep says", "description": "A rep for the actress said she was flying from Louisville, Kentucky.", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY_jennifer-lawrence-cf-161121_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "type": "article"}, "description": "A rep for the actress said she was flying from Louisville, Kentucky.", "keywords": "Jennifer Lawrence, emergency landing, Article, 47968911", "theme-color": "#fff", "copyright": "2025 ABC News", "author": "ABC News", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "Jennifer Lawrence OK after both engines failed on private plane, rep says", "lastPublishedDate": "2017-06-12T00:06:15Z", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,47968911", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,47968911", "googleplay": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/jennifer-lawrence-private-plane-forced-make-emergency-landing/story?id=47968911"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "ABC News", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence OK after both engines failed on private plane, rep says", "description": "A rep for the actress said she was flying from Louisville, Kentucky.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/jennifer-lawrence-private-plane-forced-make-emergency-landing/story?id=47968911", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY_jennifer-lawrence-cf-161121_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "width": 640, "height": 360}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,47968911", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,47968911", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for ipad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/jennifer-lawrence-private-plane-forced-make-emergency-landing/story?id=47968911", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/jennifer-lawrence-private-plane-forced-make-emergency-landing/story?id=47968911"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
