But it sounds like Ross is leaning right into it with her red lipstick look, and straight-up owning that pop of color.\n\nShe might be onto something with the shade of her lipstick, too\u2014the color red has long been associated with confidence, and if that \"you got this\" feeling helps her push a little harder or squeeze in a few more reps, more power to her. (For the record, her lipstick of choice is MAC's matte Ruby Woo.)\n\nAnd while you might've heard that wearing makeup while working out isn't great for your skin, it turns out that lipstick is actually the one product you can safely get away during a sweaty workout. While dermatologists warn that foundations and tinted moisturizers can mix with sweat and clog pores, potentially creating breakouts, and eye makeup can run into your eyes and irritate them, there's no harm in lipstick because your lips don't have sweat glands.\n\nSo if rocking a red lip like Ross helps pump up your workout, have at it. And if not, she's also proven that red lipstick is definitely not required to go all-in, especially when your jam comes on (judging by her enthusiasm here).\n\nInstagram content\n\nRelated:", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/59cbfd003a0eaa152111e889/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/ross.jpg", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self-us/assets/logo-header.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/57e1f1ac431d338e64f83ffa/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/59cbfd003a0eaa152111e889/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/ross.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexa Tucker"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/tracee-ellis-ross-red-lipstick-during-workout", "title": "Tracee Ellis Ross Just Made a Strong Case for Wearing Red Lipstick During a Workout", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Alexa Tucker", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Actress Tracee Ellis Ross said that she wears red lipstick for a major confidence boost when she works out at hotspots like Tracy Anderson Method.", "id": "59cbbef4c99707347a68bcb6", "keywords": "news,tracee ellis ross,tracy anderson,celebrity fitness", "news_keywords": "news,tracee ellis ross,tracy anderson,celebrity fitness", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59cbbef4c99707347a68bcb6", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Actress Tracee Ellis Ross said that she wears red lipstick for a major confidence boost when she works out at hotspots like Tracy Anderson Method.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/59cbfb93c4756a3938c0c4a5/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-849146230.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/59cbfb93c4756a3938c0c4a5/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-849146230.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Get it, girl.", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59cbfd003a0eaa152111e889/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/ross.jpg", "site_name": "SELF", "title": "Tracee Ellis Ross Just Made a Strong Case for Wearing Red Lipstick During a Workout", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.self.com/story/tracee-ellis-ross-red-lipstick-during-workout"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-09-27T19:36:26.787Z", "modified_time": "2017-09-27T19:36:26.787Z", "author": "Alexa Tucker"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SELFmagazine", "description": "Get it, girl.", "domain": "https://www.self.com", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59cbfd003a0eaa152111e889/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/ross.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@SELFmagazine", "title": "Tracee Ellis Ross Just Made a Strong Case for Wearing Red Lipstick During a Workout"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59cbfd003a0eaa152111e889/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/ross.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169640983205651, "pages": 8908243810}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506540986.787, "source": "https://www.self.com", "summary": ""}
