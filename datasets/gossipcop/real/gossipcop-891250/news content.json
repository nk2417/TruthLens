Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive.\n\nWhile Jelena fans have been rooting for them to get back (and stay!) together since their first split in 2012, the group got a little more passionate after seeing the recent posts on Biebs\u2019 now-deleted Instagram page. Over the weekend, Bieber published photos with his rumoured new girlfriend, Sofia Richie, which lead to an attack on her from his fans. As a result of said attack, he threatened to set his account to private if they didn\u2019t ease up on her. Gomez then addressed the controversial post, giving JB some unsolicited advice about appreciating his fans (she\u2019s since regretted commenting, obv). So, what has this all lead to? Bieber allegedly accusing Selena of using him for his fame and then deleting his Instagram, breaking the hearts of Jelena fans everywhere.\n\nKind of hard to follow, right? Luckily, we\u2019ve broken down every single one of their breakups and makeups!\n\nA photo posted by Mr And Mrs Bieber ?

An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it\u2019s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez\u2019s cover on his Snapchat. I think we can all agree that it\u2019s a little odd of Selena to chose to cover her ex\u2019s song after feuding over his new boo Sofia. But hey, you do you, Selena!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20161004211351im_/http://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/sjm-genus/images/misc/snapchat-qr-code.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161004211351im_/http://fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/sjm-genus/images/fashion-logo.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161004211351im_/http://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/sjm-genus/images/logos/logo_st-joseph-cropped.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161004211351im_/http://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-16-at-5.13.23-PM.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20161004211351im_/http://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FM-oct-2016-magazineimage.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161004211351im_/http://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-16-at-5.13.23-PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Date August"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161004211351/http://fashionmagazine.com/culture/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-relationship/", "title": "A complete timeline of Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber\u2019s relationship", "meta_data": {"description": "A photo posted by Selena Gomez (@classyselenagomez) on Aug 16, 2016 at 12:03pm PDT Every relationship has its ups and downs, but when we're talking about J", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "thumbnail": "http://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-16-at-5.13.23-PM-900x600-c-default.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "noodp", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "A complete timeline of Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's relationship", "description": "A photo posted by Selena Gomez (@classyselenagomez) on Aug 16, 2016 at 12:03pm PDT Every relationship has its ups and downs, but when we're talking about J", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161004211351/http://fashionmagazine.com/culture/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-relationship/", "site_name": "FASHION Magazine", "updated_time": "2016-08-25T15:16:29-04:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161004211351im_/http://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-16-at-5.13.23-PM.png", "width": 472, "height": 590}}, "article": {"tag": "Selena Gomez", "section": "Culture", "published_time": "2016-08-16T17:00:04-04:00", "modified_time": "2016-08-25T15:16:29-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "A photo posted by Selena Gomez (@classyselenagomez) on Aug 16, 2016 at 12:03pm PDT Every relationship has its ups and downs, but when we're talking about J", "title": "A complete timeline of Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's relationship", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20161004211351im_/http://cdn.fashionmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-16-at-5.13.23-PM.png"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.6.1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1471381204.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
