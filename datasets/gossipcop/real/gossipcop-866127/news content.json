However, it was heartening to see that Wonder Womanhighest grossing superhero movies has broken into the top 10 of all time.\n\nPatty Jenkins\u2019 film has taken a staggering $368 million, making it the highest-grossing film directed by a woman, while also surpassing Deadpool\u2018s $360 million, nudging it into 11th place in the superhero rankings.\n\nRyan Reynolds, star of Deadpool, marked Wonder Woman overtaking his movie with a classy (and only a little crass) post on Instagram.\n\nThe Merc May Be Filthier, but Her B.O. is Stronger. Congrats #WonderWoman #BoxOfficeBoss A post shared by Ryan Reynolds (@vancityreynolds) on Jul 10, 2017 at 6:08pm PDT\n\nNicely done.", "images":
