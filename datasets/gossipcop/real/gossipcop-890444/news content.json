Even though it's been five months since they broke up, the lyrics in The Weeknd's new EP, My Dear Melancholy, have many fans wondering what exactly went wrong.\n\nThe Weeknd and Selena called it quits in October 2017. While The Weeknd and Selena have never publicly addressed the reason for their split, according to People, long distance played a factor. \"She and Abel have been going back and forth for a few months about their relationship,\" a source told the publication at the time. \"It's been hard with him being on tour and her shooting in New York. That wasn't easy on them.\" Even though Selena \"always made an effort\" to join him on tour, \"that played a part in them getting distant. It's over for now, but they're still in touch.\"", "images": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/TRRzqy5inZiEesSTWYaxgk3u5iE=/fit-in/792x548/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2018/03/30/835/n/1922398/tmp_wSeXYn_30ba9edf29288ed5_main.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/TYCeaVDurN8RFIZ8-m2RikdK4R8=/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2018/03/30/757/n/1922283/04f655335abe6fb1d98fe8.23693979_.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/QPny3xF6o1wXf0F4TtCDTZaBMLk=/fit-in/3651x1907/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2018/03/30/835/n/1922398/c3201b935abe89eaed1038.48897711_.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/QPny3xF6o1wXf0F4TtCDTZaBMLk=/fit-in/3651x1907/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2018/03/30/835/n/1922398/c3201b935abe89eaed1038.48897711_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Monica Sisavat Sol\u00eds", "Updated On April", "At Am"], "canonical_link": "https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/why-did-selena-gomez-weeknd-break-up-44711569", "title": "Was Justin Bieber to Blame For Selena Gomez and The Weeknd's Split?
