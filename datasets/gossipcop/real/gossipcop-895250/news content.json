Now, the singer is down 70 pounds. But, more importantly, she's in tip-top health and is totally fit to dance her way through the international \"State of the World\" tour, which began in September and hits 56 cities. So, how did the new mom get into such great shape? Think weights \u2014 lots of weights.\n\nJackson's trainer, Paulette Sybliss, recently filled E! in on her star client's workout routine. Some six weeks after giving birth, Jackson embarked on a \"very vigorous\" training schedule that saw her hitting the gym at least four times a week, and working out for 45 minutes to an hour each time.\n\n\n\nAt first, Jackson's priority was to shed that baby weight. But, Sybliss also worked with the singer to develop lean muscles. After all, strength and stamina do come in handy when you're dancing your way across the planet! To kick things off, Sybliss developed a routine that incorporated back-to-back exercises with weights.\n\nRelated\n\n\"You would look at [Janet] and think she'd done like an hour of cardio with me \u2014 but when you're working with weights and you're working the muscle that way, it elevates the heart rate, but also it's creating that fat-burning effect both during the session and also when she left me, and that was key,\" the trainer explained.\n\nNow that she's on the road and not looking to lose any more weight, Jackson's routine includes plenty of rest. \"I need to keep her fit and healthy to complete the tour. So it changes as in we're not having to work as intensely. We're having to work smart,\" Sybliss said. \"We make sure that she rests, she doesn't get injured, and she can finish this tour. And thank God she's looking great. There have been no illnesses \u2026 and that was my goal.\"\n\nWhen it comes to nutrition, Sybliss believes that moderation is key. As long as her client is eating healthfully 90 percent of the time, the trainer says that a little bite of chocolate cake here and there is harmless. \"You're not eating it every day. You won't get fat overnight,\" she reasons.\n\nWe love this fintess guru's level-headed, health-first approach to fitness. And, Jackson's beautifully fit frame is proof that her technique really works.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2024/05/million-dollar-listing-season-15-josh-altman-heather-altman-01.jpg?itok=sVWprKet", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/WickedxBravo_LOGO%20%281%29_new.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2024/04/shop-bravocon-merch.jpg?itok=oT3veOb0", "http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/icons/youtube-social.min.svg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/11/lookbook-janet-jackson-weight-loss-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/icons/facebook-social.min.svg", "http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/icons/twitter-x-social.min.svg", "http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/icons/snapchat-social.min.svg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/11/lookbook-janet-jackson-weight-loss-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/1_1_medium/public/2025/10/01_wkd2_500x500_web_art_pl_f01_102725.jpg?itok=lWnW6oK6", "http://www.bravotv.com/modules/custom/ls_stripe/components/gated-slate/img/heartlock.svg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/fp_scale_crop_190x190/public/2024/11/amanda-batula-kyle-cooke.jpg?itok=VhaZtI4U", "http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/icons/instagram-social.min.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/11/lookbook-janet-jackson-weight-loss-promote.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/blogs/janet-jackson-lost-70-pounds-and-her-workout-regime-is-surprisingly-reasonable", "title": "How Janet Jackson Lost 70 Pounds After Giving Birth", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1130002, "parsely-section": "The Daily Dish Blog Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"Here's How Janet Jackson Lost 70 Pounds\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"The Daily Dish\"},\"field_microsite\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1075801\",\"site_section\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/11\\/lookbook-janet-jackson-weight-loss-promote.jpg?itok=Mkj3vIDr\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/11\\/lookbook-janet-jackson-weight-loss-promote.jpg?itok=VX-JdhSo\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/11\\/lookbook-janet-jackson-weight-loss-promote.jpg?itok=8U9zCOX3\",\"70x70\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/fp_scale_crop_70x70\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/11\\/lookbook-janet-jackson-weight-loss-promote.jpg?itok=GtpdDqrv\"}}", "description": "After giving birth to her son Eissa Al Mana in January, Janet Jackson worked hard to shed the weight she'd put on during her pregnancy.
