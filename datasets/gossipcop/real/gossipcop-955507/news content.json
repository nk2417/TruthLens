During a Thursday matinee performance of his play \u201cKiller Joe\u201d on London\u2019s West End, the actor stopped the show twice to tell an audience member to put away her iPad.\n\nLondon theater critic Mark Shenton tweeted an \u201ceye-witness account\u201d from the play, documenting Bloom\u2019s unscripted outbursts, in which he threatened to stall the show if the iPad remained in sight.\n\n\u201cI need you to put [that] iPad away now!\u201d Shenton quoted Bloom as saying, before reportedly adding minutes later, \u201cPut that f\u2014ing iPad away now and I will wait.\u201d\n\nEye-witness account from today\u2019s matinee of @KillerJoePlay: #OrlandoBloom made two unscripted interventions: \u201cI need YOU to put iPad AWAY NOW!\u201d Then again a few mins later: \u201cPUT that fucking IPad away now and I will wait\u201d. pic.twitter.com/WZ4ybgKexJ \u2014 Mark Shenton \ud83d\udc99 (@ShentonStage) July 26, 2018\n\nAnother audience member, actor Harry Edwin, replied to Shenton\u2019s tweet to defend the iPad owner, behind whom he was sitting during the incident. According to Edwin, the woman in question was using the iPad \u201cfor her fan\u201d in the hot theater.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cI was sat behind and although it would have looked bad, in her defense she was only using it for her fan as the auditorium was roasting!\u201d Edwin wrote, posting a photo from behind the woman\u2019s row that pictured a miniature fan propped up on an iPad with a blank screen.\n\nI was sat behind and although it would have looked bad, in her defence she was only using it for her fan as the auditorium was roasting! #preshowpic pic.twitter.com/TAwSWLRT4b \u2014 Harry Edwin (@harryedwinactor) July 26, 2018\n\n\u201cThere was an incident at yesterday\u2019s matinee of \u2018Killer Joe\u2019 that was dealt with swiftly and efficiently by the Front of House team,\u201d a spokesperson for the theater told multiple outlets. \u201c The Trafalgar Studios is a very intimate performance space, which can make the use of electronic devices by any audience member extremely distracting for the Company. The Trafalgar Studios\u2019 team [does] a great job of making sure everyone at the Theatre can enjoy the live experience.\u201d\n\n", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bloom.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bloom.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christi Carras", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/legit/news/orlando-bloom-stops-play-killer-joe-ipad-1202888393/", "title": "Orlando Bloom Stops Play Twice After Seeing Audience Member With iPad", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "During his play \"Killer Joe\" on the West End, Orlando Bloom stopped the show twice to tell an audience member to put away her iPad.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Christi Carras", "tags": "Killer Joe, Orlando Bloom, West End", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Orlando Bloom Stops Play Twice After Seeing Audience Member With iPad", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/legit/news/orlando-bloom-stops-play-killer-joe-ipad-1202888393/", "description": "During his play \"Killer Joe\" on the West End, Orlando Bloom stopped the show twice to tell an audience member to put away her iPad.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bloom.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Orlando Bloom"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-27T18:43:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-27T18:43:55+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "During his play \"Killer Joe\" on the West End, Orlando Bloom stopped the show twice to tell an audience member to put away her iPad.", "site": "@variety", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Orlando Bloom Stops Play Twice After Seeing Audience Member With iPad", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bloom.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532717035.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
