We\u2019re just very different, we\u2019re very different. And we were very young and new.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to learn \u2014 women have to learn how to support each other,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s not taught to each other in the playground.\u201d\n\nWhen Cohen asked if Pink had attempted to make an argument into a physical fight, the pop star revealed, \u201cActually, she swung at me in a club. Hilarious!\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018What\u2019s happening right now? What\u2019s happening?'\u201d she said.\n\nKevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nThe two signers allegedly clashed when they recorded the track \u201cLady Marmalade\u201d \u2014 reportedly over who would sing the highest notes in the song.\n\nAlthough they didn\u2019t get along in their youth, Pink insisted she and Aguilera are now fine.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so talented and deep down I\u2019ve had bad days, too,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s a really sweet person. We made up on The Voice. I mean, it was funny, I laughed. I hadn\u2019t seen her in years and years and years.\u201d\n\nAs for how they managed to get over their differences, the \u201cWhat About Us\u201d singer simply said, \u201cWe became moms. We grew up. We hugged it out. It\u2019s that simple. I feel so good about that.\u201d\n\nWhile she may have made up with Aguilera, the singer is not backing down from comments made against Kim Kardashian West when the reality star posed a nude bathroom selfie last year.\n\nPink shared a message on Twitter that seemingly took aim at Kardashian West for using her sexuality to get attention instead of her \u201cbrains,\u201d \u201cstrength,\u201d or \u201cwork ethic.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Why Pink Regrets Saying She\u2019s Team Taylor Swift\n\nShe told Cohen on Thursday night that she didn\u2019t regret throwing shade at the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star.\n\n\u201cHonestly, she went in on Bette Midler,\u201d Pink said, referring to Kardashians tweet slamming Midler for the Tony Award winner\u2019s criticism over her NSFW selfie.\n\n\u201cIf you go in on Bette Midler, you\u2019re probably gonna hear from me,\u201d the pop star added. \u201cYou just don\u2019t talk to Bette Midler\u2026 about anything.\u201d", "images":
