The hip-hop performer pitched the concept of going on a world tour with three powerhouses in the music industry: Beyonce, Bruno Mars and, get this, Rihanna.\n\n\u2014 Mathew Knowles says Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange\u2019s light complexions helped their music careers \u2014\n\n\u201cJust thinking\u2026.
