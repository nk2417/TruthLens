Striegel spent six months in prison in 2010 after pleading guilty to risk of injury to a child and enticing a minor by computer.\n\nHe was accused of attempting to lure a 14-year-old girl into a sexual relationship.\n\nStriegel's scenes from The Predator were removed, following pressure from Munn on Warner Bros bosses, and she claimed following the decision, director Shane Black - who had been a friend of Striegel - 'has not spoken to her since'.\n\nThe victim of the actor has since publicly thanked Olivia for 'standing up for her'.\n\nShe tweeted: 'I am also eternally grateful for Olivia Munn\u2019s action. She spoke up for me. She took a stance for me. In turn she stood for all who have suffered like I have.\n\nDisgraced: Munn accused director Brett Ratner of sexual harassment following an incident that occurred on set of After the Sunset in 2004\n\nSupporting women: Olivia also fought to have actor Striegel removed from movie The Predator after discovering he was a registered sex offender\n\n'To be acknowledged by a stranger, on a public platform about this issue is incredibly empowering. The positive feedback from social media towards Olivia Munn is uplifting and feels incredibly supportive for me personally.\n\n'I have no shame for what was done to me. I am not the one who needs to carry that shame. My name is Paige Carnes, former Jane Doe. I hope anyone who has suffered like I have regains their voice and their humanity.'\n\nOlivia replied telling the girl she had been an 'inspiration' and thanked her for her 'courage' and 'fearlessness'.\n\nIt hadn't been the first time Olivia had taken a stance, as she previously accused director Brett Ratner of sexual harassment following an incident that occurred on set of After the Sunset in 2004.\n\nHitting back: Olivia told Cosmopolitan: 'People want to think that women use their sexuality to get ahead in any business, not just Hollywood. There\u2019s that unfair stigma'\n\nShe recalled how Ratner had masturbated in front of her when she was asked to deliver food to his trailer - penning about her experience in her 2010 book.\n\nThe director was faced with six allegations of sexual harassment and assault in November last year from different actresses. Ratner has denied all allegations against him and made a decision to step away from Warner Bros.\n\nSpeaking out publicly about the director, Olivia admits in her interview with Cosmopolitan that she was advised not to go up against Ratner, as she was told 'his power trumped hers'.\n\nFollowing her allegations against him, Ratner claimed he had 'banged her three times' in a TV interview and branded Olivia 'bitter' as he claimed the duo 'used to date'.\n\nMunn furiously denied his claims publicly on Twitter.\n\nFighting for her name: Olivia was forced to fight back following her claims against Ratner, as he appeared on TV and alleged he'd 'banged her three times' - something she strongly denies\n\nStanding up for herself: She took to Twitter to hit back at the disgraced director, telling Cosmo:'All I wanted was for him to clear my name. He muddied it and I wanted him to clear it' - Ratner later retracted his comments and confirmed they were not true\n\n'He was doing this at a time when men were allowed to say that,' she says.\n\n'People want to think that women use their sexuality to get ahead in any business, not just Hollywood. There\u2019s that unfair stigma... All I wanted was for him to clear my name. He muddied it and I wanted him to clear it.\n\n'I wasn\u2019t looking for him to never work again, because back then it wasn\u2019t even an option. I\u2019d worked so hard and all I wanted was my name. So I went on to Twitter and I handled it in the only way I could. It was going to be a moral victory for me in that at least I\u2019d stood up for myself.'\n\nRatner then backpedaled on his claims telling Howard Stern that he was just friends with the actress and apologised for making her look like 'a whore'.\n\nRatner continued to work on films in the wake of the claims, with Munn speaking out once more against the director last year and claiming there has been 'no justice'. She said she had been left pessimistic about Hollywood's will to root out sexual misconduct, as a result.\n\nMunn said: 'There was always that feeling of, \"Do I have worth to the public, or to Hollywood?\" If I wanted to keep going, it felt like I had to bury it and just be OK with everything.'\n\nIn April this year, Warner Bros confirmed they will not be renewing their 450 million dollar deal with Ratner.\n\nThe studio\u2019s deal with Ratner\u2019s RatPac-Dune Entertainment financing company expired with the US release of Dwayne Johnson film, Rampage.\n\nOlivia Munn's full interview appears in the December 2018 issue of Cosmopolitan, on sale Wednesday.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/19/12/104005979-0-image-m-6_1763553771266.jpg",
