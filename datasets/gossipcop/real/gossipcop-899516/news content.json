Its cast is younger (Jax Taylor excluded), poorer, and less scripted. In Season 7 of the Bravo series, the premise is that the Vanderpump Rules kids are finally growing up.\n\nWell, they are and they aren\u2019t! Despite getting older, they maintain the emotional development of hyena cubs. With arguably only one exception (the angel-cum-martyr Brittany), they are a cast of villains who only occasionally reveal their ability to understand and display empathy.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to track who exactly is the true villain of Vanderpump Rules. It may seem like it has to be Jax\u2014but he\u2019s allegedly turning things around, putting all those Season 6 reiki sessions to good use. So who replaces him? Well, we\u2019re keeping track: Every week, we\u2019ll gather and rank each episode\u2019s most villainous moments (and one moment of redemption), which will help determine who, exactly, is The Worst come season\u2019s end. And now, Week 1!\n\n3. Jax proves he\u2019s still a blowhard.\n\nThe opening scene of Season 7 reveals the atonement of Jax Taylor. Season 6 started with the revelation that Jax cheated on his girlfriend Brittany (a \u201c----ing sweetheart, you dumb-ass motherf---er!\u201d), and continued with his repeatedly terrible treatment of her. There was even a story line surrounding a recording of Jax admitting he would never marry Brittany. Suffice it to say that the season did not end on a hopeful note for the two.\n\nBut Monday\u2019s premiere finds him in their apartment, making her a mayonnaise-soaked turkey sandwich. Then, mere moments after delivering her sandwich, which she is presumably about to eat, he \u2026 farts. She pleads with him not to. He does anyway. Audibly. Loudly.\n\nLater, en route to proposing to Brittany, he admits he \u201chas to go no. 2.\u201d Two steps forward, one step back, etcetera.\n\n2. Billie Lee sasses Lala.\n\nWe were introduced last season to Billie Lee, a transgender woman who quickly became a cast and fan favorite. But Season 7 opens with a sassy Billie Lee, who immediately chastises former friend Lala for being distracted by her phone. (Which everyone on the show is, all the time, constantly.) Rude!\n\nIs Billie Lee a sleeper candidate for season villain?! Twist!\n\n1. James \u201craps\u201d in front of Brittany.\n\nJames Kennedy, Vanderpump Rules\u2019 resident Brit, is a relatively divisive character. He initially strolled into our lives in Season 4 as a romantic foil for Jax (they were competing for the affections of Lala, a short-lived interest for both). Since then, Kennedy has become something of a pathetic antihero; in one breath, he\u2019ll issue a cutting personal insult, and in the next, he\u2019ll sob about disappointing his parents.\n\nThis season, he appears to be leaning further into his shithead persona. To kick things off, he decides to publicly rap about Jax\u2019s former infidelity, in front of Brittany and the entire restaurant.\n\nThis man consistently confuses hostility for swagger. He\u2019s a front-runner for season villain.\n\nPlus: This week\u2019s moment of redemption \u2014 Lala\n\nIn the season opener, Lala talks about her father\u2019s recent passing. She\u2019s vulnerable and honest, also admitting that though she wasn\u2019t an easy child, her father was always kind.\n\nLala did not originally endear herself to viewers: She was cocky without being clever, cruel without any charm. But over time, she\u2019s become one of the most reasonable people on the show, often holding herself and her castmates accountable. Might she be this season\u2019s heroine?", "images": ["https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F11%2Ffart.gif&w=3840&q=75&dpl=406f3adf64ea2410894205e03accb4e416ca97a7", "https://wp.theringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cropped-NUP_183989_0050.jpg", "https://www.theringer.com/avatar-dark.svg", "https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2018%2F12%2FNUP_183989_0050.jpg&w=3840&q=75&dpl=406f3adf64ea2410894205e03accb4e416ca97a7", "https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F11%2Flala.gif&w=3840&q=75&dpl=406f3adf64ea2410894205e03accb4e416ca97a7", "https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F11%2Fdj.gif&w=3840&q=75&dpl=406f3adf64ea2410894205e03accb4e416ca97a7", "https://www.theringer.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwp.theringer.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2024%2F11%2Fphones.gif&w=3840&q=75&dpl=406f3adf64ea2410894205e03accb4e416ca97a7"], "top_img": "https://wp.theringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cropped-NUP_183989_0050.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.theringer.com/2018/12/04/tv/vanderpump-rules-season-7-premiere-recap-episode-1", "title": "The Most Villainous Moments From the \u2018Vanderpump Rules\u2019 Season 7 Premiere, Ranked", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "Jax Taylor may be the reigning antagonist of the Bravo reality series, but the new season brings challengers to his throne", "og": {"title": "The Most Villainous Moments From the \u2018Vanderpump Rules\u2019 Season 7 Premiere, Ranked", "description": "Jax Taylor may be the reigning antagonist of the Bravo reality series, but the new season brings challengers to his throne", "image": "https://wp.theringer.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/cropped-NUP_183989_0050.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "next-head-count": 11}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543899600.0, "source": "https://www.theringer.com", "summary": ""}
