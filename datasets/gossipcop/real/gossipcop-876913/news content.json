Backgrid)\n\nBotched doctors enacted a historical procedure as they used leeches to improve blood flow around actress Tawny Kitaen\u2019s nipple during a boob job.\n\nThe American actress appeared opposite Terry Dubrow and Paul Nassif on the Botched season finale, sought help after undergoing six boob augmentations.\n\nInsisting she wanted to get off the \u2018boob train\u2019, Dr Dubrow and Dr Nassif performed a procedure to remove her implants, using leeches to to improve blood flow around the nipple area.\n\nWe hope you\u2019ve eaten your dinner (Picture: E! Backgrid)\n\nSpeaking about why she decided to have implants, Tawny said: \u2018It must have been something inside myself when I wasn\u2019t feeling secure enough about myself.\n\n\u2018I thought this will take care of the problem.\u2019\n\nDr Paul Nassif said: \u2018I can\u2019t imagine the pressures that Tawny must have been feeling at the height of her career.\n\n\u2018Maybe getting a little enhancement can keep her at that top a little longer, but I\u2019ve got to tell you, it\u2019s a scalpel not a magic wand.\u2019\n\nKitaen became renowned after starring in a number of music videos for band Whitesnake, including singles Here I Go Again, Still Of The Night and Is This Love.\n\nArrow MORE: Woman admits to having 13 surgeries in a year to look like \u2018role model\u2019 Ivanka
