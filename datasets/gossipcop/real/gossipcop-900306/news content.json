As a chef, she was excited to meet one of the most revered figures in the restaurant industry. When they started talking, she recalls, she realized that he\u2019d been drinking and he became what she characterized as \u201ccreepy\u201d \u2014 \u201cjust giving me this provocative, icky feeling.\u201d\n\nMinutes into their conversation, she recalls, he told her, \u201cCome work for me, I\u2019ll pay you double what you\u2019re making.\u201d Moments later, someone bumped her glass, spilling wine all over her chest and down her scooped-neck shirt. She alleges that Batali began rubbing her breasts with his bare hands while saying something like, \u201cLet me help you with that,\u201d as he groped her chest. \u201cHe just went to town, and I was so shocked,\u201d the chef says. \u201cJaw on the ground, I just stepped back from him in utter disgust and walked away.\u201d\n\nThe chef is one of four women who allege that Batali touched them inappropriately in a pattern of behavior that appears to span at least two decades. Three of the women worked for Batali in some capacity during their careers. One former employee alleges that over the course of two years, he repeatedly grabbed her from behind and held her tightly against his body. Another former employee alleges that he groped her and that, in a separate incident, he compelled her to straddle him; another alleges that he grabbed her breasts at a party, though she no longer worked for him at the time. The woman whose allegations are described above has never worked for Batali, though she works in the restaurant industry.\n\nBatali was reprimanded for inappropriate behavior in the workplace as recently as two months ago. According to a spokesperson for Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group \u2014 the restaurant-management services company that provides support to around 24 restaurants owned by, among others, Batali and Joe Bastianich \u2014 in October 2017, a B&B restaurant employee officially reported inappropriate behavior by Batali to the company. It was the first formal complaint about Batali, who was reprimanded and required to undergo training, according to the company.\n\nIn a statement to Eater, Batali said that he is stepping away from the day-to-day operations of his businesses for an unspecified period of time. ABC, where Batali has co-hosted the daytime show The Chew since 2011, has also asked the chef to step away from the show \u201cwhile we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nBatali did not deny all the allegations, saying that they \u201cmatch up\u201d with ways he has behaved.\n\n\u201cI apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt. Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family.\n\n\u201cI have work to do to try to regain the trust of those I have hurt and disappointed. For this reason, I am going to step away from day-to-day operations of my businesses. We built these restaurants so that our guests could have fun and indulge, but I took that too far in my own behavior. I won\u2019t make that mistake again. I want any place I am associated with to feel comfortable and safe for the people who work or dine there.\n\n\u201dI know my actions have disappointed many people. The successes I have enjoyed are owned by everyone on my team. The failures are mine alone. To the people who have been at my side during this time \u2014 my family, my partners, my employees, my friends, my fans \u2014 I am grateful for your support and hopeful that I can regain your respect and trust. I will spend the next period of time trying to do that.\u201d\n\nBatali remains an owner of his individual restaurants, according to the B&B spokesperson. In a statement to Eater, B&B said that while the company has had sexual harassment training and policies for more than 10 years, it will now also enlist an independent, outside corporate investigations firm for any staffers wishing to make claims against owners of the restaurants.\n\n\u201cWe take these allegations very seriously. We pride ourselves on being a workplace for our employees where they can grow and deliver great service with equal opportunity and free from any discrimination. We have strong policies and practices in place that address sexual harassment. We train employees in these policies and we enforce them, up to and including termination,\u201d B&B\u2019s statement reads in part. \u201cMr. Batali and we have agreed that he will step away from the company\u2019s operations, including the restaurants, and has already done so.\u201d\n\nJoe Bastianich said in a statement, \u201cRight now, I\u2019m just focused on ensuring that our more than 1,000 employees continue to have a safe and positive work environment.\u201d An ABC spokesperson said in a statement, \u201cABC takes matters like this very seriously as we are committed to a safe work environment. While we are unaware of any type of inappropriate behavior involving him and anyone affiliated with the show, we will swiftly address any alleged violations of our standards of conduct.\u201d\n\nAlthough B&B has been sued for sexual harassment before, Batali\u2019s own alleged inappropriate sexual misconduct has not previously been the subject of a lawsuit. Each of the women who spoke to Eater asked to remain anonymous in part for fear of retaliation \u2014 Batali, a celebrated and powerful chef, holds enormous sway in the restaurant world and beyond. Eater is granting them anonymity but has corroborated their stories with friends, family members, or colleagues who were informed of the incidents, as well as with publicly available information.\n\nMany of the people who spoke with Eater said they were afraid of retribution for speaking out. A woman who claims she was inappropriately touched while she worked for Batali in the late \u201990s told Eater, \u201cHe has clear intent on being threatening when he is wronged. And the level of vindictiveness is very chilling. So, it never occurred to me to share tales out of school.\u201d\n\nThe multiple accusations of inappropriate touching and other misconduct emerged from an Eater investigation that included interviews with dozens of industry professionals who have had interactions with the chef, including nearly three dozen current and former Batali employees.\n\nBatali, who became a star as the host of one of Food Network\u2019s first hit TV shows, Molto Mario, has risen to the very top of the restaurant industry since starting out in a New Jersey sandwich shop in the early \u201980s as a college student. Along with Joe Bastianich and Lidia Bastianich, he is the force behind Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group, which notably includes the New York City restaurants Del Posto and Babbo, each of which holds one Michelin star. Five years ago, B&B reported more than $250 million in annual revenue. Batali is also a minority shareholder in the Italian-market chain Eataly USA, which has six locations across the country.\n\nOutside of his restaurants, Batali is the author of numerous cookbooks, the face of nationally distributed jarred pasta sauces and other kitchen products, and the jolly, orange-Crocs-wearing co-host of ABC\u2019s daytime talk and cooking show The Chew. He also founded a child education and empowerment nonprofit and is active in (RED), the nonprofit founded by celebrities Bono and Bobby Shriver. Additionally, Batali owns a small percentage of Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield\u2019s landmark gastropub, The Spotted Pig. People Eater spoke to within the industry often describe him as a friendly, charming, professional, supportive, and frequently generous person.\n\nBut his affable persona belies another, more crude reputation, according to dozens of interviews. Batali\u2019s lewdness, his crass way of speaking about women, and his focus on women\u2019s bodies have been well known within certain circles in the restaurant world, according to people who spoke with Eater.\n\nA former server at P\u00f3, the now-shuttered West Village restaurant where Batali built his reputation throughout the \u201990s, alleges that repeated physical harassment took place while Batali was the chef.\n\nSteve Crane, who co-owned P\u00f3 with Batali until the chef decamped to start his future empire, confirmed that he was told by multiple staff members of ongoing inappropriate behavior by Batali. Though Crane does not recall any specific details, and was not in the kitchen to personally witness the incidents, he said that he was told by several female staffers that Batali had grabbed them from behind, consistently made a variety of sexual comments, and engaged in behavior like snapping bra straps. \u201cI made it very clear to him that he needed to stop, but I feel ashamed that this happened at P\u00f3, and my staff endured this behavior,\u201d he said. Crane said that because they were partners in the restaurant, he ultimately did not have the power to fire Batali. (Batali, through a spokesperson, denied that Crane ever confronted him.)\n\nThe former server alleges that on multiple occasions Batali grabbed her from behind \u201clike a linebacker, like a disgusting bear hug,\u201d and pressed her body against his. In hours of interviews with Eater, she described nearly two years of inappropriate behavior. The grabbing would often occur while they were alone in a cramped passageway between the dining room and the kitchen, she alleged. \u201cHe would breathe on me \u2014 and sometimes take a deep inhale, like he was smelling me,\u201d she recalled.\n\nWhen Crane asked Batali to stop, Batali would become more aggressive, the server alleged; some female staff eventually started asking Crane to not confront Batali with their complaints, she added. (Crane confirmed that after some women would complain, they would ask him not to confront Batali because he would only be more aggressive toward them.)\n\nRestaurant culture in the \u201990s was generally known for being \u201cbawdy,\u201d and sexual relationships between staff weren\u2019t uncommon, the former server said, but Batali\u2019s behavior was more about degradation than good humor, she alleges: \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just some dirty jokes, this was mean, this was about asserting power. He is awful.\u201d\n\nLee McGrath, a chef who joined P\u00f3 a few years after Batali left as chef, told Eater that when he was hired, Crane warned him, \u201cDon\u2019t even think about messing with the waitresses \u2014 they\u2019ve been through hell with Mario.\u201d\n\nA different woman, who worked for Batali in the late \u201990s, alleges that he touched her inappropriately on two different occasions. The first incident allegedly took place soon after she started her job. One day, while she was in the dining room of the restaurant, she said, Batali came up behind her, catching her unaware, and \u201cput his hand on half of my butt and he squeezed it.\u201d She recalled later gently confronting Batali, who responded, \u201cWhat are you, a lesbian?\u201d\n\nIn a second incident that took place about three years later, she alleges that while working next to Batali in a small, boxed-in space, he was seated in such a way that he blocked her exit. When she had to get up, he refused to move \u2014 leaving her no choice but to straddle him in order to leave the space. According to the woman, she told Batali that she needed to go to the bathroom. Batali, who was reclining with his legs propped up, allegedly told her, \u201cIf you want to get up, you\u2019re going to have to climb over me.\u201d When she returned, he was still seated with his legs propped up, again refusing to move; she had to straddle him a second time, she alleges. \u201cIt was disappointing, again, to have that happen. And, again, humiliating,\u201d she said.\n\nYet another woman who worked for Batali for about a year in the late aughts alleges that he lunged at her and grabbed her breasts during an industry party in 2011, a few years after she stopped working for him. At the party, she recalled that Batali appeared drunk, and she became concerned for his safety when she spotted him on a balcony standing slumped over. \u201cWhen I noticed that he looked wobbly, my instinct was concern,\u201d she said. When she walked over and tapped him on the shoulder, \u201che sprung up, like he was startled,\u201d and with his eyes wide open. Then, immediately, \u201che lifted his arms straight up and grabbed both of my breasts,\u201d she said. \u201cI took a step back and I pushed him away, and when I did that, I remember he said, \u2018Oh, come on.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that moment I realized, \u2018I\u2019m just a body [to him],\u2019\u201d she said of the experience. Though at the time, she no longer worked for Batali, she had worked for him a few years prior and said she believed they shared some mutual respect. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve seen him over the years, I don\u2019t have a sense that he even remembers,\u201d she said, though she added, \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him about it.\u201d\n\nThe chef who alleged being groped at an industry party in New Orleans about 10 years ago, as described earlier, said she remains appalled by his behavior. \u201cHe gets wasted, he\u2019s arrogant, and he acts like he\u2019s God\u2019s gift to women,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is still your industry, you\u2019re a leader in this industry \u2014 if you behave this way, what kind of example are you setting?\u201d\n\nIn addition to the allegations of improper physical contact, several sources said that Batali has a reputation for inappropriately using sexual innuendo in workplace conversation. Multiple people who work at or have worked at Batali restaurants from the early \u201990s to now described behavior that ranges from mild creepiness to more severe misconduct, both in interviews with Eater and in publicly available documents.\n\nThe woman who was allegedly groped by Batali on the balcony told Eater, \u201cI remember not being fully surprised that it happened because I\u2019d seen him drunk and flirtatious with women. And that flirting came in the form of talking and sitting really close. I\u2019d never witnessed anything during work hours; it was always post-work.\u201d\n\nBut according to other interviews, his inappropriate behavior happened at work, too. McGrath, the P\u00f3 chef who started about a year after Batali left, said that he eventually understood why he was given the warning to not harass the female waitstaff, as two servers, including one who spoke with Eater, began to relay accounts of Batali\u2019s misconduct. \u201cIt\u2019s like they had PTSD,\u201d he said. McGrath remembers being told that there was a lot of \u201chugging from behind\u201d and that Batali would ask about their sex lives, what color underwear they wore, and other inappropriate questions.\n\nAnother former female P\u00f3 staffer, who worked at the restaurant earlier than the woman mentioned above, said that Batali could be generally \u201cnasty\u201d and a \u201cbully\u201d to both men and women. He was \u201cconstantly making overtly sexual and inappropriate\u201d comments, she alleges. Though she doesn\u2019t remember physical touching, she said that she\u2019s never worked for someone more inappropriate than Batali. At one point, she wanted to take out an ad in the paper to say what \u201can awful person he was\u201d because she thought it was unfair that he was getting so many accolades considering how terribly he treated people, she said. \u201cMario is smart and he\u2019s talented, but I don\u2019t think that gives you the right to be disgusting,\u201d she said.\n\nThe employee who Batali allegedly groped shortly after she was hired said that she has witnessed \u201ca lot of gray-area affection with women,\u201d like \u201ca lot of subliminal dissection of women\u2019s bodies, telling women their asses looked good, remarking on boobs.\u201d\n\nThe chef\u2019s boorish side has also been previously documented in the media. In the 2006 book Heat, the writer Bill Buford provides a glimpse at the earlier years of Babbo and Batali\u2019s tenure on the Food Network, noting crass behavior with two female prep chefs, as well as an assistant and a set manager. In one incident detailed in the book, during a food- and wine-filled evening at Batali\u2019s Greenwich Village trattoria Lupa Osteria Romana, Buford writes that Batali said to a female server: \u201cIt\u2019s not fair I have this view all to myself when you bend over. For dessert, would you take off your blouse for the others?\u201d\n\nA manager at a B&B restaurant said that while he loves working for Batali \u2014 who has been good to the kitchen staff and very professional with both male and female chefs, in his experience \u2014 he has seen Batali treat women outside of the kitchen crudely, especially while intoxicated. Eater granted him anonymity, as he is still employed by the company and fears losing his job. \u201cI really like the guy, and every sober interaction has been very professional, but, yeah, he\u2019s gross,\u201d the manager said.\n\n\u201cHe was always friendly, but it was in this \u2018Oh, you\u2019re a pretty little girl\u2019 kind of way,\u201d Gabriela Acero, a former maitre d\u2019 and floor manager who worked at Batali\u2019s Greenwich Village restaurant Otto from 2012 to 2014, said. \u201cI remember him complimenting my dress, saying something like \u2018Oh, don\u2019t you look like the blossoming bosom of spring.\u2019 Even then I was like, \u2018Oh, Jesus.\u2019\u201d\n\nBatali\u2019s reputation has left some of the women who\u2019d benefited from his power and influence with mixed feelings about their relationship with him. He\u2019s championed the careers of numerous women; his kitchen at Del Posto is led by a female executive chef and executive pastry chef. (\u201cIt\u2019s not because they have a vagina,\u201d he said of the crew while at the Fast Company Innovation Festival in October. \u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re the smartest people for the job.\u201d)\n\n\u201cI feel very complicated feelings toward him,\u201d the former employee who described two encounters with Batali said. \u201cIn some ways, he was very supportive and he used his power and influence to connect me.\u201d\n\nThe former employee who alleged having her breasts grabbed described working for Batali as frequently professional. \u201cI definitely felt way more reverential about him then than I do now,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think it says so much about how we just accept and move on, and I think for a long time, I just thought, \u2018Well, he didn\u2019t rape me,\u2019\u201d said the woman who alleged being grabbed at an industry party in 2011. \u201cBut I remember it vividly, it impacted me, and I feel uneasy recalling it. I just feel this major sense that I\u2019m not the only one. I feel really grateful for the cultural reckoning that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nAnyone with information about alleged misconduct in the restaurant world can contact Eater at tips@eater.com or via
