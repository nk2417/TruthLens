For her efforts to help the victims' families after the tragedy, the 24-year-old singer was made an honorary citizen of Manchester last July.\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-09/1280_ariana_grande_gettyimages-692508022.jpg?h=9ed075e7&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-12/ariana_grande_gettyimages_692493986.jpg?h=d5fe1936&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/gettyimages-922456262.jpg?h=be38bc70", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/gettyimages-922456262.jpg?h=be38bc70&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/gettyimages-922456262.jpg?h=be38bc70", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/liam-gallagher-steps-in-for-ariana-grande-with-manchester-tribute-at-2018-brit-awards-96837", "title": "Liam Gallagher Steps In for Ariana Grande With Manchester Tribute at 2018 BRIT Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/gettyimages-922456262.jpg?h=be38bc70", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "A source told ET on Wednesday that Grande was forced to pull out of the show due to health reasons.", "title": "Liam Gallagher Steps In for Ariana Grande With Manchester Tribute at 2018 BRIT Awards", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/liam-gallagher-steps-in-for-ariana-grande-with-manchester-tribute-at-2018-brit-awards-96837", "type": "Article"}, "description": "A source told ET on Wednesday that Grande was forced to pull out of the show due to health reasons.", "twitter": {"description": "A source told ET on Wednesday that Grande was forced to pull out of the show due to health reasons.", "title": "Liam Gallagher Steps In for Ariana Grande With Manchester Tribute at 2018 BRIT Awards", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/liam-gallagher-steps-in-for-ariana-grande-with-manchester-tribute-at-2018-brit-awards-96837", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/gettyimages-922456262.jpg?h=be38bc70", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Liam Gallagher Steps In for Ariana Grande With Manchester Tribute at 2018 BRIT Awards | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, Awards, Music, News, Ariana Grande", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
