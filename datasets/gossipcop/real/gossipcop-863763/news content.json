And on a given day, Serena could beat some players. I believe because she\u2019s so incredibly strong mentally that she could overcome some situations where players would choke \u2019cause she\u2019s been in it so many times, so many situations at Wimbledon, The U.S. Open, etc. But if she had to just play the circuit \u2013 the men\u2019s circuit \u2013 that would be an entirely different story.\u201d\n\nMcEnroe\u2019s controversial comments led to a flurry of angry reactions from tennis fans, and an irritated Wiliams even weighed in.\n\n\u201cDear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based,\u201d the 23-time grand slam champ tweeted. \u201cI\u2019ve never played anyone ranked \u2018there\u2019 nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I\u2019m trying to have a baby. Good day sir.\u201d\n\nDear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based. \u2014 Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) June 26, 2017\n\nEditor\u2019s picks\n\nI\u2019ve never played anyone ranked \u201cthere\u201d nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I\u2019m trying to have a baby. Good day sir \u2014 Serena Williams (@serenawilliams) June 26, 2017\n\nMcEnroe further fanned the flames Sunday when he refused to apologize for his remarks, only saying on This Morning that he didn\u2019t mean to upset the pregnant athlete. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to go wrong with Serena because she\u2019s pregnant,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to upset her or whatever it was. She\u2019s \u2013 I think she was doing a tongue-in-cheek as well.\u201d\n\nTrending Stories Kevin Spacey Says He Has 'No Home' After Sexual Misconduct Allegations Brandi Carlile and Patty Loveless Pay Tribute to Vince Gill at 2025 CMA Awards 2025 CMA Awards: The Complete Winners List Neighbor Indicted in Murder of \u2018King of the Hill\u2019 Star Jonathan Joss\n\nTalking with Colbert, McEnroe may have dug himself further into a hole by reiterating that he didn\u2019t feel it was \u201cnecessary\u201d to apologize to Williams, and even joking that perhaps it would be best for him to challenge Williams to a match during her pregnancy.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s pregnant, so maybe I should play her now \u2013 I\u2019d have a better chance,\u201d McEnroe said, soliciting a mixed reaction from the audience. \u201cBut, either way, I wish her the absolute best. She\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s happened to American tennis in the last 10 to 15 years.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-john-mcenroe-77a246aa-270f-4b5c-9543-4f45b726055b.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-john-mcenroe-77a246aa-270f-4b5c-9543-4f45b726055b.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-sports/john-mcenroe-my-girls-dont-think-i-can-beat-serena-williams-201788/", "title": "John McEnroe: \u2018My Girls Don\u2019t Think I Can Beat\u2019 Serena Williams", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Legendary tennis champ John McEnroe says daughters were angered by his NPR remarks", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Joyce Chen", "tags": "Serena Williams", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "John McEnroe: 'My Girls Don't Think I Can Beat' Serena Williams", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-sports/john-mcenroe-my-girls-dont-think-i-can-beat-serena-williams-201788/", "description": "Legendary tennis champ John McEnroe says daughters were angered by his NPR remarks", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-john-mcenroe-77a246aa-270f-4b5c-9543-4f45b726055b.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1", "width": 1500, "height": 900, "alt": "john mcenroe, john mcenroe serena williams, serena williams, serena williams john mcenroe tennis, john mcenroe npr, serena williams pregnant, serena williams best player, serena williams champion, serena williams women's tennis, john mcenroe controversy"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-28T15:35:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T15:11:34+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Legendary tennis champ John McEnroe says daughters were angered by his NPR remarks", "site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "John McEnroe: \u2018My Girls Don\u2019t Think I Can Beat\u2019 Serena Williams", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-john-mcenroe-77a246aa-270f-4b5c-9543-4f45b726055b.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498664100.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
