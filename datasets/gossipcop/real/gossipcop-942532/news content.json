In that interview, he said he had no interest in ending the show or retiring.\n\n\u201cI gave up on that. I\u2019ve tried. I just think I\u2019m just too nervous, neurotic, driven,\u201d he told PEOPLE. \u201cI would have had a different answer a few years ago. I might have deluded myself into thinking that I\u2019d be happy in a hammock or gardening. But no, I\u2019m quite sure I can\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019m going to pretty much die in the saddle.\u201d\n\nBourdain also told PEOPLE he was \u201chappy in ways that I have not been in memory\u201d and \u201chappy in ways I didn\u2019t think I ever would be, for sure.\u201d\n\nAs Bourdain had done in many interviews in the past, he spoke about his past demons, including his addiction to heroin and cocaine, and his use of alcohol. At the end of his days in the restaurant industry, he was \u201cdefinitely drinking too much\u201d because of the stress and the free alcohol.\n\n\u201cWhen there\u2019s something that I like\u2026 films or books or a particular author, I do pursue them with more zeal than perhaps a lot of other people,\u201d Bourdain said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s addictive, habitual or whatever.\u201d\n\nBourdain also made sure he spent at least five days a month with Ariane, who lives in New York with Busia.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go back, see my daughter, unpack, repack, mimic a normal life, which is extraordinarily pleasurable to me,\u201d he told PEOPLE.\n\nBourdain was found dead Friday morning from an apparent suicide in a hotel in France, where he was filming a new episode of Parts Unknown. He was 61.\n\nIf you or someone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/zach-bryan.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-lainey-wilson-devlin-hodges-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/the-real-housewives-of-orange-county-logo-1.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel S.
