Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.\n\nAt such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.\n\nThe Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/16/18/whittaker-skyline.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/16/18/whittaker-skyline.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/doctor-who-new-jodie-whittaker-female-bbc-complaints-response-woman-time-lord-peter-capaldi-a7849391.html", "title": "Doctor Who: BBC responds to complaints made about Jodie Whittaker's casting", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/tv/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "'The Doctor is an alien from the planet Gallifrey\u00a0and can switch gender'", "og": {"updated_time": "2017-07-19T15:12:21.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "The BBC's sassy response to complaints made about Jodie Whittaker casting as Doctor Who", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/tv/news/doctor-who-new-jodie-whittaker-female-bbc-complaints-response-woman-time-lord-peter-capaldi-a7849391.html", "type": "article", "description": "'The Doctor is an alien from the planet Gallifrey\u00a0and can switch gender'", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/16/18/whittaker-skyline.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/16/18/whittaker-skyline.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-19T15:12:21.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-07-19T15:12:21.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "TV & Radio", "author_name": "Jacob Stolworthy", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 464, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 1, "external_link_count": 5}, "date": "2017-07-19T15:12:21.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176299319"}, "twitter": {"title": "The BBC's sassy response to complaints made about Jodie Whittaker casting as Doctor Who", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "'The Doctor is an alien from the planet Gallifrey\u00a0and can switch gender'", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/16/18/whittaker-skyline.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Doctor Who\",\"Jodie Whittaker\",\"BBC\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500477141.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
