Kelly Rowland didn\u2019t hold back with vivid descriptions of her post-baby body in her new book, Whoa, Baby! \u2014 and she made sure to cover some very sensitive topics.\n\n\u201cAll that gnawing at your nipples will take its toll! In those early days, I was fascinated (my polite way of saying \u2018horrified\u2019) by the transformation of my boobs,\u201d the 36-year-old singer wrote. \u201cMy nipples were HUGE \u2014 we are talking the size of Frisbees \u2014 and sometimes I could see these veins bulging out while I was nursing.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Post-Baby Bodies: Hottest Before-and-After Pictures Check out before and after photos of Kate Middleton, Kim Kardashian, Halle Berry and other stars' hottest post-baby bodies\n\nIn her book, Rowland details many of her own experiences to help new parents navigate the tricky territory of parenthood. (She and her husband, Tim Weatherspoon, welcomed their son Titan Jewell back in 2014.)\n\nRelated: Kelly Rowland\u2019s Ab Workout The \"Motivation\" singer puts meaning to that exact word with these tummy-toning moves from her trainer\n\n\u201cMy boobs themselves were so long and stretchy that I sometimes felt like I could\u2019ve swung them over my shoulders,\u201d the former Destiny\u2019s Child singer continued. Rowland added that despite her previous breast augmentation, the size and shape of her breasts still changed drastically from breastfeeding.\n\n\u201cEven with the silicon action, it was like some of the air had been sucked out and they just sort of hung there like flapjacks,\u201d she said, noting, \u201cI can\u2019t speak for everyone, but I know I\u2019m going to see someone (wink, wink) after I have my second kid. In the meantime, I just tried to enjoy my ability to feed my baby!\u201d\n\nIn a recent interview with USA Today, Rowland also tackled another body part that changed dramatically following Titan\u2019s birth: her vagina.\n\nRelated: Incredible Post-Baby Bodies! See how these new moms shaped up after giving birth\n\n\u201cYour vajayjay does not look the same for a very long time,\u201d she told the publication, adding that a friend told her not to worry about how her nether regions looked. \u201cBut, I care about it. We got to get it all done up and trimmed and waxed and this and that and it\u2019s all swollen and crazy and you\u2019re just wondering, what just happened?\u201d", "images":
