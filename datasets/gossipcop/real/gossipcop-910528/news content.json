According to the New York Post, the Marchesa designer and estranged wife of Harvey Weinstein has decided to forgo her planned runway show on February 14 in favor of a digital presentation.\n\n\u201cGeorgina couldn\u2019t go through with it. She was too scared,\u201d a source told The Post. \u201cThey were gung ho . . . but as they got closer, she choked.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a little over three months since Chapman announced her separation from Weinstein in the wake of dozens of women coming forward with allegations of his sexual abuse. Shortly after the scandal erupted, reports surfaced of Marchesa employees leaving the company, as well as the brand\u2019s collaboration with Helzberg Diamonds being put on hold indefinitely.\n\n\u201cMy heart breaks for all the women who have suffered tremendous pain because of these unforgivable actions,\u201d Chapman said in a statement in October. \u201cI have chosen to leave my husband. Caring for my young children is my first priority and I ask the media for privacy at this time.\u201d\n\nAs for the upcoming presentation, the brand has little to say. A spokesperson for Marchesa told The Post, \u201cMarchesa is looking forward to presenting their Fall \u201918 collection in an updated format this season.\u201d", "images":
