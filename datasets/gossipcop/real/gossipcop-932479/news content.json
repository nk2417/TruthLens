There's some things that y'all might not wanna do, but it got to get done. I just can't do what you want me to do. I just can't.

And a man should praise the queen. But you know, my way of praising is called, 'How was dinner?', 'You like the house you living in? You like all them clothes you getting? I'm taking care of your family, I'm taking care of my family\u2026' You know, I'm putting in the work.\"\n\nNow Wood, who plays Dolores in HBO's sci-fi hit, has joined the conversation on Twitter.\n\nRelated Story Westworld season 3 \u2013 Everything you need to know\n\nThe actress, who came out as bisexual six years ago, responded to Khaled by telling him: \"You're seriously missing out man.
