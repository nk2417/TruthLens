But today, Kensington Palace announced that the happy couple won't be jetting out of town immediately following their big day. Rather, they are delaying their trip to get back to work.\n\nMeghan and Harry will attend an engagement in the week following their wedding, and then they'll head off to an undisclosed location.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe couple will be going on honeymoon, but not straightaway,\u201d Kensington Palace spokesman Jason Knauf said, according to People \u201cThey will have their first engagement as a married couple in the week after the wedding.\u201d\n\nThat schedule is in keeping with what Markle said earlier this year about wanting to \"hit the ground running,\" once she officially becomes a member of the royal family.\n\nTheir plan is also similar to when Prince William and Duchess Kate went on their honeymoon. According to royal commentator Victoria Arbiter, \"William and Kate left for their honeymoon in the Seychelles 10 days after their wedding. Before that the couple were in Anglesey as William was working at his RAF search and rescue base.\"\n\nThus far, it has not been confirmed where Prince Harry and Markle plan to honeymoon, though Travel + Leisure reported that the couple plans to visit Namibia.\n\nKensington Palace has yet to comment on that news.", "images":
