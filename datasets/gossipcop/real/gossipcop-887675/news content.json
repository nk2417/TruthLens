{"url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/18/the-flash", "text": "Verdict\n\nThe Flash is certainly living up to the promise of being a lighter, funnier series in Season 4. \"Mixed Signals\" did a good job of capturing the humor and energy of the show's early days while throwing in a little romantic tension for good measure. However, there's very little tension driving the series at the moment. The Flash may be lighter, but it's also becoming a more shallow and straightforward series.", "images": ["https://images.justwatch.com/icon/169478387/s100", "https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/10/17/flash-4-1600-1508284042505.jpg", "https://images.justwatch.com/icon/338253243/s100", "https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/10/17/flash-4-1280-1508284059491_160w.jpg?width=1280&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://images.justwatch.com/icon/322380782/s100", "https://oyster.ignimgs.com/social/avatars/users2/68/779169-1348098486.jpg?crop=1%3A1&width=36&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80"], "top_img": "https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/10/17/flash-4-1280-1508284059491_160w.jpg?width=1280&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/18/the-flash", "title": "The Flash: \"Mixed Signals\" Review", "meta_data": {"vertical": "Legacy", "category": "Review", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover", "theme-color": "#BF1313", "description": "The Flash continues to shift in a more lighthearted direction as Barry and Iris attend couples therapy.", "robots": "noodp, noydir, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/18/the-flash", "title": "The Flash: \"Mixed Signals\" Review - IGN", "type": "article", "image": "https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/10/17/flash-4-1280-1508284059491_160w.jpg?width=1280&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80", "description": "The Flash continues to shift in a more lighthearted direction as Barry and Iris attend couples therapy.", "site_name": "IGN"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=284819997", "article": {"tag": "Legacy", "author": "Jesse Schedeen", "published_time": "2017-10-18T01:00:32.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-17T23:47:52.461Z"}, "cXenseParse": {"keywords": "The Flash,Review,TV,Legacy,IGN,Comics,Episode,TV Review,Mixed Signals"}, "section": "article", "thumbnail": "https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/10/17/flash-4-1280-1508284059491_160w.jpg?width=1280&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80", "al": {"ios": {"url": "ign://ign.com/articles/2017/10/18/the-flash", "app_store_id": 284819997, "app_name": "IGN: Video Game News, Reviews, Guides"}, "android": {"url": "ign://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/18/the-flash", "app_name": "IGN", "package": "com.mobile.ign"}, "web": {"url": "https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/18/the-flash"}}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "IGN: Video Game News, Reviews, Guides", "ipad": "IGN: Video Game News, Reviews, Guides", "googleplay": "IGN"}, "id": {"iphone": 284819997, "ipad": 284819997, "googleplay": "com.mobile.ign"}, "url": {"iphone": "ign://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/18/the-flash", "ipad": "ign://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/18/the-flash", "googleplay": "ign://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/18/the-flash"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IGN", "imageUrl": "https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/10/17/flash-4-1280-1508284059491_160w.jpg?width=1280&format=jpg&auto=webp&quality=80"}, "facebook-domain-verification": "960w7qsbsscw9stu2hxr2xfaes6cvc", "next-head-count": 59, "copyright": "IGN Entertainment, Inc.", "referrer": "always", "cpid": "5a8bca0b2d985966302b4671c3a001ee", "fb": {"app_id": 115982828429116, "pages": 59685491632}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508299200.0, "source": "https://www.ign.com", "summary": ""}
