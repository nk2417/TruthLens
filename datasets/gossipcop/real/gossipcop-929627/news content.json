I remember, before she was born, thinking about her features and if she\u2019d have hair. I was born bald. So the first thing my mama said as I pushed her out was, \u2018Look at her hair.\u2019 What a moment we all had in the delivery room. I\u2019m just so honored to be her mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeeing my daughter for the first time was so overwhelming,\u201d Pierre adds. \u201cWatching Shawniece push her out drew me to tears. Watching her birth has to be the best moment of my young life. It\u2019s incredible to think she\u2019s all ours.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?
