If I keep winning,\" Williams replied, laughing.\n\nWhile Markle may not have been in the stands during the first day of the tournament, the 36-year-old sports star was cheered on by her devoted husband, with whom she welcomed her first child, daughter Alexis Olympia, in September.\n\nWilliams also fielded questions about returning to Wimbledon for the first time since becoming a mother, which she admitted she hadn't really thought about.\n\n\"It felt good to play and just to be back on the grass,\" she shared. It definitely felt good.\"\n\nShe also said that she's \"adjusting well\" to returning to the sport, because she's making sure to be present in her daughter's life, including waking up early before her big matches to spend time quality time together.\n\n\"I spend so much time with her, every single day. We literally do everything,\" she shared. \"So I really don't like being away from her, but I also think it's healthy, in a way, for me to do what I need to do and be that working mom, and then go back home and be the mom.\"\n\nWilliams also fielded a question about whether or not she'd spoken with the umpire before her match about what surname she'd prefer to be addressed by, now that she's married, and if she'd even noticed that they'd called her \"Mrs. Williams.\"\n\n\"You know, it still doesn't register that I'm married, actually, which is crazy,\" said Williams, who tied the knot with Ohanian in November 2017, a month after they welcomed their little girl. \"So much has happened in the past 12 months. So, I clearly didn't think about it.\"\n\nAs for getting a visit from the Duchess of Sussex, it would only be fair as Williams and her husband took time out of their busy schedules to attend her wedding to Prince Harry back in May.\n\nCheck out the video below for more on Williams' time at the star-studded royal wedding.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/serena_williams_meghan_markle_inset_gettyimages.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/serena_williams_meghan_markle_inset_gettyimages.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-11/serena_williams_gettyimages_873800966.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-06/serena_williams_gettyimages-951288946_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-07/emma_watson_gettyimages-998521670.jpg?h=28fe4125&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/serena_williams_meghan_markle_inset_gettyimages.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/serena-williams-on-whether-meghan-markle-will-come-see-her-wimbledon-matches-105408", "title": "Serena Williams On Whether Meghan Markle Will Come See Her Wimbledon Matches", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/serena_williams_meghan_markle_inset_gettyimages.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The tennis star also opened up about returning to Wimbledon for the first time since becoming a mother last year.", "title": "Serena Williams On Whether Meghan Markle Will Come See Her Wimbledon Matches", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/serena-williams-on-whether-meghan-markle-will-come-see-her-wimbledon-matches-105408", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The tennis star also opened up about returning to Wimbledon for the first time since becoming a mother last year.", "twitter": {"description": "The tennis star also opened up about returning to Wimbledon for the first time since becoming a mother last year.", "title": "Serena Williams On Whether Meghan Markle Will Come See Her Wimbledon Matches", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/serena-williams-on-whether-meghan-markle-will-come-see-her-wimbledon-matches-105408", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-07/serena_williams_meghan_markle_inset_gettyimages.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Serena Williams On Whether Meghan Markle Will Come See Her Wimbledon Matches | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Serena Williams, Meghan Markle, Wimbledon, Alexis Ohanian", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
