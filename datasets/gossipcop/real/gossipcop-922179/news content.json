In an interview with Stephen Colbert Tuesday, the two-time Oscar winner updated fans on her father\u2019s health, sharing that he\u2019s doing well after undergoing a lung transplant.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s great, thank you for asking,\u201d she told the late-night host. \u201cIt\u2019s the hardest surgery a person can undergo, and I thank all the people who make themselves a donor, it saves lives.\u201d\n\nSwank explained that doctors had \u201cgiven him a short time to live\u201d if he didn\u2019t get the surgery. Now, though, \u201che\u2019s alive and thriving and well. I took three years off to be with him and help him through that life journey.\u201d\n\nSwank first revealed the news about her father\u2019s condition back in 2015, announcing her acting hiatus shortly after his surgery.\n\n\u201cMy dad is living with me,\u201d she told HuffPost Live. \u201cI\u2019m his sole caretaker now.\u201d\n\nThough there were certain job opportunities that she had to pass on, making the choice to care for her father was an easy one, said Swank. \u201cThere is nothing I want to do more other than being with my dad in this time of need. And if it wasn\u2019t me taking care of him, I think I would always look back and regret that opportunity to be able to take care of him and help him through this extraordinary time.\u201d And even when she was taking time away from the screen, Swank kept busy; she launched an athleisure line called Mission Statement in the fall of 2016.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69138dc2108d96082627c8f5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6912302be09f2aa2f0d4b6ab/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d5c439028ff3af11a1b13/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-492438964.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691776873a7a9caa6e2a4ea9/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab2644fafb7596b1f1a0176/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/Olivia-FX-Feud-Battle.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6902272ce593df117190f65c/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d5c423c0f45451fecd62d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-3264763.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a8dfc8e3c0f45451fecd3b8/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/Nell-Scovell-Late-Night-Boys-Club-Lede.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68f7c5fd2c439c9cf1a90cba/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab27e0caf40c861bd5030ed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Hilary-Swank.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690b869d6a6b7d01f3052591/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690cd8954962ddec3a078f19/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62fe7af0987db7065a9e93f4/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68ffa350ac05a478f30a0772/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d5c429028ff3af11a1b11/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-141568033.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fa85c33a9313623cb7b252/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab25872d81411654dbdb691/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/Late-Night-Mocks-Trump-Putin-Call.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab27e0caf40c861bd5030ed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Hilary-Swank.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Yohana Desta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/hilary-swank-acting-hiatus-three-years-father-lung-transplant", "title": "Why Hilary Swank Took Three Years Off from Hollywood", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Yohana Desta", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "The actress is slowly getting back into the business after taking some time to care for her ailing father.", "id": "5ab266fcb15b4b643f115abf", "keywords": "hillary swank,stephen colbert,trust,fx,danny boyle", "news_keywords": "hillary swank,stephen colbert,trust,fx,danny boyle", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5ab266fcb15b4b643f115abf", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The actress is slowly getting back into the business after taking some time to care for her ailing father.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab27e0caf40c861bd5030ed/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/tout-Hilary-Swank.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab27e0caf40c861bd5030ed/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/tout-Hilary-Swank.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The actress is slowly getting back into the business after taking some time to care for her ailing father.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab27e0caf40c861bd5030ed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Hilary-Swank.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Why Hilary Swank Took Three Years Off from Hollywood", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/03/hilary-swank-acting-hiatus-three-years-father-lung-transplant"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-03-21T15:46:14.136Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-21T15:46:14.136Z", "author": "Yohana Desta"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The actress is slowly getting back into the business after taking some time to care for her ailing father.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab27e0caf40c861bd5030ed/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-Hilary-Swank.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Why Hilary Swank Took Three Years Off from Hollywood"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ab27e0caf40c861bd5030ed/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/tout-Hilary-Swank.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google": "nopagereadaloud", "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521647174.136, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
