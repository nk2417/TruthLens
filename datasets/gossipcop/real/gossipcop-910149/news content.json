I'm telling you, I'd win Survivor.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Nicole's husband Keith Urban previously said he doesn't want his wife to be \"tough\".\n\nNicole shared: \"Well, Keith always says to me, 'You stay raw and sensitive, and I'll buffer things for you', which is a beautiful offering. He is always told, 'You're so tough.' And he says, 'That's not what I want for you, Nicole. You don't need to get a thick skin.'\n\n\"I think, for me, it's about having a place that's safe to nurture you, where the tears can be shed. That way I can actually go back open and curious and willing. And at times scarred and a little damaged, but not with a sword like, 'I'm seeking revenge.' Because that just doesn't interest me. I actually never choose films that are about revenge. I choose films, I've realised, about women who somehow find their way through.\"\n\nNicole has always been a \"sensitive\" person and has always spent a lot of time dwelling on her feelings.\n\nShe added: \"My mother said I was always an intense child, a very sensitive child. So that probably helped the emotions to be very present. I was just a big thinker. I would evaluate and analyse and feel and cry and discuss and be angry. All of those emotions were very surface for me.\"\n\nBang Showbiz", "images": ["https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/2f43b1b72642878d76733e7eec02616ef8d256e8/1000/jpeg", "https://www.iol.co.za/_next/static/media/iol.2d0c9660.svg", "https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/2f43b1b72642878d76733e7eec02616ef8d256e8=w700", "https://www.iol.co.za/_next/static/media/iol.f8693d09.svg"], "top_img": "https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/2f43b1b72642878d76733e7eec02616ef8d256e8/1000/jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://iol.co.za/entertainment/celebrity-news/2018-02-01-nicole-kidman-reveals-creepy-secret-i-eat-bugs/", "title": "Nicole Kidman reveals creepy secret: 'I eat bugs'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "The star says she devours hornworms, \"fruity\" mealworms, \"exquisite\" grasshoppers and crickets, which she likens to a \"hairy nut\".", "article": {"publisher": "https://iol.co.za", "published_time": 1517475600000, "author": "Bang Showbiz", "section": "Entertainment"}, "IE=edge": "X-UA-Compatible", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msvalidate.01": "4BE9A236252D15311B31D1EA103EE632", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=479535200", "fb": {"app_id": 293175074032541}, "google-site-verification": "iQCzO2whcLNU6_F3xi1Dck7JMALz7869mBLTQf08wJo", "facebook-domain-verification": "m85xaz5xdy8fiifyys11g0z5i7e2b0", "og": {"title": "Nicole Kidman reveals creepy secret: 'I eat bugs'", "description": "The star says she devours hornworms, \"fruity\" mealworms, \"exquisite\" grasshoppers and crickets, which she likens to a \"hairy nut\".", "url": "https://iol.co.za/entertainment/celebrity-news/2018-02-01-nicole-kidman-reveals-creepy-secret-i-eat-bugs/", "site_name": "IOL", "locale": "en-ZA", "image": {"identifier": "https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/2f43b1b72642878d76733e7eec02616ef8d256e8/1000/jpeg", "width": 1000}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IOL", "creator": "@IOL", "title": "Nicole Kidman reveals creepy secret: 'I eat bugs'", "description": "The star says she devours hornworms, \"fruity\" mealworms, \"exquisite\" grasshoppers and crickets, which she likens to a \"hairy nut\".", "image": {"identifier": "https://iol-prod.appspot.com/image/2f43b1b72642878d76733e7eec02616ef8d256e8/1000/jpeg", "width": 1000}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.iol.co.za", "summary": ""}
