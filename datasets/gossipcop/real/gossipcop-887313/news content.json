I dress modestly. I don\u2019t act flirtatiously with men as a policy.\u201d\n\nShe immediately followed that statement, at the center of the controversy, with, \u201cWomen should be able to wear whatever they want. They should be able to flirt however they want with whomever they want. Why are we the ones who have to police our behavior?\u201d", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mayim-bialik.jpg?w=1000&h=667&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mayim-bialik.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mayim-bialik.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Otterson", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/mayim-bialik-new-york-times-op-ed-backlash-harvey-weinstein-1202590950/", "title": "Mayim Bialik Responds to Backlash Over Harvey Weinstein Op-Ed", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"Big Bang Theory\" star Mayim Bialik has responded to backlash she received for a New York Times op-ed about Harvey Weinstein.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Joe Otterson", "tags": "Harvey Weinstein, Mayim Bialik", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Mayim Bialik Responds to Backlash Over Harvey Weinstein Op-Ed", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/mayim-bialik-new-york-times-op-ed-backlash-harvey-weinstein-1202590950/", "description": "\"Big Bang Theory\" star Mayim Bialik has responded to backlash she received for a New York Times op-ed about Harvey Weinstein.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mayim-bialik.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Mayim Bialik"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-16T17:41:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-16T17:41:16+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Big Bang Theory\" star Mayim Bialik has responded to backlash she received for a New York Times op-ed about Harvey Weinstein.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@joeotterson", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mayim Bialik Responds to Backlash Over Harvey Weinstein Op-Ed", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/mayim-bialik.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508175676.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
