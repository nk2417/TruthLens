There is very little hidden meaning to it; it\u2019s basically a straightforward saga of rich people being weird.\n\nThis explainer is your break from all the terrible things that are happening in the world. Sit back and learn the details of a bizarre tale of weird rich people being petty and weird and rich to each other. The important news will be waiting when you\u2019re done.\n\nWho is Azealia Banks?\n\nBanks\u2019s history of dramatic grudges sometimes leads to glib suggestions that she consider medication, a pattern Banks reacts against strongly. \u201cThey joke and prod at you and say you need a doctor yet have no idea about the type of uncontrollable chaos that goes on inside your head,\u201d she wrote on Facebook last year. \u201cOn top of arrogantly suggesting you need to be medicated, these people Have no idea how gnarly psych-drugs are.\u201d\n\nWho is Elon Musk?\n\nElon Musk is the founder and CEO of Tesla, the tech company/possible Ponzi scheme that makes electric cars for rich people, and the founder and CEO of SpaceX, which wants to colonize Mars. He periodically makes the news for announcing a tech scheme that sounds vaguely like one of Lex Luthor\u2019s plans to defeat Superman. He recently made headlines for claiming that he could save the children who were trapped in a Thai cave with a miniature submarine (he did not save the children), and then calling one of his critics a \u201cpedo guy\u201d (the guy was not a pedo). Musk is currently in the news for sending Wall Street reeling by tweeting about taking Tesla private.\n\nMusk has spent much of the past year fighting against attempts to unionize at the Tesla Factory. His first wife, Justine Musk, wrote a long and damning article about their marriage and divorce in 2010, in which she said that Musk had \u201crendered her disposable\u201d over the course of their time together. Reportedly, Musk used to tell her that if she were his employee, he would fire her.\n\nBanks and Musk\u2019s paths unite through the person of Grimes, who has been collaborating with Banks and who announced at this year\u2019s Met Gala that she and Musk are dating.\n\nWho is Grimes?\n\nGrimes, real name Claire Boucher, is a pop star who prior to her relationship with Elon Musk was known mostly for being a punky, spacey weirdo who once sailed a houseboat down the Mississippi River. She used to have the descriptor \u201canti-imperialist\u201d in her Twitter bio, which meant that hearts were broken when she announced during this year\u2019s Met Gala that she\u2019s dating Elon \u201cUnion Buster\u201d Musk. (Grimes claimed on Twitter, incorrectly, that Musk \u201chas never prevented [his employees] from unionizing.\u201d)\n\nThere are certain overlaps between Musk\u2019s and Grimes\u2019s personal aesthetics, however, that make their coupledom feel more logical than it might seem. She loves space; he wants to colonize space. They met because they both tweeted the same joke punning on rococo and the thought experiment Roko\u2019s basilisk. They are in many ways the same kind of pretentious nerd.\n\nSo what\u2019s the scandal?\n\nWe know that Grimes and Banks were planning to collaborate on Banks\u2019s long-delayed, notoriously troubled second album, a fact both confirmed separately in June. According to Banks, Grimes invited her to fly out to LA to stay at Musk\u2019s place to put the finishing touches on their collaboration, which Banks duly did.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets weird.\n\nOn Sunday, Banks began posting a now-deleted Instagram story, saying that she had been sitting alone in Musk\u2019s house, waiting for Grimes, \u201cfor days.\u201d\n\nDid Grimes actually invite Banks over and then ghost on her? Did Banks just show up out of the blue? No one knows!\n\nBut Banks continued to post about her stay on Instagram. Her thoughts were not flattering, and she may have lowkey accused Elon Musk of some investment fraud.\n\n\u201cI waited around all weekend while grimes coddled her boyfriend for being too stupid to know not to go on twitter on acid,\u201d Banks wrote, concluding that \u201cit was probably some weird threesome sex shit to begin with.\u201d\n\nAccording to Banks, the investment issue was a major topic of concern at the Musk residence while she was there. \u201cI saw him in the kitchen tucking his tail in between his legs scrounging for investors to cover his ass after that tweet,\u201d she said in an interview with Business Insider, during which she also clarified that she was at Musk\u2019s home from early on Friday through Sunday night. \u201cHe was stressed and red in the face.\u201d She added, \u201cHe\u2019s not cute at all in person.\u201d\n\nGrimes has yet to comment on the story. Musk, however, has maintained that he does not know Banks, telling Gizmodo that he \u201chas never even met [Banks] or communicated with her in any way.\u201d A spokesperson for Tesla added that Banks\u2019s claims were \u201ccomplete nonsense.\u201d\n\nSo what is the truth?\n\nWe can be reasonably sure that Banks really was at Musk\u2019s house over the weekend. Business Insider has \u201can independent secondary source\u201d who confirmed she was there, and while Musk has continued to maintain that he has never met or interacted with Banks, he also has not denied that she stayed at one of his properties. We don\u2019t know, however, that Musk was definitely in the same house Banks was in on the weekend in question.\n\nAs for the rest of the story \u2014 whether Banks really was invited over for a working weekend only to find her collaborator soothing her boyfriend over his decision to accidentally commit light investment fraud while tweeting on acid \u2014 at this point, it\u2019s pretty much Banks\u2019s word against Musk\u2019s.\n\nAnd when it comes to the question of whether to believe the woman who told Sarah Palin to get gang-raped over something Palin never said, or the guy who accused an innocent man of being a pedophile after the man pointed out that Musk\u2019s miniature submarine did not, in fact, save a bunch of children \u2014 well, gentle reader, only your heart knows the truth on that one.", "images": ["https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-18-at-1.47.24%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=10.37037037037%2C0%2C79.259259259259%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-108986758.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=15.65%2C0%2C68.7%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/author_profile_images/11909/profile_pic.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=96", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-2220822378-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/GettyImages-140443597.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12162375/481892586.jpg.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C1.4283925888833%2C100%2C78.652009427754&w=1200", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/TradHusbands_10-31_IsabelSeliger.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/GettyImages-140443597.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-18-at-1.47.24%E2%80%AFPM.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C7.9439252336449%2C100%2C84.11214953271&w=2400", "https://www.google-analytics.com/g/collect?v=2&tid=G-C3QZPB4GVE&cid=555&en=noscript_page_view", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-108986758.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C1.4798641436196%2C100%2C97.040271712761&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-2220822378-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/GettyImages-170887182.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=15.628683693517%2C0%2C68.742632612967%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/GettyImages-170887182.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C1.5099552253025%2C100%2C96.980089549395&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12162375/481892586.jpg.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0.075000000000003%2C0%2C99.85%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/TradHusbands_10-31_IsabelSeliger.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400"], "top_img": "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12162375/481892586.jpg.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C1.4283925888833%2C100%2C78.652009427754&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Constance Grady"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/2018/8/16/17692700/azealia-banks-elon-musk-grimes-explained", "title": "The billionaire house hostage saga of Azealia Banks, Elon Musk, and Grimes, explained", "meta_data": {"bingbot": "nocache", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@voxdotcom", "url": "https://www.vox.com/2018/8/16/17692700/azealia-banks-elon-musk-grimes-explained", "title": "The billionaire house hostage saga of Azealia Banks, Elon Musk, and Grimes, explained", "description": "Here\u2019s the background you need to understand the story.", "image": {"identifier": "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/12162375/481892586.jpg.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C1.4283925888833%2C100%2C78.652009427754&w=1200", "alt": "Splendour In The Grass 2015 -
