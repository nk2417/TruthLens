After her revealing admission, fans on Twitter were quick to offer their condolences to the star about her late father.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, many tweeted their kind sentiments to the very alive actor Richard Dreyfuss, who is most famous for his role in \u201cJaws\u201d and \u201cWhat About Bob?\u201d. The spelling of Dreyfuss, versus Dreyfus, is also a nice hint that he\u2019s not related to the \u201cVeep\u201d star.\n\nDreyfuss \u2015 who again, is NOT dead, nor is he Louis-Dreyfus\u2019 father, luckily has a great sense of humor and tweeted about the incident:\n\nI'm actually not Julia Louis-Dreyfus' father. But I really appreciate all the concerned tweets. https://t.co/4heUxufeOa \u2014 Richard Dreyfuss (@RichardDreyfuss) September 19, 2016\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlive and tweetin\u2019, people.\n\nFor reference: Julia Louis-Dreyfus and her father, William, in 2014.
