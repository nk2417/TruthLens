The couple was returning home from a celebration for Teresa Giudice\u2019s daughter, Audriana\u2019s first communion.\n\nThe Holmdel police report says the pair arrived home after the festivities on Saturday night and opened their front door to find two masked individuals inside the house. The robbers then rushed towards the two and struck Cantin with a baseball bat several times. Manzo was punched multiple times.\n\nUp Next: \u2018Real Housewives of New Jersey\u2019 Star Dina Manzo and Boyfriend Dave Cantin Brutally Beaten During Home Robbery\n\nBefore the robbers left Dina\u2019s home, they tied her and David up before fleeing with cash and jewelry.
