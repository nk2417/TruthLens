It wouldn't be a Kardashian photoshoot without drama. Per KUWTK tradition, arguments kicked off over the planning of the family's annual Christmas card shoot during the season 15 premiere. When Kourtney begins to be difficult about her schedule, Kim snaps at her older sister. \"I need Kourtney to not be so f\u2014ing annoying with a stick up her a\u2014 like she f\u2014ing runs this s\u2014, because she doesn't,\" she says after Kourtney leaves the room. \"She's the least exciting to look at.\"\n\n02 of 10 ... and slammed her for not having a business, in the same argument \"Maybe if you had a f\u2014ing business that you were passionate about \u2026 but you don't,\" Kim shouts at Kourtney. \"So don't even act like you know what I'm talking about.\"\n\n03 of 10 When she said she 'cringes' at Khlo\u00e9's outfits E! Kim believes Khlo\u00e9 is still finding her sense of style, even though her younger sister has designed her own denim line, Good American. \"I always cringe when I look at Khlo\u00e9 in outfits,\" Kim says in season 14 while scrolling through her Instagram. \"You know what, she's so trendy, and I used to be that way, but she is like that on steroids.\" Kim and her BFF Jonathan Cheban raid Khlo\u00e9's closet in the episode to create specific outfits for her sister's upcoming trip. They pack Polaroid photos of the complete outfits in her luggage, so Khlo\u00e9 knows exactly how to wear everything.\n\n04 of 10 When they took a trip to Japan and she was 'so disgusted' with her sisters' 'crazy outfits' Khloe Kardashian/Instagram; Kourtney Kardashian/Instagram After Kim planned a trip to Japan this past February to shoot a Yeezy campaign debuting season 7, things didn't go as she expected, all because of her sisters' fashion choices. \"I can't even eat dinner because I'm so disgusted with my sisters' crazy outfits that completely don't go with my look,\" she says. \"Like, I can't take it.\" \"My sisters look so crazy,\" she goes on. \"It's actually embarrassing. Kourtney with the Japanese-inspired outfit, and Khlo\u00e9 is wearing silver sequins, turquoise eyeshadow, huge chandelier earrings \u2014 they're just like, completely clashing and making my outfit look really bad and they're ruining everything. I need the Yeezy collection to be debuted and not all this crazy distraction in the background.\"\n\n05 of 10 ... and when she called Kourtney a 'f\u2014ing clown' and a 'f\u2014ing grandma' during the same trip Kourtney Kardashian/Instagram \"You guys, you look like f\u2014ing clowns. I'm not f\u2014ing kidding,\" Kim says to her sisters. \"This is not a tourist thing where it's like, Halloween, dress up like a f\u2014ing Japanese geisha, unless we're at a geisha house.\" While Kourtney thinks her outfit \"was fun for Japan,\" Kim says it \"would have been great ... if you didn't have f\u2014ing blue eye shadow.\" At one point, she tells Kourtney she looked \"like a f\u2014ing grandma, 100 percent.\"\n\n06 of 10 When she called Khlo\u00e9 out for 'talking s\u2014' about her then-fianc\u00e9, Kris Humphries Denise Truscello/WireImage Khlo\u00e9 wasn't Kris Humphries' biggest fan back in the day, and when Kim finds out she was telling him things like \"they were getting married too soon\" in season 6, she uninvites her from the wedding. \"He's disrespectful to me, and to mom, and to Kourtney,\" Khlo\u00e9 says, but Kim isn't having it. \"If you're all talking s\u2014 behind my back, there's no reason why any of you should be at my wedding,\" Kim replies.\n\n07 of 10 When she told Kourtney she 'bought her a f\u2014ing career' Denise Truscello/WireImage; Inset: Getty Kim didn't hold back from telling Kourtney what she really thought when Kourtney refused to let her likeness be used in the mobile game Kim Kardashian: Hollywood. \"I've done so much for you. And for Scott [Disick] to call me and say, 'You should buy her a pair of shoes to put her character in the game,'\" Kim says in the season 10 episode. \"I said to Scott, 'I'm not buying her a f\u2014ing pair of shoes, I bought her a f\u2014ing career!'\"\n\n08 of 10 When she told Khlo\u00e9 her snappy attitude wasn't 'valid' E! In Season 14, Khlo\u00e9 gets annoyed with Kim after she shares a story with her that she doesn't believe. \"Why can't you just believe my story?\" Khlo\u00e9 says. \"You piss me off, because you never believe me.\" After their fight, Khlo\u00e9 calls her big sis to make up, but Kim isn't ready to be friends again. \"You just like, snap for no reason,\" Kim says. \"It's just crazy how you snap, and it's not even valid. Call me back when you feel like being a nice human being instead of being a f\u2014ing bitch all the time.\"\n\n09 of 10 When she called Khlo\u00e9 a 'big bully' Gregory Pace/REX/Shutterstock During a season 13 family trip to Costa Rica, things get heated between the Kardashians when Khlo\u00e9 points out that the family isn't really hanging out together on the vacation. Kim quickly defends herself: \"Just because I was afraid of the whitewater rafting? Like, what's the point of making it not fun for us to want to hang out with you if you're always snappy?\" \"You're the negative one, just saying how awful we are,\" Kim adds. \"You're like a big bully that bullies all of us!\"", "images":
