Harry Styles gave James Corden a kiss during a Christmas-themed \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d segment on The Late Late Show on Monday, December 11.\n\nRelated: Harry Styles\u2019 Fashion Evolution Harry Styles first became a household name following the formation of One Direction on the U.K.'s The X Factor in 2010 \u2014 See how his fashion has changed over the years!\n\nThe late-night host, 39, enlisted several of his Carpool Karaoke guests from the past year \u2014 including Pink, Miley Cyrus, Bruno Mars, Sam Smith, Kelly Clarkson and Fifth Harmony \u2014 to sing a fun-filled rendition of the Christmas classic \u201cSanta Claus Is Comin\u2019 to Town.\u201d\n\nThe holiday sketch kicked off with Corden and musician Reggie Watts, who leads the Late Late Show\u2019s house band, cruising around Los Angeles. \u201cThe great thing about this time of year is I feel like it\u2019s the only time we\u2019re not judged for driving to work dressed like this,\u201d quipped the British star, who was clad in a red Santa hat and a Christmas sweater.\n\nRelated: One Direction\u2019s Craziest Antics!

He then leaned in to kiss Corden on the lips, placing one of his hands on the comedian\u2019s cheek and wrapping the other around his head.\n\n\u201cWow, I did not expect that for Christmas,\u201d the TV personality said with a laugh.\n\nRelated: Stars Caught on the Kiss Cam!
