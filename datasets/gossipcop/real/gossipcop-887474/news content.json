Why? Not only is he adorable, but he proved he's an absolute sweetie when he comforted this crying bridesmaid at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, and he's also shattering gender stereotypes by taking ballet classes.\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton often share anecdotes about the little royal. Recently, Kate attended an event at the V&A and spoke to one of the venue's senior curators, Martin Barnes.\n\nAccording to Hello, Barnes explained to her that one of the featured photographers, William Henry Fox Talbot, \u2018wanted nature to draw its own picture on the paper instead of failing with the pencil\u2019. It struck a hilarious note with Kate as it reminded her of Prince George.\n\n\u2018She said, \u2018George would do that!\u2019 \u2013 that is blame the pencil, which was sweet,\u2019 Barnes told the magazine.\n\nBut more recently, William decided to share which Disney film Prince George loves the most - and to be honest, same.\n\nAt a recent royal engagement, the Duke of Cambridge was asked by a little boy what TV show Prince George likes to watch.\n\nMarie Claire Newsletter Celebrity news, beauty, fashion advice, and fascinating features, delivered straight to your inbox!

They're just like us.", "images": ["https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gf7MJEq3y7vf2EQmvJWGiF.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrQ6PjRxjJknCsx7g4bJp-2560-80.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xCToyZnMrdZb8o8guJ9UPm.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PpZp8DqaRtZ5xN7SxXFWfR.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vwKZuK6q76cZqpFNJMXDdN.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XGMbuyG5aseDpYSkUU7ziQ-200-80.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/flexiimages/mednnv697g1760357120.png", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yyMohVbCBmx4onk9Sg4Sy5.png", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6RWNdJQ7JjeAHQCBruEA8X.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/muAjKYWvgogTxMmzdM8ARN.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jz6fdc25SLmgShiCWcavT6.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ERcPkGdS6qMvKLGgBPQSKm.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p/?c1=2&c2=10055482&cv=4.4.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XGMbuyG5aseDpYSkUU7ziQ.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T7wdtxzbu7Vr7QcYXCvNdm.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XYYhTGdjBZ75AtxkakRpd7.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DH3sVYvWgLUBcZKhBE58td.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MdFkDiwpxqeVfdgqNDyDPA.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZLxvQGrVpeiRzbK7oJKssm.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/omcVLDXHhSHmh3uLJAityd.png", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4U7Q66P3qJpnM97VRyzhsd.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j35rejVGkBV9vhwSjEvARa.png", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/imT549zXMfsqpq4f8BBLX3.png", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MkYEStRaNnntu9BWBCvKoZ.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sZZfnfTVmVr6AakCDoEXfR.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrQ6PjRxjJknCsx7g4bJp.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Ynwvaf4XPbWCLcx6aAzUZ.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/flexiimages/30x0h4jexz1665657665.svg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N7gPfYiPRRcQjYdaVBm8jk.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UpggWwHs4SyUpnnUPzGJiF.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ePu83wGsVvz4UTUDHbGWsk.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrQ6PjRxjJknCsx7g4bJp-2560-80.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jadie Troy-Pryde", "News Editor", "Social Links Navigation"], "canonical_link": "https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/celebrity-news/prince-george-favourite-disney-film-623104", "title": "This is Prince George's favourite Disney film and we can relate", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "pub_date": "2018-10-25T12:06:37+00:00", "description": "Prince William just revealed which Disney film that Prince George loves the most, and we're certain that you'll agree with him.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/flexiimages/gich8ywzch1659617848.png", "og": {"site_name": "Marie Claire UK", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrQ6PjRxjJknCsx7g4bJp-2560-80.jpg", "width": 2560, "height": 1732}, "type": "article", "title": "This is Prince George's favourite Disney film and we can relate", "url": "https://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/celebrity-news/prince-george-favourite-disney-film-623104", "description": "It's a classic"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MarieClaireUK/", "published_time": "2018-10-25T12:06:37Z"}, "mrf": {"tags": "region:GB;articleType:News;control:serversidehawk;control:van-enable-adviser-more-about;category:Celebrity News;freeform:Meghan, Duchess of Sussex;freeform:Prince Harry"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "marieclaireuk", "title": "This is Prince George's favourite Disney film and we can relate", "description": "It's a classic", "creator": "marieclaireuk", "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jrQ6PjRxjJknCsx7g4bJp-1200-80.jpg", "account_id": 9696142}, "google-site-verification": "yIeI3xewp1Vc5WrxptNtgP6GlK_oeSo-8hblyIcOYJg", "msvalidate.01": "CC462E6DF91492086145CA5EBDCB615E"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1540469197.0, "source": "https://www.marieclaire.co.uk", "summary": ""}
