Why Trust Us?\n\nBetween coaching on The Voice, working on a brand new album (!), raising her four kids, and hosting her very own talk show, 37-year-old Kelly Clarkson certainly has her hands full. But after almost every appearance, be it on-screen or on-stage, something about the star seems to surface as a topic of conversation (aside from her killer style): Kelly's weight.\n\nThe singer has a history of promoting body positivity, and she always stuns regardless of her size. But she really has lost weight recently\u201437 pounds to be exact.\n\nLucky for everyone who's wondering how she did it, Kelly isn't one to hold back details about her personal life. Here's everything you need to know about her weight loss, workout philosophy, and the diet that works best for her.\n\nDoes Kelly work out?\n\nNo! Although she has shed a significant number of pounds, Kelly claims it's not from exercise.\n\n\"I'm not working out!\" the star said in a red carpet interview with Extra. \"I think people think I'm working out and I'm like, 'Don't think I'm going to come play some sport!'\"\n\n\n\nIn fact, she's not a fan of exercising at all.\n\n\"This just in.... I still hate working out. I\u2019m sweaty, red, and not any thinner . . . people say it\u2019s good for your heart.... but people also say red wine is good for your heart,\" Kelly admitted on Twitter. \"I mean, I\u2019m just stating facts here people. Who am I to ignore science?! #cardioversuswine.\"\n\nSo...how did Kelly lose weight?\n\nThe American Idol alum first revealed her weight loss secret at the 2018 CMT Awards and during an interview on Today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"I had an autoimmune disease and a thyroid problem that started in 2006,\" Kelly explained to Hoda Kotb. \"I read this book, it's called [by Steven R. Gundry, MD], and it might not work for you but it worked wonders for me.\"\n\n\"I'm, like, 37 pounds lighter,\" she said.\n\nKelly's openness about the method that worked for her wasn't enough to stop false diet rumors from circulating\u2014but she was quick to shut them down.\n\n\"Fake news that\u2019s going around about me is that I\u2019ve been taking weird pills 4 weight loss or doing weird fad diets,\" she wrote on Twitter, before confirming that these claims aren't true. \"I eat the same stuff I always have. It\u2019s all just made w/different flours/sugars/ingredients.\"\n\nWhen a fan seeking weight loss advice replied asking for a \"decent plan\" that she could \"stick with,\" Kelly reiterated her success with The Plant Paradox.\n\n\"I read The Plant Paradox by Dr. Gundry,\" she explained. \"He gives you yes & no lists 2 go by & tells why you should avoid things & basically it all comes down to lectins & inflammation.\" Kelly admitted that it as a \"very detailed read\" that feels like a \"science class,\" but promised that it has been helpful for her.\n\n\n\nWhat does Kelly think of body shamers?\n\nEven with her new look, Kelly is staying true to her body-positive attitude.\n\n\"For me, it wasn't really [about] the weight,\" she said on Today. \"For me it was that I'm not on my medicine anymore.\"\n\nThe singer has spoken candidly about criticism she's faced for her size over the years.\n\n\"I was the biggest girl in the [American Idol cast],\" Kelly told Ellen DeGeneres in 2015. \"And I wasn't big, but people would call me big ... I've kind of always gotten that.\"\n\nBut somewhere along the line, she learned to ignore it. As Kelly told the Daily Mail in 2017: \"Too skinny, too fat, too blonde\u2014so much blah. This is who I am and I'm happy. Happy looks different on everyone.\"", "images": ["https://www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/images/privacy/opt-out.66f7eeb.svg",
