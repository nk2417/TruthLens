The comedian has mercilessly jabbed at the president since the campaign trail, honing his voice as David Letterman\u2019s replacement on The Late Show with Trump as his perennial punching bag. (He even got him to respond once.) So on Sunday night, as he approached the lectern to kick off the 2017 Emmy Awards gala, Colbert naturally used his platform to rip the president. There was one surprise, however: a guest appearance by Sean Spicer.\n\nFor his opening act, Colbert did a song-and-dance number running through various shows up for Emmys this year, including This Is Us, Stranger Things, and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. The chorus? \u201cEverything is better on TV\u201d\u2014including, in a slightly more veiled jab at Trump, \u201ctreason.\u201d Once he finally took the stage\u2014along with a chorus of dancing Handmaids\u2014Colbert thanked first responders for their work following hurricanes in Texas and Florida. After that, however, he didn\u2019t take long to get to the Trump jokes: \u201cIf he had won an Emmy,\u201d Colbert quipped, \u201cI bet he never would have run for president. So in a way, this is your fault. I thought you people loved morally compromised antiheroes. You liked Walter White; he\u2019s just Walter, much whiter.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnlike the presidency,\u201d Colbert added, \u201cEmmys go to the winner of the popular vote.\u201d\n\nStill, Colbert couldn\u2019t leave the stage without finding some special way to hit the president where it really hurts. So he brought out his secret weapon: Sean Spicer.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59bf15374dfb6d07561c428c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/giphy%2520(18).gif",
