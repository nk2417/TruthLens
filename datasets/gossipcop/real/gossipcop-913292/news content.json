Gomez and Justin Bieber were about to make their first public outing as a couple at NYFW, the pair have actually stayed in Los Angeles.\n\nWell done, guys, you duped us.\n\nFrom the looks of things, the pair enjoyed a romantic staycation on the West Coast as they were photographed together over the weekend at Laguna Beach.\n\nRead Next\n\nFans caught sight of the pair at the beach, looking into the distance and contemplating life, as they wore matching nude-coloured tones.\n\nIn another snap, the couple - who were rumoured to have began dating again in November 2017 - were snapped by eagle-eyed fans at Laguna Beach's Montage hotel.\n\nWe're not going to lie, we're a bit freaked out at how spy-like some fans have reacted at spotting the pair on holiday, but we appreciate their efforts.\n\nLaguna Beach is located roughly an hour and a half's drive away from Studio City, where Gomez bought a house in July 2017.\n\nAs a result, we have a feeling their trip to LAX - which we reported on over the weekend and lead fans to believe the pair were flying to New York City - might have been a decoy to provide some privacy for the pair.\n\nOn Sunday, the two parted ways; Bieber was later filmed attending church while the 'Bad Liar' singer was spotted at Disneyland, where she posed with fans.\n\nAs the face of Coach, Gomez is widely believed to attend the brand's AW18 show today having attended the company's two previous shows.\n\nThe brand confirmed her attendance at today's show:\n\nUnfortunately, we have no news as to whether Bieber will be joining his girlfriend during NYFW, but we presume their mini staycation in Laguna Beach was a way of prematurely celebrating V-Day.\n\nRelated Story Cardi B Is Quickly Becoming NYFW\\'s Style Icon\n\nRelated Story Kim
