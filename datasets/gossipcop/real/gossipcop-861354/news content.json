Cami Morrone channeled Maria Callas in Reem Acra\u2019s voluminous rose jersey column, while Kiki Layne (in Prada), Mackenzie Foy (in Rodarte), and Keira Knightley (in Chanel Haute Couture) went full-on Cinderella in confections of chiffon, taffeta, and tulle. In Los Angeles for the LACMA gala Kim Kardashian West was throwback-supermodel sultry in vintage Gucci by Tom Ford and Lou Doillon was a dazzling update on Rita Hayworth in Alessandro Michele\u2019s beaded golden stunner. Smart spins on black after dark? Look no further than Zo\u00eb Kravitz in an off-the-shoulder, pearl-adorned column by Gabriela Hearst, or Cate Blanchett in an asymmetric beauty by Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy. Another accolade for Givenchy: Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, who closed her Australian tour in the label\u2019s pleated knit skirt and tailored sweater. Pregnant and on the move, she makes world-shaking style look so easy.", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bdf7626a6b31845169682d1/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/1.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6907746f1dd6ad7f04518d0a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68ffcf6842b9077c28ec7228/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68f7977e0f2e539d48281261/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bdf76273d62f84b2e384ed5/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/2.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68ffd73bc910e2fe195e7a99/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bdf762aa6b31845169682d5/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/4.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/690710ae707d22899b86e691/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bdf761e3f0a9344b1de409d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/1.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/us/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bdf76273f0a9344b1de409f/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/3.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6901437814f40d7384d1d55e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/65b2ce410926f46c5f666bb2/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6905005a66c1c16263e7c92f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue-global/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bdf7628a6b31845169682d3/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/5.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68ff1d9b5b2a6ac382737563/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/690953df7cb70616c5d9b941/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/68ff8ec43827e6e4dd940ebf/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/690950ddac92a58d3fef5d17/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bdf761e3f0a9344b1de409d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Edward Barsamian"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/slideshow/10-best-dressed-cate-blanchett-kim-kardashian-west-meghan-markle-celebrity-style", "title": "10 Best Dressed: Week of November 5, 2018", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Edward Barsamian", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Femininity and iconicity: herewith the twin aspirations of the world\u2019s most stylish as they slunk into November.", "id": "5bdf7519ab3bf12d260813f5", "keywords": "best dressed,meghan markle,cate blanchett,kim kardashian", "news_keywords": "best dressed,meghan markle,cate blanchett,kim kardashian", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=289380413, app-argument=https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id289380413?pt=45076&ct=VOG_Smart_Banner&mt=8", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "gallery", "parsely-post-id": "5bdf7519ab3bf12d260813f5", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Femininity and iconicity: herewith the twin aspirations of the world\u2019s most stylish as they slunk into November.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bdf7600e3d6652d9e8093ec/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/1.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bdf7600e3d6652d9e8093ec/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/1.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Femininity and iconicity: herewith the twin aspirations of the world\u2019s most stylish as they slunk into November.
