The players jointly decided this was the best course of action,\u201d the statement said. \u201cOur commitment to the military and our community is resolute and the absence of our team for the national anthem shouldn\u2019t be misconstrued as unpatriotic.\u201d\n\nScott Winters/Icon Sportswire/Getty\n\nHowever, Jessie said her husband, a wide receiver for the Titans, was unaware of the protest.\n\n\u201cSadly he wasn\u2019t made aware that a decision had made for him until he came out and it was over,\u201d the 29-year-old country singer said in response to an Instagram follower\u2019s comment.\n\nIn response to another fan, she wrote, \u201cIf he had known he would have been out there hand over heart. Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t made aware it was time to head to the field as they always do every game.\u201d\n\nJessie, 29, shared a video of her singing the national anthem on Sept. 10 and wrote what the song meant to her.\n\n\u201cOne of my favorite things to do is sing the national anthem,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI think about my dad, my uncles, my cousins, both grandfathers who fought in the Vietnam war. I think about how my grandfather paw paw Tim would ask me to sing this song for him every time I saw him and how he would make me turn the other way to sing it so he could just weep and cry as hard as he wanted because it meant so much to him.\u201d\n\nShe added that the song is about troops who have sacrificed to fight for the nation.\n\n\u201cI love our country so much,\u201d Jessie wrote. \u201cAnd we should all love and respect each other because this is the greatest country in the world. I see the love. I see the unity in all walks of life on a daily basis and it makes me so proud to be an American.\u201d\n\nBefore facing off in London, multiple players on both the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars took a knee during the national anthem on Sunday.\n\nJaguars owner Shad Khan, the only non-white owner in the NFL, stood and linked arms with players Marcedes Lewis and Telvin Smith.\n\nAccording to ESPN, several Miami Dolphins players donned \u2018IMWITHKAP\u2019 shirts ahead of their game against the New York Jets.\n\nTom Brady shared a photo on Instagram Sunday showing him and teammate Phillip Dorsett during a game, subtly showing support for the movement.\n\nWATCH: The National Anthem Takes Center Stage Across the NFL\n\nIn August 2016, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick made headlines \u2014 and sparked a movement \u2014 when he took a knee during the national anthem.\n\n\u201cI am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\u201d Kaepernick said at the time. \u201cTo me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.\u201d\n\nDuring a rally speech in Alabama on Friday, Trump stated, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, say, \u2018Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out, you\u2019re fired.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe followed this up by pouring more gasoline on the fire with a series of tweets. \u201cIf a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL, or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect\u2026our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf not, YOU\u2019RE FIRED. Find something else to do!\u201d\n\nNumerous celebrities \u2014 including Diddy \u2014 have also joined in standing behind the players, causing a resurgence of the #TakeAKnee hashtag on social media.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/5QOd8bz_onvDg4ogYViGgyYR1nQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Daiyan-Henley-110325-be5e5c96a6974ed5a75ca07f8903887b.jpg",
