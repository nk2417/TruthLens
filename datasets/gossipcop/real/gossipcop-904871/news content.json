Love makes you do f***ed up things. Do you think anyone\u2019s proud of that? No.\n\n\u2018You don\u2019t f**k with someone\u2019s heart and emotions.\u2019\n\nRob and Blac furiously split last year, after Rob posted a series of explicit photos of Blac and made various unfounded claims including drug abuse and infidelity.\n\nRob Kardashian and Blac Chyna had a pretty fiery break-up (Picture: FilmMagic)\n\nAs well as making these outrageous claims, Kim Kardashian\u2019s younger brother also shared pictures of the man that his former fiance was allegedly sleeping with, sharing a snap of him in what he claims was their bed.\n\nIn October 2017 it was reported that Rob had 50/50 custody of the child and was allegedly paying out $20,000 (\u00a314,928.06) in child support payments.\n\nChyna was granted a restraining order against Rob after his explosive social media rant, which saw him accuse her of being on drugs and unfaithful during their relationship, to which she fired back with the accusations of domestic violence.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
