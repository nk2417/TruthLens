She also roasted his first film role in Teen Wolf Too by showing off a Muppets Magazine cover featuring the young star.\n\n\u201cOne thing has proven itself to be true and that is having longevity in this business is not easy,\u201d Aniston said. \u201cEspecially starting out as a child actor. Usually that\u2019s a story that doesn\u2019t always end well. When I actually met Jason it was kind of looking like it could go either way.\u201d\n\nMore: \u2018Ozark\u2019 Showrunner Reveals How Long He Thinks the Series Should Last\n\nShe also shared a humorous story about a New Year\u2019s ski trip she attended with Bateman that featured the Ozark star nearly crashing his car.\n\n\u201cPicture this: It\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve. It\u2019s just after midnight and there is a blizzard outside. I hear someone yell, \u2018Help! Someone Help! Jason. Car. Someone could die.\u2019\u201d Aniston recalled. \u201cSo we run outside to help him and what we see is, we have two feet of snow, Jason is in a truck fishtailing away down a one-way street hanging with the door wide open, hanging half way out of the car.\n\n\u201cHis foot was out trying to stop the car kind of like Fred Flintstone. It\u2019s still not clear what you were doing, a little foggy right? You don\u2019t remember. Thankfully he outgrew those days of terrifying people.\u201d\n\nShe decided to end on a more positive note, but still adding in some jokes for good measure.\n\n\u201cHe looks 12. He acts 100. A head of hair that women envy. He works hard. He\u2019s tired. Even in his most restful state, he\u2019s one of the loveliest men to be around,\u201d she said. \u201cHe always gives you deep connection, full attention, authenticity and some of the deepest belly laughs that I can remember. We are so very proud of you.\u201d", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/snl-50-my-best-friends-house-ariana-grande-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/the-real-housewives-of-orange-county-logo-1.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/08/32a08016-72b7-41f8-b593-df0f660db84e.png?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["John Connor Coulston", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/jennifer-aniston-jason-bateman-hollywood-walk-of-fame/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Hilariously Turned Jason Bateman\u2019s Walk of Fame Ceremony Into a Roast", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Hilariously Turned Jason Bateman's Walk of Fame Ceremony Into a Roast", "description": "Jason Bateman received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Wednesday, with a speech by none other than his frequent co-star and friend Jennifer Aniston.
