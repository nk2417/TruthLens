She\u2019s my friend.\u2019\n\nBut after Tori walked away in disgust at her co-star's latest lame excuses for being so late, Shannen - played in the drama by Samantha Munro - made her biggest mistake by picking on the daughter of the show\u2019s boss.\n\n\u2018You better watch you\u2019re back,\u2019 Shannen is seen warning Tori, played in the Lifetime recreation by Abby Ross.\n\nUnion busting: Shannen walks in on her castmates plotting against her after turning up late yet again\n\nSpelling mistake: She blunders by clashing with her only friend left on the show\n\nI'm telling my daddy on you: And it is not long before Aaron decides to pull the trigger on the bad girl\n\nParty on dude: She paraphrases era stalwarts Bill and Ted by saying she cannot wait to party hard\n\nGabrielle Carteris, played Michele Goyns, predicted that it would be a fatal move by her co-star.\n\n\u2018What do you think the employee handbook says about threatening your boss\u2019s daughter?\u2019 she asked Jason Priestley, played by Max Lloyd-Jones.\n\nThe Lifetime drama suggested it was the final straw, with the next scene cutting to a news announcement about Shannen\u2019s departure, and a smiling Aaron telling colleagues that they were nicer to her than they could have been.\n\nBut the drama suggests it was a complete u-turn from his attitude from before Shannen offended his daughter, showing him stand up for her despite a barrage of complaints about her behavior, being told the entire cast and crew \u2018loathe her\u2019.\n\nGarth brooks a grudge: Jennie challenges her foe to a punch up after she pinches her during a scene\n\nThe fighting Irish: And Shannen is only too happy to take her outside for some fisticuffs\n\nReady to explode: Jennie is fuming as they get ready to tussle in the parking lot\n\nHow does this grab you: But Shannen is just as angry and gives her foe some whiplash\n\n\u2018I understand, and I\u2019ve heard everyone,\u2019 Aaron, played by Dan Castellaneta, had insisted. \u2018But as far as I\u2019m concerned Shannen stays.\u2019\n\nBut the drama suggested Tori was a key figure not just in the end of Shannen\u2019s run on the show - but even for the show ever getting going in the first place.\n\nAs her father initially showed no interest in a pitch for the show, the Unauthorized Story suggests some key chats with Tori turned him around.\n\n\u2018Every show you make is for adults,\u2019 she complained to him in an early scene.\n\nComing to 9021 blows: The dynamic duo engage in a shoving match in glamorous Van Nuys\n\nNo need to be so pushy: They end up shoving each other back and forward as things heat up\n\nWatch my bodywork: Jason Priestley is none to pleased when Garth ends up sprawled on his bonnet\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a lot of cool young actors around who never get the chance to do anything good,\u2019 she complained, insisting: \u2018I\u2019m really good.\u2019\n\nShe then warned him: \u2018Maybe the reason you don\u2019t have any shows on right now is because the audience is getting younger and cooler.\u2019\n\nThe drama suggested she also made a key decision when her dad could not find suitable stars to play the two main characters, brother and sister Brenda and Brandon Walsh, with Tori suggesting both Shannen and Jason Priestley.\n\nPep talk gone bad: Ian Ziering takes her out for a spin in his sports car to pass on some advice but ends up being talked into letting her drive it\n\nHe will want to throttle her in a minute: She slams on the gas and soon loses control of the powerful motor\n\nFender's pancake: She smashes his precious vehicle into a construction site\n\nFall guy: And he tries to avoid getting his friend in trouble by saying he was the one behind the wheel\n\nThe drama also insisted that Tori genuinely impressed everyone with her acting during her audition - even thought they knew who she really was despite using the name Tori Mitchell.\n\n\u2018Who would have known?\u2019 one of the casting director asked in supposed amazement at her skills that his colleague called \u2018great\u2019.\n\nLuke Perry - played by Jesy McKinney - has the most interesting hiring story, as he is seen digging roads in a construction job before going for the audition.\n\nAfter initially failing to land the first part he auditioned for, he was called back to play bad boy Dylan McKay when the pilot proved it needed an edgy character - with Luke supposedly having to borrow a shirt for the audition and then grumpily smoking throughout.\n\nNo more Love Boat daddy: Aaron is portrayed as being stuck in the times in the film\n\nInteresting Tori: In fact his daughter pushes him to make the show and even makes casting suggestions\n\nPriestley, meanwhile, is seen with a roommate at their scruffy home when a script is delivered - but it actually being the Thelma & Louise script for their other roommate, Brad Pitt.\n\n\u2018Pitt\u2019s not home. Come to think of it, he\u2019s hardly ever home these days,\u2019 the roommate told the delivery guy, before telling Priestley he should also audition for the movie role. \u2018You\u2019re definitely as pretty as Pitt,\u2019 he teased him.\n\nWhen the show starts - with the actors taking very humble dressing rooms in a studio covered in boxes and garbage - they seem convinced the show will not take off, but soon appear to form fast friendships.\n\nPriestley and Doherty, in fact, are shown appearing a little too friendly in their audition - repeatedly being told not to be so flirty and intimate as they will be playing brother and sister.\n\nPaving the way to success: Wannabe Luke Perry's true talent is revealed when he is shown laying a road\n\nLooking to score a hit: Garth crooks her neck up when she hears about the show in development\n\nSoaring success: After a faltering start the show is a massive hit thanks to strong summer run\n\nLuke Perry is then seen getting a little too frisky with Doherty, grabbing her breast during a scene - and insisting: \u2018That\u2019s where the hands go, I have no control over them.\u2019\n\nIt is an intimacy that supposedly soon takes hold amongst the cast off-screen, too, with one crew member insisting: \u2018Everyone is making out with everyone.\u2019\n\nSex also causes problems onscreen when an episode showing Shannen\u2019s character losing her video loses advertisers.\n\nThat put a smile on her face: The show lovingly recreated the then controversial moment Shannen's character Brenda Walsh boasted about losing her virginity\n\nTaking one for the team: The show's creator had to beg Perry and Doherty to film a scene where they regret their actions\n\nTrappings of success: Perry and Priestley are soon munching burgers at high-end restaurants\n\nYou do Ron? President Reagan is even seen interrupting their meal to tell them he is a big fan of the show\n\nModern day Beatles: The dynamic duo are mobbed by excited young women wherever they go\n\n\u2018This is important - this is about delivering a real message,\u2019 show creator Darren Star complained when told the have to change the situation and see Shannen upset about having sex.\n\n\u2018We live in a world where a girl doesn\u2019t have to be totally shamed for losing her virginity. We probably showed the most sophisticated depiction of teen sex in the history of television,\u2019 he insisted, but ultimately losing his battle.\n\nThe drama shows how 90210 became so popular Aaron told the actors they were \u2018about to become The Beatles\u2019.\n\nAnd Priestley and Perry are then seen at lunch getting greeted by President Ronald Reagan, who told them: \u2018I know you\u2019re show is quite popular, Nancy and I have actually watched it.\u2019\n\nJoking that they are \u2018probably not your demographic\u2019, the President is supposed to have then told them he could \u2018use you on Capital Hill\u2019 if they remain so popular.\n\nNightclub brawl: Shannen jumps in for wimp Brian Austin Green after he is threatened at a nightspot\n\nFighting Irish part two: And Doherty proves quite able to handle herself against the bigger man\n\nWhile the male stars are all seen being best buddies off-screen, too, Shannen\u2019s constant lateness starts annoying everyone - and a clear feud is shown with Jennie Garth, played by Abbie Cobb.\n\nIt gets so bad they are seen storming off set to have a fight - with Perry and Priestley having to pull them apart.\n\nShannen is shown supposedly apologizing to Garth when they are left alone during a night out at The Roxbury nightclub - before she then gets arrested for attacking a fellow clubber who had picked on Brian Austin Green, played by Ross Linton.\n\nThe officer giving her her ticket for \u2018misdemeanor battery\u2019 sums up the general public\u2019s opinion of Doherty at this time, telling her: \u2018Do I know who you are? Yes. You are a big pain in the ass. Everybody thinks that.\u2019\n\nDo you know who I am: She tries to pull her favourite trick when a police offer cites her for battery\n\nEven he watches the show: But he makes clear he dislikes her character on the show as he gives her the ticket\n\nBig news: Once again Shannen's antics are drawing the attention of the showbusiness media\n\nPerhaps the silliest line of the drama comes as Ian Ziering, played by David Lennon, takes Shannen for a drive to try to talk some sense in her, a scene ending with her then crashing his sports car.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re acting crazy - you\u2019re out of control,\u2019 he told her. \u2018You\u2019re like a shark, you\u2019re like a tornado - you\u2019re like a mixture between a shark and a tornado,\u2019 he said, the writers\u2019 clear reference to Ziering\u2019s current fame from Sharknado.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u2019 Shannen\u2019s character shoots back.\n\nAustin Green gets the harshest portrayal, shown throughout as a nerd who everyone teases for his bad dancing and love of hip hop.\n\nBut he ended on a high as new cast member Tiffani-Amber Thiessen, played by Alyssa Lynch, walks in, and he immediately walks up to kiss and hug her and introduce her as \u2018my girl\u2019 to his cast mates\u2019 clear shock.\n\nHaving the last laugh: The show poked fun at the fact she later had starred in Aaron's hit show Charmed in which she played a witch\n\n9021 doh: In the movie it is suggested Doherty had clashed with Garth and Spelling over wearing a red dress for a cast still", "images":
