From opening locations in Los Angeles, Miami and New York, to having our Dash Dolls spin-off show, it\u2019s been such a huge part of our lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve loved running DASH, but in the last few years we\u2019ve all grown so much individually,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve been busy running our own brands, as well as being moms and balancing work with our families. We know in our hearts that it\u2019s time to move on.\u201d\n\nGustavo Caballero/Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe love our DASH Dolls and are so grateful for the amazing memories \u2014 and we have to give a special thanks to the DASH employees and all of the incredible fans and customers who have supported us throughout the years!\u201d Kardashian West added. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have done it without you. Thank you to everyone!\u201d\n\nLooking for more style content?

Kourtney is about to launch a new line with younger sister Kylie Jenner, KOURT X KYLIE.\n\nAll three are also mothers. Kim recently welcomed her third child, daughter Chicago West, while Kourtney has three children under the age of 10 with ex Scott Disick. Khlo\u00e9 recently welcomed her first child, daughter True Thompson.\n\nThe Kardashians\u2019 fashion boutique in their hometown of Calabasas was the first storefront they opened. Later on, their store became a fixture in the first seasons of their hit E! reality show Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nThe sisters were consistently seen managing their store together on the show as they rose to fame. In their spinoff shows, Kourtney and Kim Take Miami and Kourtney and Kim Take New York, they were also seen opening up DASH stores in those major cities.\n\nAnother spinoff show, Dash Dolls, debuted in 2015 and focused on their employees as they got to know the Kardashians and managed the store while the sisters were away.\n\nLast year, an employee in their Los Angeles store was held at gunpoint. A spokesperson for the West Hollywood Sheriff\u2019s Department told PEOPLE at the time that a woman had walked into the store with a revolver and pointed it at one of the employees.\n\n\u201c[She] mumbled something, knocked some things off of the counter and then walked out,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nEarlier in 2017, LAPD investigated a theft that resulted in about $1,400 to $1,600 of stolen items, according to Entertainment Tonight. The suspect was caught on surveillance footage, giving police a good lead.", "images":
