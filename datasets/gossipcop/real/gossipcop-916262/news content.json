A bug. A cloud. A sheep.\u201d\n\nIn the video, Jack helped his dad feed their sheep, while Pratt could be heard encouraging his son, \u201cGood job, buddy!\u201d\n\nPratt has been sharing glimpses of his life in the country on Instagram after taking \u201ca much-needed hiatus\u201d from social media following his divorce from Faris \u2014 and just like his dad, Jack is loving life in the great outdoors.\n\nFor more coverage, follow our babies magazine on Flipboard.\n\n\u201cI have found a new passion to add to my many others. #farmlife and Jack loves it!\u201d Pratt shared in another post. \u201cYou\u2019ll know where to sprinkle my ashes. I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d\n\nWhen Jack isn\u2019t helping his dad on the farm, he\u2019s helping his mom out in the kitchen. Faris, 41, shared a sweet photo of her son baking a treat on the floor of her kitchen on Instagram in January.\n\n\u201cHey dear Campers!! Summer is coming and we are all getting super excited for a fun-filled season of growing, learning, and discovering!\u201d she wrote in the caption.\n\n\u201cMy son Jack is applying to be camp chef! I may be biased but I think he\u2019s pretty darn good! Can\u2019t wait to see you guys this summer!!! Any allergies? Please tell Ken,\u201d she added.", "images":
