As a lifelong fan, Chibnall\u2019s vision of the Doctor was perhaps more progressive than the heads of the BBC were ready to allow. But in 2018, Whittaker is ready to throw down.\n\nHeading into Sunday\u2019s Doctor Who premiere, Whittaker still recalls the day more than a year ago when her casting went viral. \u201cThe announcement was, in my career at that point, the biggest thing that ever happened,\u201d the actress tells The Hollywood Reporter. In the time since she became a household name among the fanboy set, Whittaker has had the opportunity to make her mark on the Doctor.\n\n\u201cShooting the two days of the Christmas special with Peter [Capaldi] \u2014 his final episode and the regeneration \u2014 and then going on with the 10-episode season, it grows in the most organic, ordinary, quite metered way,\u201d Whittaker says.\n\nBelow, Whittaker opens up about what playing the first female Doctor in show history means, advice from her peers and why she wants to be more than a feminist icon.\n\nWhat was the process of becoming the Doctor like for you?\n\nBeing on set for the first time was really emotional, it was incredible for all of us \u2014 Chris Chibnall, for [companions] Brad [Walsh] and Mandip [Gill] and Tosin [Cole]. We were supported by this incredible crew, some of whom have been working on [Doctor Who] for 10 to 15 years. There\u2019s no job like it. It\u2019s quite liberating as an actor, all the hard work has been done over 55 years, generating a fan base all over the world, I just have to make sure I don\u2019t lose it.\n\nDid you and Chris collaborate on what your Doctor would be like?\n\nWe were able to talk about it a lot. All these little things started to happen before anybody knew I was playing the role, so it was a continual conversation. For the character, though, I think Chris had a very clear idea of the Doctor he was writing, and my energy was suited to that. In no way did I have to go, \u201cThis is the type of Doctor I want to play\u201d; it was there on the page.\n\nHow does the Doctor\u2019s femaleness change the role/story? Does it?\n\nWell, it\u2019s less relevant to the Doctor because the Doctor has embraced change, previously, 12 times. It becomes apparent in certain worlds because sometimes we go back in time, where gender played a particular role. And you see in the Christmas special, when I pull the screen around in the TARDIS for the first time \u2014 before I\u2019m rudely kicked out. I saw the woman\u2019s reflection and that being a joy, and it being something new and exciting. It\u2019s certainly not a running theme for me because it is irrelevant to me. My gender, in every part I\u2019ve ever played \u2014 I just am. Gender is irrelevant because it\u2019s about playing an alien timelord so it\u2019s just about inhabiting the truth of the scene and the energy \u2014 and making sure you\u2019re driving the story forward. All those things come naturally anyway, whether that\u2019s being played by a man or a woman.\n\nWhat about femininity, which hasn\u2019t been traditionally seen as a strength onscreen? With Game of Thrones, the more feminine characters are punished but the more masculine types survive. Will your Doctor derive any of her strength from more feminine aspects of herself?\n\nI\u2019m always searching out inspiration from strong, complex and flawed characters. I want to be emotionally and physically challenged and driven to different aspects of my range. The Doctor has personality traits, but they aren\u2019t specific. What\u2019s important is that we don\u2019t attribute them solely to men. They\u2019re the attributes of the Doctor, regardless of who plays that role. It\u2019s the character\u2019s attributes, not the gender. When I was growing up, all the parts I wanted to play were being played by the lads \u2014 it never stopped me believing I wanted to do those things. It\u2019s nice to know if someone\u2019s watching it, you represent something for them that they haven\u2019t necessarily seen before, but it doesn\u2019t affect the playing of the role.\n\nAre you sick of hearing \u201cfirst female Doctor\u201d? It sounds a lot like the inclusion conversation in Hollywood these days.\n\nI\u2019ve been in stuff before where there\u2019s been a female director and it\u2019s like, \u201cI think she was just a director,\u201d or describing someone as a \u201cfemale writer\u201d instead of just a writer. It\u2019s often given to us as this nice little packaged statement. I got asked, \u201cOh, are you going to play the Doctor as a woman?\u201d I\u2019m just going to play it as me. I didn\u2019t approach Beth Latimer on Broadchurch and go, \u201cWhat female qualities will I bring to this?\u201d I just have to play the truth and experience of the scene. And the truth of the scene is my experience, and my truth, but that doesn\u2019t mean it disconnects from anyone else\u2019s truth, it just is a different direction. Like Peter\u2019s truth will be different from Chris Eccleston\u2019s truth, because of life and experience.\n\nIs that frustrating for you? Because it feels like you have to act in a way that looks to the future, but the discourse we\u2019re having is set in the near-past or present.\n\nBeing cast as the first female Doctor is extraordinary, and I\u2019m going to dine out on it forever, but what I can\u2019t wait for is the moment \u2014 because TV does represent the society we live in in every way \u2014 where we don\u2019t just see [stories] from the same perspective continually. That\u2019s being embraced now. Women are not a genre, we\u2019re just the other half of the population. I\u2019m guilty of this as well because when I first started to audition, I kept calling the Doctor a \u201che\u201d \u2014 it was just this automatic thing. Now it\u2019s second nature to me: the Doctor is the Doctor without either/or, but you can\u2019t help but associate it with that because that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been known.\n\nWith your casting, you\u2019re helping reframe what identity means to the show. To that end, how much of a feminist icon do you think this character will become now?\n\nIt\u2019s about being an icon for everyone, which is what the Doctor has always been. Doctor Who has always had a fanbase that is very diverse, with male and female fans of all ages. For me it\u2019s about saying, \u201cListen, there are 12-year-old boys watching this show, who have women in their life that they probably look up to; it isn\u2019t weird to look up to women. You probably look up to your mom or your aunt or your grandmom!\u201d The wonderful thing about this role is that the people that you\u2019re regenerating into look like you could live next door to them \u2014 they\u2019re not chiseled out of rock or have this extraordinary muscle tone. [Laughs.] It\u2019s very ordinary bodies with an extraordinary alien inside, and that\u2019s what\u2019s appealing about it: it\u2019s an icon for all. Being a woman, you have young kids looking up to you like they didn\u2019t before. Like the young girl who\u2019s not previously had the show she\u2019s followed all her life have a woman that looked like her at the helm. Because you\u2019re always on the sidelines very often, aren\u2019t you? \u2026 I think it\u2019s going to, hopefully, be a role for all people \u2014 including new viewers who may have previously thought this show wasn\u2019t necessarily for them.\n\nWhy do you think it took so long for this franchise to cast a female Doctor?\n\nIn like the \u201980s, there was a talk show where it was suggested. For Chris, who says watching Doctor Who was his first memory, it was the direction that he wanted to take the show in as a fan. This happened before all the [#MeToo] revelations within the industry. It feels timely because we\u2019re at a moment where we\u2019re being heard, and that\u2019s only a good thing. We are sitting in the cinemas and seeing versions of ourselves onscreen and in places of power, which is exciting and about time. It\u2019s 2018, we\u2019re all ready for it \u2014 it\u2019s not such an unusual thing to see a female Doctor.\n\nFan reaction can be vitriolic in fandoms as large as Doctor Who. We saw that with Star Wars\u2018 Kelly Marie Tran being bullied off social media earlier this year. Have you experienced anything like that in your time thus far?\n\nI haven\u2019t. I\u2019m not on social media. I\u2019ve not opened myself up to that because to do so would involve someone walking across the street and saying it to my face. That\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t happen, because people hide behind their Twitter handle. I don\u2019t want to experience it, [though] I\u2019d love to know what doesn\u2019t qualify me for the role, or what makes Peter, Matt, David or Chris more qualified to play an alien with two hearts than me. With social media there are so many positives, it gives people a voice in places that don\u2019t necessarily have a voice, it gave the #MeToo movement an incredibly powerful voice and it has these positives, but me, as an individual, I just think my narcissistic traits could not cope with that.\n\nHave you spoken to Moffat or any of the past Doctors?\n\nMy casting was announced on a Sunday after the Wimbledon finals, and [former Doctors] Peter Capaldi, Matt Smith, David Tennant and Steven Moffat were made aware of it beforehand. David, who is a friend, said [playing a Doctor] will, \u201cbe like nothing you ever go on, but it is such an experience that you\u2019ll treasure. It\u2019ll go really quick, it won\u2019t seem like it now when you\u2019re in fear of the world about to know what you look like, but it goes so quick and it\u2019s just to be enjoyed because it\u2019s a massive ride.\u201d And when I spoke to Peter and Matt, it was more of those vibes.\n\nWhat are your plans for day-of premiere?\n\nI will probably be very far away! I might turn my phone off so I can just watch it peacefully and take it in and then be very accusatory over WhatsApp, going, \u201cDid you watch it, did you watch it?!\u201d We\u2019ve just spent a year and a half of work carrying on this amazing legacy, and making it our own as well. To know that finally the fans are getting to watch it and potentially reach a new audience that has never seen it before? I think it will be really emotional and I\u2019d like to make that as private as possible, but I\u2019m sure someone will FaceTime me during a crucial bit! And I\u2019ll be like, \u201cAre you not watching?!\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/doctor_who_2_-still_-publicity_-embed_3-_2018.jpg?w=928", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/doctor_who_2_-still_-publicity_-embed_1-_2018.jpg?w=928", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/doctor_who_2_-still_-publicity_-embed_4-_2018.jpg?w=928", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/doctor_who_2_-still_-publicity_-embed_2-_2018.jpg?w=928", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/doctor_who_2_-still_-publicity_-h_2018.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/doctor_who_2_-still_-publicity_-h_2018.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alicia Lutes", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/doctor-who-star-jodie-whittaker-women-are-not-a-genre-1149270/", "title": "\u2018Doctor Who\u2019 Star Jodie Whittaker: \u201cWomen Are Not a Genre\u201d", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Jodie Whittaker wants to be more than a feminist icon as the first woman to play the Doctor on 'Doctor Who.'", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Alicia Lutes", "tags": "Doctor Who, international, Jodie Whittaker", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Doctor Who\u2019 Star Jodie Whittaker: \u201cWomen Are Not a Genre\u201d", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/doctor-who-star-jodie-whittaker-women-are-not-a-genre-1149270/", "description": "Jodie Whittaker wants to be more than a feminist icon as the first woman to play the Doctor on 'Doctor Who.'", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/doctor_who_2_-still_-publicity_-h_2018.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "'Doctor Who' Star Jodie Whittaker: \"Women Are Not a Genre\""}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-10-04T09:40:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-17T22:48:32+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jodie Whittaker wants to be more than a feminist icon as the first woman to play the Doctor on 'Doctor Who.'", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Doctor Who\u2019 Star Jodie Whittaker: \u201cWomen Are Not a Genre\u201d", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/doctor_who_2_-still_-publicity_-h_2018.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1538646028.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
