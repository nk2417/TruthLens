She\u2019s wearing a bespoke Giles Deacon dress, designed to create the impression of being seamless.\n\n\u201cI was thrilled to work with Pippa on her wedding dress,\u201d Deacon said. \u201cThe dress is constructed with a cap sleeve, high neckline and features a corseted bodice with draping to the front and a heart-shaped detail at the back.\n\n\u201cThe bespoke silk cotton lace was hand appliqued to create an illusion of the dress having 'no seams'. The lace bodice is embroidered with pearl detailing over an organza and tulle underskirt, which has layer upon layer to enable a floor sweeping movement.\n\n\u201cIt's a privilege to show the craftsmanship that my team produces in London and a real testament to Pippa's support of British fashion.\u201d\n\n33-year-old party planner Pippa accessorised her dress with a Stephen Jones veil, a Maidenhair Fern tiara and Manolo Blahnik ivory satin shoes.\n\nAround 100 guests were expected and hundreds of royal fans have descended on the quiet village for the occasion, some travelling from the other side of the world especially.\n\nMatthews was previously considered one of the most eligible bachelors in the world, and is reportedly worth \u00a32 billion.\n\nComparisons have also been made between Pippa and her sister Kate\u2019s husbands, some pointing out the \u2018old money\u2019 vs \u2018new money\u2019 distinction.\n\nOn social media, many people are fascinated with the proceedings.\n\nNot everyone is convinced all the fuss is necessary though.\n\nRoyal or not, no doubt people will continue be interested in the marriage of the couple.", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/20/12/gettyimages-685746046.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/20/12/gettyimages-685746046.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/20/12/gettyimages-685746046.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/pippa-middleton-james-matthews-wedding-marriage-royal-ceremony-church-a7746276.html", "title": "Pippa Middleton marries financier fianc\u00e9 James Matthews", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "Love & Sex", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/life-style/love-sex", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "She wore a bespoke Giles Deacon dress", "og": {"updated_time": "2017-05-20T12:10:51.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Everyone is loving the pictures of a party planner marrying a hedge fund manager", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/life-style/love-sex/pippa-middleton-james-matthews-wedding-marriage-royal-ceremony-church-a7746276.html", "type": "article", "description": "She wore a bespoke Giles Deacon dress", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/20/12/gettyimages-685746046.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/20/12/gettyimages-685746046.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-20T12:10:51.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-05-20T12:10:51.000Z", "section": "Lifestyle", "subsection": "Love & Sex", "author_name": "Rachel Hosie", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 442, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 8, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 0, "external_link_count": 0}, "date": "2017-05-20T12:10:51.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Everyone is loving the pictures of a party planner marrying a hedge fund manager", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "She wore a bespoke Giles Deacon dress", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/20/12/gettyimages-685746046.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Wedding\",\"royalty\",\"Pippa Middleton\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495282251.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
