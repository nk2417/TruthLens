Morrison played Emma Swan in the series, while Goodwin played Snow White/Mary Margaret Blanchard. Dallas starred as Prince Charming/David Nolan, and de Ravin played Belle/Lacey.\n\nThe four are the latest former cast members to book returns for the show\u2019s finale. Previously, Tony Amendola, Lee Arenberg, JoAnna Garcia Swisher, Robbie Kay, Sean Maguire, Victoria Smurfit, Keegan Tracy, Beverley Elliott, and Jared Gilmore were all confirmed to appear in the final two episodes.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nABC announced in February that \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u2019s\u201d seventh season would be the show\u2019s last. The seventh season was a creative reboot for the show, which lost core cast members like Morrison when their contracts ended after the sixth season. The show also moved from its longtime Sunday night timeslot to Fridays, where it has suffered a noticeable ratings decline. Season 7 is currently averaging a 0.5 rating in adults 18-49 and 2.4 million viewers, down over 40% in the demo and over 20% in total viewers from Season 6.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-morrison-ginnifer-goodwin.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-morrison-ginnifer-goodwin.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Otterson", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/once-upon-a-time-series-finale-jennifer-morrison-ginnifer-goodwin-josh-dallas-emilie-de-ravin-1202732727/", "title": "\u2018Once Upon a Time\u2019 Series Finale to Bring Back Jennifer Morrison, Ginnifer Goodwin", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"Once Upon a Time\" is bringing back a host of familiar faces for the show's upcoming series finale.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Joe Otterson", "tags": "ABC, Jennifer Morrison, Once Upon A Time", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Once Upon a Time\u2019 Series Finale to Bring Back Jennifer Morrison, Ginnifer Goodwin", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/once-upon-a-time-series-finale-jennifer-morrison-ginnifer-goodwin-josh-dallas-emilie-de-ravin-1202732727/", "description": "\"Once Upon a Time\" is bringing back a host of familiar faces for the show's upcoming series finale.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-morrison-ginnifer-goodwin.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Jennifer Morrison Ginnifer Goodwin"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-21T20:00:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-21T20:00:15+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Once Upon a Time\" is bringing back a host of familiar faces for the show's upcoming series finale.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@joeotterson", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Once Upon a Time\u2019 Series Finale to Bring Back Jennifer Morrison, Ginnifer Goodwin", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-morrison-ginnifer-goodwin.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521662412.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
