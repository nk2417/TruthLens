NBC\u2019s last live musical, \u201cHairspray Live,\u201d drew a 2.3 rating in adults 18-49 and 9 million viewers back in December 2016. It is also up slightly over Fox\u2019s live version of the religious-themed \u201cThe Passion\u201d musical from March 2016, which drew a 1.6 and 6.6 million viewers. However, as \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d ended at 10:23 p.m., its initial numbers will be subject to adjustment later today.\n\nElsewhere on broadcast, a new episode of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d (1.6, 7.4 million) held steady with last week\u2019s Sunday episode. \u201cDeception\u201d (0.8, 4.2 million) ticked up slightly in the demo.\n\nFor CBS, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d (0.7, 8.1 million) unsurprisingly fell from the massive ratings drawn by the Stormy Daniels interview the show aired last week. Freshman drama \u201cInstinct\u201d (0.6, 6.7 million) slipped over 50% in the demo in its third week. \u201cNCIS: New Orleans\u201d (0.8, 7.1 million) and \u201cMadam Secretary\u201d (0.5, 5.7 million) were also down versus last week.\n\nOn Fox, \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d (0.6, 1.5 million) took a hit, while \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d (0.9, 2 million) was even. \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d (0.8, 1.8 million) was down slightly, while \u201cFamily Guy\u201d (0.9, 2.1 million) was even. \u201cLast Man on Earth\u201d (0.6, 1.4 million) was down.\n\nNBC topped the night with a 1.3 rating and 7.4 million viewers. ABC was second in the demo with a 1.2 and third in total viewers with 5.8 million. CBS and Fox tied for third in the demo with a 0.7. CBS was second in viewers with 6.9 million. Fox was fourth in viewers with 1.7 million.\n\nPREVIOUSLY: NBC\u2019s live staging of \u201cJesus Christ Superstar\u201d is among the top shows of Sunday night in the early Nielsen numbers.\n\nThe live musical, which starred John Legend in the title role, averaged a 6.0 rating in Nielsen\u2019s metered market households. That is good enough to tie with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d on CBS in households as well as top ABC\u2019s \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d which drew a 4.5. It is also on par with the 5.9 that NBC\u2019s last live musical, \u201cHairspray Live,\u201d drew back in 2016. \u201cHairspray Live\u201d ultimately drew a 2.3 rating in adults 18-49 and just over 9 million viewers, making it one of the lower-rated live broadcast musicals to date.\n\nRELATED CONTENT", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jesus-christ-superstar-john-legend.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jesus-christ-superstar-john-legend.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Otterson", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/jesus-christ-superstar-nbc-ratings-1202741266/", "title": "TV Ratings: \u2018Jesus Christ Superstar Live\u2019 Tops Easter Sunday With 9.4 Million Viewers", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "UPDATED:\u00a0\"Jesus Christ Superstar Live\" carried NBC to a win in the Nielsen overnight ratings on Easter Sunday.
