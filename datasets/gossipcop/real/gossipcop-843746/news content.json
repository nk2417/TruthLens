It wasn\u2019t the first time it\u2019s been heard on this field \u2013 the band introduced it deep in their 2004 Coachella debut and Prince incorporated it in his storied 2008 set in terrific extended-shred style. But tonight\u2019s rendition \u2013 the main set closer of a 22-song set, which marked the band\u2019s fourth Indio appearance following stellar dual weekends in 2012 \u2013 was epic. When Jonny Greenwood hit the palm mute before the distortion kicked in on the first chorus, it was louder than the sound of a shotgun cocking.\n\nGood damn thing it sounded so tremendous \u2013 unleashing the rare live gem was the necessary cherry on top of a spectacular rally after undergoing unprecedented sound problems, the worst in Coachella headliner history.\n\nRelated Video\n\nThe set began as magically as one might imagine, with bright white pistons of light swirling around the group during airy A Moon Shaped Pool kickoffs \u201cDaydreaming\u201d and the acoustic-led \u201cDesert Island Disk\u201d. But the revelry was halted when, about halfway through third song \u201cFul Stop\u201d, there was an abrupt buzz and pop \u2013 like the sound of a guitar cable coming loose but much louder \u2013 followed by a brief outage. That was forgivable. These things happen, and the band took it in stride (\u201cFucking aliens again,\u201d joked Thom Yorke). But two songs later, well into In Rainbows staple \u201c15 Step\u201d, the sound dropped out once again \u2026 and didn\u2019t come back. The band played through to the end, seemingly unaware, as their fans could hear nothing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter a brief intermission to solve the issue, they roused heartfelt cheers by returning triumphantly with the otherworldly prog-jazz of \u201cThe National Anthem\u201d, and for a moment, as they launched into \u201cLet Down\u201d, it seemed like everything was gonna be OK. But for the first time ever (I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m typing this) that classic OK Computer fave fully lived up to its name \u2013 the sound kicked the bucket mid-song, and one of the biggest collective groans I\u2019ve ever heard at a festival rose up as the band again played through almost the entire track without realizing it was no longer blasting from the speakers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m having audio anxiety,\u201d exclaimed one exasperated fan. \u201cI have an actual fear of the music stopping again.\u201d\n\nFor a moment, it appeared that what should\u2019ve been one of the most landmark sets of the weekend might end up a complete disaster. True, anyone who was on the fence about seeing Radiohead probably bailed at this point \u2013 the audience visibly thinned out by the thousands during the downtime. But over the course of the next hour or so, with all sound issues resolved, Radiohead more than made up for the pauses with a superb set crowned by \u201cCreep\u201d, which was followed by a standout encore of \u201cYou and Whose Army?\u201d \u2013 replete with a larger-than-life close-up of Yorke\u2019s eye, simultaneously the most wonderfully intimate and terribly uncomfortable sight \u2013 alongside the rollicking \u201cBodysnatchers\u201d and galvanic sing-along \u201cKarma Police\u201d.\n\nSound problems like these are cringe-worthy for any fest headliner, but in this case, it worked to the performers\u2019 advantage. The snafu provided a rare glimpse of a more humanized Radiohead \u2013 they\u2019re not as invincible as some people make them out to be, but they still proved some level of omnipotence by persevering with the asset that launched them to stardom in the first place: fucking great rock music.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSetlist:\n\nDaydreaming\n\nDesert Island Disk\n\nFul Stop\n\nAirbag\n\n15 Step\n\nThe
