In one of the photos, Gigi is seen wearing an orange-and-black caftan over a pair of white pants, snuggling up to her boyfriend of two years. In another shot, Zayn receives a kiss on the cheek from his mom while throwing his arm over his sister's shoulder. Gigi's mom, Yolanda Hadid, shared the adorable photo of the couple to her story, too, which may mean that she was also in attendance.\n\nEid al-Adha, which took place on August 20\u201321, is also known as \"The Festival of Sacrifice\" or \"Big Eid,\" and it marks the end of the Hajj. It is one of the most important Muslim holidays of the year. Last year, Gigi and Zayn also celebrated the holiday with their families \u2014 including both of their moms.\n\nAs the daughter of an immigrant (her father, Mohamed Hadid, was born in Israel then lived in Syria and Lebanon before immigrating to the U.S. at age 14), Gigi has been outspoken about her pride in her Muslim roots. She appeared in a 2017 issue of Vogue Arabia wearing a hijab, and marched alongside her sister, Bella Hadid, at a New York City protest condemning Donald Trump's travel ban. In 2015, she posted an image of her hands covered in traditional mehndi to Instagram, captioning it \u201cHalf Palestinian & proud of it.\"\n\nZayn's family has roots in Pakistan, and he has been identified in the past by Britain's Evening Standard as \"the most high-profile British Muslim in the entertainment industry\" \u2014 something he is very proud of. \u201cI take a great sense of pride \u2014 and responsibility \u2014 in knowing that I am the first of my kind, from my background,\u201d he said of the accolade. \u201cI\u2019m not currently practicing, but I was raised in the Islamic faith, so it will always be with me, and I identify a lot with the culture. But I\u2019m just me. I don\u2019t want to be defined by my religion or my cultural background.\u201d", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6902335be1c29f6cd8db22bd/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b7f087dfb2ca45d0406b040/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/shutterstock_8467905do.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/691251f73c97e98bf9922bc6/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a15acadd3645b573a3dd49c/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68fceec7daf24cf1ce68ee66/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/691264c344b56dadab2b775d/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6855545f9550c207fb02e715/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68fcecb5a946b8405aff653c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b7f087dfb2ca45d0406b040/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shutterstock_8467905do.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teenvogue-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/69138d7bbc6eeda96f4c6446/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6912653d5d66753a47afa79e/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6914a80a02261b24bfc3d1dc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6894890bb0414fdff135dbc0/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/68fa3921d42a2cf2f237c104/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6915abc6c6198fed52129484/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b7f087dfb2ca45d0406b040/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shutterstock_8467905do.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zo\u00eb Weiner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/gigi-hadid-zayn-malik-celebrate-eid-with-zayn-family", "title": "Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik Celebrate Eid With Zayn's Family", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Zo\u00eb Weiner", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Model Gigi Hadid and \"Too Much\" singer Zayn Malik celebrated the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha with Zayn's family, and shared photos to Instagram of the event.", "id": "5b7f078c8d65c5660bb1f268", "keywords": "gigi hadid,zayn malik", "news_keywords": "gigi hadid,zayn malik", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b7f078c8d65c5660bb1f268", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Model Gigi Hadid and \\\"Too Much\\\" singer Zayn Malik celebrated the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha with Zayn's family, and shared photos to Instagram of the event.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b7f087dfb2ca45d0406b040/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/shutterstock_8467905do.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b7f087dfb2ca45d0406b040/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/shutterstock_8467905do.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Their families shared sweet pics of the reported couple.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b7f087dfb2ca45d0406b040/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shutterstock_8467905do.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "See How Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik Celebrated Eid", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/gigi-hadid-zayn-malik-celebrate-eid-with-zayn-family"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-08-23T21:03:34.371Z", "modified_time": "2018-08-23T21:03:34.371Z", "author": "Zo\u00eb Weiner"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "Their families shared sweet pics of the reported couple.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b7f087dfb2ca45d0406b040/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/shutterstock_8467905do.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "See How Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik Celebrated Eid"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b7f087dfb2ca45d0406b040/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/shutterstock_8467905do.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1535058214.371, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
