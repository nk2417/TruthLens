It happens often enough, we\u2019re all used to it.\n\nAnd according to Victoria, it\u2019s because the fashion industry has \u201cstolen\u201d her smile and that she doesn\u2019t crack one out out of respect to the industry.\n\nFair.\n\nThis weekend though, Victoria wasn\u2019t lamenting the fact that fashion had stolen her ability to break out her pearly whites.\n\nShe was actually relieved\u2026 because she wasn\u2019t pregnant.\n\nProbably our default state, to be honest.\n\nVictoria told The Evening Standard she was delighted she wasn\u2019t expecting a child at this royal wedding, like she was back in 2011 when she attended Will and Kate\u2019s big day.\n\nShe said:\n\n\u201cQuite honestly, it was such a relief not to be hugely pregnant at this royal wedding that it was a joy to be able to choose anything I wanted to wear.\u201d\n\nVB also recognised that her outfits from both weddings were similar enough, saying: \u201cI love navy.\u201d\n\nFair, girl.\n\nSame.\n\nThe fashion icon went on to say that the wedding was lovely and that she had a great day.\n\nShe said:", "images": ["https://her.ie/uploads/2025/04/colin-farrell.png?height=225&width=450&cropped",
