Kit Harington announced his engagement to his Game of Thrones costar Rose Leslie on September 27, and now we get to see her engagement ring. The 30-year-old actress was spotted at London\u2019s Heathrow airport looking fresh faced with a big diamond on her ring finger.\n\nThe couple has HBO to thank for their relationship. They began dating in 2012 after first meeting on set and playing love interests until (spoiler alert!) Rose\u2019s character, Ygritte, was killed off. Kit, who plays Jon Snow, alluded to a forever future with Rose earlier this year. \u201dYgritte is the only woman for Jon. Always,\u201d he exclusively told Us Weekly in July. \u201cThere will be no one else.\u201d It\u2019s a sentiment his character does not seem to share, having gotten together with Emilia Clarke\u2019s character Daenerys this past season!\n\nRelated: Winter Is Here and So Are These \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Inspired Beauty Products Winter is here and we have just the products to hold you over until the new season of Game of Thrones!\n\nThe couple first hit the red carpet together at the Oliver Awards in London in April 2016, where Rose rocked a red Christian Dior tulle gown from their Spring 2017 collection. The twosome formally announced their engagement in The Times\u2019 \u201cForthcoming Marriages\u201d section.\n\n\u201cMr. K.C. Harington and Miss R.E. Leslie,\u201d the post read. \u201cThe engagement is announced between Kit, younger son of David and Deborah Harington of Worcestershire, and Rose, middle daughter of Sebastian and Candy Leslie of Aberdeenshire.\u201d\n\nRelated: Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington New D&G Campaign Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington are the new faces of Dolce & Gabbana\u2019s The One fragrance.\n\nKit revealed that he actually proposed earlier than he planned to. \u201cI did have some plans to do it, I was going to string up some lights in some trees and do all the romantic stuff\u2026\u201d he told British TV host Jonathan Ross. \u201cBut we were in the country and we were under this beautiful night sky and had a log fire burning and red wine, and I blew my load early.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, that\u2019s a really bad expression!\u201d he quickly added. \u201cI was meant to do it the day after with the lights. What I meant to say was, I popped my question a bit early. Not blew my load.\u201d\n\nRelated: Kit Harington on \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Season 7: Will Jon Snow Find Love?
