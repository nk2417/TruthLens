The \"Tommy Boy\" star may have left us physically on December 18, 1997 ... but his comedic legacy will always stay with us.\n\nIn honor of the legendary entertainer, we had to go back and remember some of his greatest moments, in no particular order.\n\n1. Tommy Boy\n\n\"Tommy Boy\" brought us great lines like \"fat guy in a little coat,\" and one of Farley's most memorable bits about being in sales.\n\n!youtube-embed(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1EyN9xTK94)\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n2. Matt Foley: The Motivational Speaker\n\nIf you've never heard of this famous Farley sketch, then there's a good chance you'll end up ... LIVING IN A VAN DOWN BY THE RIVER!!!\n\n!youtube-embed(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv2VIEY9-A8)\n\nChippendales\n\nThe famous sketch with Patrick Swayze will go down as one of Saturday Night Live's best, although many friends of Farley have said since his death they felt the sketch was painful for him.\n\n!youtube-embed(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jivzl54BfK4)\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n4. Billy Madison\n\nThe angry bus driver was one of the funniest parts in \"Billy Madison.\" \"No Yelling on the bus!!!\"\n\n!youtube-embed(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Chhby5K95HE)\n\nGap Girls\n\nWatching Adam Sandler try to hold himself together when Farley belts out his infamous \"Lay off me I'm starving\" line is pure gold.\n\n!youtube-embed(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmtkNrufSwQ)\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nBonus: Schmitts Gay\n\nI know we said five, but Chris Farley is so amazing that it could hardly be limited.
