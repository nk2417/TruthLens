Their son, Isaiah Michael Fisher, is heard laughing hysterically in the background.\n\n\u201cSounds just like the original,\u201d Underwood wrote in the caption, adding a zany face emoji.\n\nFans loved the funny video, especially Isiah\u2019s laughing in the back.\n\n\u201cHahaha. Too funny. The giggling from backseat is priceless,\u201d one wrote.\n\n\u201cLove hearing that sweet giggle,\u201d added another.\n\nUnderwood shared the adorable family moment the same weekend they celebrated Fisher\u2019s birthday. He turned 38 on Tuesday, but they waited until the weekend since Underwood was busy at the CMA Music Festival. He got a special hat-shaped cake that read \u201cCatchin\u2019 Deers.\u201d\n\nThe singer also performed at the CMT Awards on Tuesday, belting out \u201cCry Pretty\u201d while wearing glitter around her eyes to recreate the song\u2019s single art.\n\n\u201cCry Pretty\u201d is the title track of Underwood\u2019s sixth studio album. The song was written with The Love Junkies, made up of Hillary Lindsey, Lori McKenna and Liz Rose.\n\n\u201cThe first single is a song I love so much and can\u2019t wait to share with you,\u201d Underwood said in a statement in April. \u201cThe title refers to when emotions take over and you just can\u2019t hold them back. It really speaks to a lot of things that have happened in the past year and I hope when you hear it, you can relate those feelings to those times in your life. It\u2019s emotional. It\u2019s real. And it ROCKS!\u201d\n\nCry Pretty the album comes out on Sept. 14. Hopefully Fisher\u2019s version is included as a bonus track.\n\nFisher is an NHL veteran and reached the Stanley Cup Finals with the Nashville Predators after the 2016-17 season. He retired after the series, but returned to the Predators partway through the 2017-18 season. After they lost in the playoffs to the Winnipeg Jets, Fisher announced his plans to retire for good.", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/boston-blue-faith-and-family-sonequa-martin-green-donnie-wahlberg-cbs.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/04/70839b1d-3826-4242-9848-ca2fff9b687f.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/04/45511bc5-8791-4d0b-a2e9-34e9c9011b24.png?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/70afec6a-3143-4947-b047-428e525611d4.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel S.
