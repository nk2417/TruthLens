During the Monday, January 1, premiere of The Bachelor, Arie met the lovely ladies vying for his heart, and as with any installment of the show, the episode was not without its quirks.\n\nReintroducing Arie\n\nThe two-hour premiere began by reacquainting us with Arie, considering he\u2019s been out of Bachelor Nation\u2019s consciousness for five years. We got an abbreviated review of his time on Emily Maynard\u2019s season of The Bachelorette and rehashed his heartbreak. Today, Arie still races cars but also sells real estate. Oddly enough, real estate was one of the most discussed topics of the night \u2026 and if you think that sounds boring, you\u2019re absolutely right.\n\nRelated: The Biggest Surprises of 2017 Babies, engagements and Oscar flubs, oh my! 2017 was full of pop culture moments that left Us shocked. From Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s engagement to Arie Luyendyk Jr. being named The Bachelor, scroll through to relive the biggest surprises of the year. Thank You!

Sean and Arie have been friends since they both appeared on Emily\u2019s season so the former Bachelor shared the generic tips he\u2019s been dishing out for years \u2014 even he admitted they haven\u2019t been working, but apparently, he signed his life over to this franchise a long time ago so it\u2019s too late for him. However, this segment was really all about watching Arie awkwardly hold Samuel. We may have just figured out why he\u2019s still single.\n\nMeet (Some of) the Ladies\n\nNext, we saw short pre-taped intro packages of some of the contestants. The women did a lousy job of pretending to be excited about Arie, but we did learn a couple of interesting tidbits of information.\n\nContestant Tia is friends with Raven Gates \u2014 who competed on Nick Viall\u2019s season of The Bachelor and season 4 of Bachelor in Paradise \u2014 as if you couldn\u2019t tell based solely on their identical accents.\n\nThere\u2019s also a girl who collects taxidermy animals. Kendall called herself a \u201cweird soul\u201d and really drove that point home by singing to a dead seal. You do you, Kendall.\n\nUnforgettable Limo Entrances\n\nThe Bachelor limo entrances seem to get crazier every season, and Arie\u2019s premiere certainly had some doozies \u2014 both of the uniquely sweet and jaw-dropping variety.\n\nMany of the women\u2019s introductions were inspired by Arie\u2019s racing background. Brittane stuck a \u201cnice butt\u201d bumper sticker on The Bachelor\u2019s derriere. Bekah drove a \u201965 cherry red Mustang up to the mansion. Maquel arrived in a race car, and somehow her waves remained intact after she removed her helmet. Ali asked Arie to smell her armpits as a cheeky reference to the many \u201cpit stops\u201d he\u2019s made in his racing career.\n\nRelated: The Bachelor Season 22: Meet Arie\u2019s Bachelorettes Who will get the final rose? Arie Luyendyk Jr.\u2019s season 22 of The Bachelor is quickly approaching and the contestants have officially been announced. The list features 29 women from all over the country \u2014 and it includes a personal stylist, a social media manager and a fitness coach. Scroll down to meet the Bachelorettes [\u2026]\n\nBecca kept it more traditional by luring Arie into a proposal. She guided him down on one knee and prompted him to ask her, \u201cAre you ready to do the damn thing?\u201d Tia, who lives in Weiner, Arkansas, gave a \u201clittle wiener\u201d to Arie, while asking if he had one. Wow. Very uncomfortable. Speaking of uncomfortable, did we mention there are four Laurens this season? We\u2019re not even going to try to learn all those last name initials.\n\nA Villainous First Impression\n\nOnce inside, the women had a chance to talk to Arie so he could get to know them better. Single mom Chelsea was the first to steal the Bachelor away, but according to her, her time was cut short. Chelsea gave off a villainous vibe throughout the night, talking trash about the other women and justifying her behavior by claiming she\u2019s not a rude or competitive person.\n\nMany of her fellow contestants labeled her \u201caggressive\u201d and took issue with her talking to Arie for a second time. She also stole a kiss from him \u2014 this wasn\u2019t the first kiss of the night, though; Brittany T. received the first smooch.\n\nWhether she was teeing herself up as this season\u2019s villain or not, Chelsea\u2019s approach obviously worked because Arie gave her the first impression rose.\n\nRose Ceremony\n\nArie whittled the 29 women down to 21 by the end of the rose ceremony, sending Amber, Jessica, Brittane J., Ali, Bri, Lauren J., Nysha and Olivia home.\n\nRelated: The Bachelorette After the Final Rose: Broken Engagements, Weddings, Babies, and More!
