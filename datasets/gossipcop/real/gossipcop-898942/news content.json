But as the comedian was filling in as guest host for Jimmy Kimmel on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Thursday night, she might have played her strangest character yet: a conspiracy theorist who doesn\u2019t believe in gravity.\n\nTelling the audience that the mainstream media is hiding the truth behind the theory of \u201cgravitivity,\u201d McCarthy argues that the theory\u2019s originator, Sir Isaac Newton, also created the Fig Newtons cookie brand. Jennifer Aniston interrupts her lecture to remind her that people cannot fly, only to be forced into a harness by McCarthy and raised into the air so that the conspiracy theorist can prove her point.\n\nMcCarthy filled in on Thursday night for Kimmel after his son had heart surgery. Other guest hosts this week have included Chris Pratt, Tracee Ellis Ross and Neil Patrick Harris.\n\nCheck out the full segment below.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen_shot_2017-12-08_at_9.56.43_am_-_h_2017_0.jpg?w=928&h=523&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen_shot_2017-12-08_at_9.56.43_am_-_h_2017_0.jpg?w=928&h=523&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Kilkenny", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/watch-melissa-mccarthy-debate-existence-gravity-jennifer-aniston-1065749/", "title": "Watch Melissa McCarthy Debate the Existence of Gravity With Jennifer Aniston", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Filling in for Jimmy Kimmel, McCarthy promised the audience she would address a subject &quot;the mainstream media doesn't want you to hear about.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Katie Kilkenny", "tags": "jennifer aniston, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late Night TV, Melissa McCarthy", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Watch Melissa McCarthy Debate the Existence of Gravity With Jennifer Aniston", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/watch-melissa-mccarthy-debate-existence-gravity-jennifer-aniston-1065749/", "description": "Filling in for Jimmy Kimmel, McCarthy promised the audience she would address a subject \"the mainstream media doesn't want you to hear about.\"", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen_shot_2017-12-08_at_9.56.43_am_-_h_2017_0.jpg?w=928&h=523&crop=1", "width": 928, "height": 523, "alt": "Watch Melissa McCarthy Debate the Existence of Gravity With Jennifer"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-08T10:44:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-08T11:10:06+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Filling in for Jimmy Kimmel, McCarthy promised the audience she would address a subject \"the mainstream media doesn't want you to hear about.\"", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Watch Melissa McCarthy Debate the Existence of Gravity With Jennifer Aniston", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen_shot_2017-12-08_at_9.56.43_am_-_h_2017_0.jpg?w=928&h=523&crop=1"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ncHhjUllA7s"], "publish_date": 1512729897.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
