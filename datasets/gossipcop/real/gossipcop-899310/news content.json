They're in the eye of the hurricane,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey've always got drama, and chaos, and war, and strife, but their relationship is what gives them that sort of bubble that they're in, of heaven. And it allows them to deal with all the crises in their life because they have that central beauty and calm together that makes them a team.\u201d\n\nThe eye of the storm provided another hard-to-spot VFX moment, and Moore\u2019s really hoping that you didn\u2019t pick up on it.\n\n\u201cIn the script, it was sunshine, because they're in the eye of the hurricane. And then as we got into post, we realized it didn't quite feel right that it was such a hard sun,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt more natural that there should still be some rain, it should be a little more overcast. The problem with that was there was no rain hitting the surface of the water. To put that into visual effects ... was going to be so much money and crazy 3-D modeling and not worth it. So we just added some rain over the top, and I was sweating about, \u2018Everyone's going to see that there's no rain hitting that water.\u2019\u201d\n\nUltimately, Moore admits, he remembered a scene in The Hunt for Red October where the main character is being lowered from a helicopter onto a submarine in the middle of a storm, but the surface of the water is calm.\n\n\u201cWhen you throw this rain in front of the camera in post, and you pump up the wind sounds, and the soundtrack, you just want to believe it,\u201d Moore says with a chuckle. \u201cIf you break it down and you really look at it, you go, \u2018Wow, that is not a storm at all,\u2019 but the audience just goes with you. They want to believe it's a storm. They're not looking for the flaws. We look for the flaws.\u201d", "images": ["https://img.youtube.com/vi/2gKUZAKjcDw/maxresdefault.jpg", "https://img.youtube.com/vi/BRqhguzewlQ/maxresdefault.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/images-13.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1697208105.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/images-17.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1697208106.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/images-10.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1697208105.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1619478605.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/images-21.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1697208107.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/images-15.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1697208106.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/images-2.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1697208103.jpg", "https://c.evidon.com/pub/icong1.png", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/images-22.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1697208107.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/images-7.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1697208104.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/images-6.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1697208104.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/images-4.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1697208103.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/images-8.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1697208104.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/images-19.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1697208107.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/images-24.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1697208108.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/images-11.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1697208105.jpg", "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/images-3.fit_lim.size_1400x.v1697208103.jpg"], "top_img": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1619478605.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Executive Producer Toni Graphia"], "canonical_link": "https://mashable.com/feature/outlander-season-3-finale-behind-the-scenes", "title": "Shipwrecked souls: Behind the scenes of Outlander's Season 3 finale", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#00aeef", "application-name": "Mashable.com", "description": "What it's like to bring Claire and Jaime's love story to life.", "fb": {"app_id": 122071082108, "pages": 18807449704}, "og": {"site_name": "Mashable", "title": "Shipwrecked souls: Behind the scenes of Outlander's Season 3 finale", "url": "https://mashable.com/feature/outlander-season-3-finale-behind-the-scenes", "description": "What it's like to bring Claire and Jaime's love story to life.", "image": {"identifier": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1619478605.jpg", "secure_url": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1619478605.jpg", "height": 675, "width": 1200}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Laura Prudom", "published_time": "2017-12-14T12:00:00+00:00", "section": "Entertainment"}, "twitter": {"site": "@mashable", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@mashable", "title": "Shipwrecked souls: Behind the scenes of Outlander's Season 3 finale", "description": "What it's like to bring Claire and Jaime's love story to life.", "image": "https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/longforms/05Fu6Y30b0D8gOYXwMcxWuy/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1619478605.jpg"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513227600.0, "source": "https://mashable.com", "summary": ""}
