In the first, she held her daughter for the first time, and in the second, her son Tripp met baby Sailor.\n\n'First two loves of my life,' she wrote. She has since welcomed a third child, Atlee Bay, her second with ex-marine Dakota.\n\nBut the caption on the third image, which showed her cradling Sailor, took a negative turn.\n\n'Drove myself to and from the hospital to deliver my baby girl,' she wrote.\n\n'I honestly had never felt more alone in my life \u2014 but this will forever be the most defining/empowering moment to me. Thank you Lord.'\n\nThe birth of their daughter Sailor came during a bitter period of estrangement for the couple. At the time of the little girl's birth, Bristol was living in Alaska with her family, while Dakota was thousands of miles away at his home in Kentucky.\n\nThe two had previously been engaged, but called off their wedding just days before it was set to take place.\n\nIn May of 2016, months after Sailor's birth DailyMail.com exclusively revealed that Dakota was fighting for his daughter's last name to be changed from Palin to Meyer.\n\nHe also shared details about the furious custody and visitation battle raging on between the exes, claiming that Bristol had made it incredibly difficult for him to even meet his daughter.\n\nNo more: Bristol and ex-husband Dakota Meyer (pictured in October 2017) settled their divorce this month\n\nWhoops: Single again, Bristol announced her pregnancy with Sailor shortly after she split from Dakota the first time, calling off their wedding\n\nDad: Dakota was not in the picture when she gave birth, but they later got back together and wed in June 2016\n\nAccording to Dakota, Bristol had refused to allow him proper visitations with his child, with the mother insisting that her daughter could not be away for long periods of time because she was being breastfed.\n\nIndeed, the former marine, who was based in Kentucky at the time, did not actually get the chance to see his baby girl in person until March \u2014 three months after her birth \u2014 when he made the 3,600-mile round-trip journey from his home to Anchorage, Alaska, where Bristol was living with her family.\n\nThe turmoil came after after a dramatic breakup earlier in 2015. Bristol and Dakota had initially announced their engagement in March of that year, and had planned a wedding for May 23 when, just days before, it was suddenly called off.\n\nThe wedding cancellation came as news broke that Dakota had been previously married.\n\nThen, on June 25 \u2014 just a month after their nuptials were supposed to have taken place \u2014 Bristol, who gave birth to son Tripp when she was in a relationship with ex-fiance Levi Johnston, took to her blog to announce that she was pregnant.\n\n'I know this has been, and will be, a huge disappointment to my family, to my close friends, and to many of you,' she wrote.\n\n'Tripp, this new baby, and I will all be fine, because God is merciful.'\n\nShe later revealed that the pregnancy was planned because she wanted a bigger family while she was still with Dakota, but she added, 'I got ahead of myself.'\n\nAt the time of the pregnancy announcement, neither Bristol or Dakota confirmed that he was the father of Bristol's unborn child. Both chose to remain quiet up until Sailor was born in December, after they had been separated for seven months.\n\nFamily: Bristol and Dakota went on to have another daughter, Atlee, totaling three kids for the single mom\n\nThey grow up so fast! Sailor is now two and a half\n\nFast: Bristol and Dakota filed for divorce earlier this year after a year and a half of marriage\n\nAfter the little girl's birth, Dakota took to Twitter to finally reveal that he was in fact her biological father, proudly sharing an image of a sleeping Sailor while writing, 'Best Christmas present ever!! I couldn't be more proud of this little blessing.'\n\nThings then took a dramatic and rather bitter turn between the former couple, as they began their furious battle over custody and visitation of the little girl.\n\nBut, surprisingly, the two managed to reconcile, and got back together just a few months after news of the bitter battle had been made public. They then married in a secret June 2016 ceremony.\n\nThey went on to have another daughter, Atlee Bay, in May 2017, before announcing their divorce earlier this year.\n\nBristol's latest post about the birth of their daughter Sailor comes less then one week after Dakota took to Instagram to make some thinly-veiled jabs of his own at his ex.\n\nWhile doing a Q&A on his Insta Stories last Monday, the former marine confessed that he has no plans to marry again, while revealing that he and Bristol split because 'she wasn't happy with him'.\n\nWhen responding to a follower's question about what advice he had for someone going through a divorce, he candidly wrote: 'Take it one day at a time and focus on you.'\n\nCutie: Bristol also shared a cute video of Sailor this weekend\n\nTroublemaker: In it, the little girl says she called the police (though it seems to just be on her walkie-talkie)\n\nShe's on fire! She's dressed in a mini firefighter's uniform\n\n'Everything is just a moment in time. You can try everything and give the person all you have and if they don't choose to see good in you it's out of your control. Know when enough is enough.'\n\nHe also shared some thoughts about how fatherhood has changed him, and even alluded to the fact that he might not have been entirely prepared to take on the responsibility when his first daughter was born.\n\n'Both of my girls have got me through so much but Sailor is what turned me into a man and made me not just want to be better but to make the commitment,' he wrote. 'I'd do whatever it took to be the best dad ever.'\n\nThe online bickering doesn't seem to have bothered Bristol, who is now a single mother-of-three and is set to document her day-to-day life with her children on the upcoming season of Teen Mom.\n\nFuture reality star Bristol found some time to hit the beach over the weekend to enjoy some fun in the sun.\n\nShe uploaded a photo to Instagram showing her sitting on a towel on the beach, wearing a red bikini and jean shorts with a baseball cap and sunglasses. She flaunted her long legs in the snap, which showed her laughing happily at the camera.\n\nBristol also shared a video of her daughter Sailor, which captured the little girl dressed in a firefighter's uniform and using a walkie-talkie.\n\nBristol, off-camera, can be heard asking Sailor if she just called the cops \u2014 presumably in a make-believe way on her walkie-takie \u2014 to which Sailor answers affirmatively.\n\nWhen asked what she said, Sailor says, 'Mommy's being annoying.'\n\n'That's not nice,' Bristol replies, but can't hold in her laughter.", "images":
