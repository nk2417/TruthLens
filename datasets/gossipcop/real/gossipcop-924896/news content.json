News that Edwards \u201cleft voicemail messages threatening to show up at my house and take my son\u201d and alleged her ex \u201chas made threats to show up and hurt me if I don\u2019t answer my phone.\u201d\n\nThe MTV star also alleged that Edwards had appeared at Bentley\u2019s baseball game in May 2017 \u201cunder the influence of heroin and got in my face, yelling and threatening to hurt me,\u201d RadarOnline reported.\n\nBookout wrote in the documents, obtained by RadarOnline, that she feared for her son\u2019s safety and cited Edwards\u2019 driving under the influence as a factor.\n\nJohn Phillips/Getty; Mackenzie Edwards/Instagram\n\nEdwards was previously shown driving impaired during the season 6 finale of Teen Mom OG, while on the way to his wedding with Mackenzie Standifer Edwards, who was seen at times taking the steering wheel from him while on the road.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Teen Mom OG\u2019s Ryan and Mackenzie Standifer Edwards Expecting First Child Together\n\nBookout\u2019s husband, McKinney, also filed for an order of protection against Edwards.

He posted bail a day later, according to TMZ.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?
