He was proud of that.\"\n\n\"I knew he was a womanizer. I wouldn't want to be married to the guy, but that's not my business really,\" he added. \"But this level of criminal sexual predation is not something that I ever thought was going on. Absolutely not.\"\n\nIn an earlier interview with The Wrap, Damon further insisted that he had no idea of the sexual harassment and assault allegations against Weinstein.\n\n\"Everybody's saying we all knew. That's not true,\" he said. \"If there was ever an event that I was at and Harvey was doing this kind of thing and I didn\u2019t see it, then I am so deeply sorry, because I would have stopped it.\"\n\nGeorge Clooney -- Damon's frequent co-star and director of his upcoming movie, Suburbicon -- also told ET that Weinstein had alluded to him that he was having affairs with women that weren't his wife.\n\n\"Harvey would talk about women that he'd, you know, gone out with,\" he said. \"I didn't really necessarily believe that \u2018cause to believe that would believe bad things about actresses that I know and like, and I didn't really buy into that.\"\n\nThe 56-year-old actor said that it's his hope that all the women who have come forward about Weinstein's alleged despicable behavior will further spur others to tell their stories.\n\n\u201cWe have to make sure that now there has to be something good that\u2019s gonna come out of all of this,\" he insisted. \"The thing that\u2019s good that could come out of this is that women feel safer in talking about these situations, and in doing so, that it makes it much harder for men who would behave like this to do it, [knowing] that they'll get outed.\"\n\nCheck out more of ET's interview with Clooney, including him talking about his wife Amal's own experience with sexual harassment in the workplace:", "images":
