In a wide-ranging interview with BuzzFeed, the Oscar-winning actress, who has been heavily involved with the Time\u2019s Up initiative that combats sexual harassment in workplaces across industries, acknowledged a 2009 petition she signed in support of Roman Polanski, the European filmmaker who was convicted of raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977. The petition sprung up after Polanski was arrested in Switzerland and faced possible extradition to the United States. In the interview, Portman says she regrets the decision and didn\u2019t think it through enough before she signed it.\n\n\u201cI very much regret it,\u201d she said. \u201cI take responsibility for not thinking about it enough. Someone I respected gave it to me, and said, \u2018I signed this. Will you too?\u2019 And I was like, sure. It was a mistake. The thing I feel like I gained from it is empathy towards people who have made mistakes. We lived in a different world, and that doesn\u2019t excuse anything. But you can have your eyes opened and completely change the way you want to live. My eyes were not open.\u201d\n\nThe petition was also signed by various other luminaries of the global film industry, including filmmaker Sam Mendes, actor Jeremy Irons, and actress Isabelle Adjani. Portman is one of the first stars to publicly apologize for it.\n\nThe actress also spoke candidly about her vocal support of Dylan Farrow, who has repeatedly claimed that her father, Woody Allen, sexually abused her as a child. (Allen has repeatedly denied the claims.) \u201cI think there\u2019s a direct connection between believing women about their own experience and allowing women to be experts of their own experience and every woman\u2019s voice being heard,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s someone talking about their work and not being listened to, or someone talking about their own experience of assault and being told that they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, I think there\u2019s a direct connection between that. Of course, do I know anyone's experience? No. But would I question a man who said \u2018someone stabbed me\u2019? Never! You know? I think it\u2019s bizarre.\u201d\n\nPortman, who\u2019s on the press circuit promoting the upcoming sci-fi film Annihilation, also addressed the whitewashing complaints that have dogged the film. In the novel on which the film is based, Portman\u2019s character is half Asian and Jennifer Jason Leigh\u2019s character is part Native American. In a previous interview, both actresses said they were unaware of their characters\u2019 original ethnic backgrounds, though Portman added that casting them in these roles \u201cdoes sound problematic.\u201d She expounded on that issue in the BuzzFeed interview, saying it felt \u201cterrible\u201d and \u201creally unfortunate\u201d to discover the issues with the film, which also stars Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, and Tuva Novotny. Portman finished by addressing Hollywood\u2019s greater issues with representing women of color.", "images":
