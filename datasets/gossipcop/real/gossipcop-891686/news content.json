Our businesses are open 24/7 and, of course, we\u2019re always working and grinding. But then I started talking to her and then realised, very quickly, just how wrong I was.\"\n\nOhanian co-founded the news website Reddit in 2005 and became a multi-millionaire aged 23 when he sold it 16 months later. He met Williams at a cafe in Italy in 2015 and improved the tennis ace's website with a superior \"tech strategy\" while also helping secure \"deal flows with sponsorships and investments.\"\n\nThe pair got married in 2017 and Ohanian said Williams has inspired him in business.\n\n\"It's a front row seat to greatness and that is what I\u2019m working towards in my own career,\" he said.\n\nOhanian and Williams had a daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., in September last year. Since then, Williams has returned to tennis and almost captured her first major since being a mom, what would have been her 24th Grand Slam title, when she reached the 2018 Wimbledon Championships final \u2014 but she missed out to Angelique Kerber.\n\nOhanian co-founded Initialized Capital in 2010, is an Open Internet activist (an advocate for net neutrality), and is widely regarded as \"one of the most creative people in business.\"", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/5b60624542e1cc27421cfdeb?width=700", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5b60624542e1cc27421cfdea?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5b60624542e1cc27421cfdea?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alan Dawson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/alexis-ohanian-marriage-to-serena-williams-is-a-front-row-seat-to-greatness-2018-7", "title": "Serena Williams inspires her Reddit co-founder husband's career in tech \u2014 and he says his marriage is 'a front row seat to greatness'", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Serena Williams inspires her Reddit co-founder husband's career in tech \u2014 and he says his marriage is 'a front row seat to greatness'", "datePublished": "2018-07-31T13:19:00.000Z", "dateModified": "2018-08-03T13:19:40.000Z", "news_keywords": "Serena Williams, Tennis, Reddit", "description": "Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian says he learned a lot about working hard and 'grinding' when he started talking to tennis champion Serena Williams.", "author": "Alan Dawson", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "og": {"title": "Serena Williams inspires her Reddit co-founder husband's career in tech \u2014 and he says his marriage is 'a front row seat to greatness'", "description": "Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian says he learned a lot about working hard and 'grinding' when he started talking to tennis champion Serena Williams.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/alexis-ohanian-marriage-to-serena-williams-is-a-front-row-seat-to-greatness-2018-7", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/5b60624542e1cc27421cfdea?width=1200&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"psvp": "c"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "5b60624642e1cc27421cfdec", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"tags": "Page Type:story"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2025-05", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
