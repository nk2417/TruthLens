(Avengers 4 \u2014 the follow-up to Avengers: Infinity War, the end of which would seem to have significant implications for the characters on TV's S.H.I.E.L.D. \u2014 hits theaters next May.) \"Whatever they [at Marvel Studios] have planned, I cannot say,\" she hedged.\n\nAs for speculation that Season 6, being S.H.I.E.L.D.'s first-ever shortened run, will serve as the show's swan song, Dungey told me, \"I feel like Season 5 was their creatively strongest yet, so I don't at the moment have any plans to think of Season 6 as the last season.\"\n\nIn fact, the summertime schedule could extend the show's life span.\n\n\"What we've discovered is that we have a very loyal and passionate fan base for S.H.I.E.L.D. The show does incredibly well for us in delayed viewing,\" Dungey explained. \"By putting it in the summer, we're going to be able to 'super-serve' the fan base that loves that show and hopefully give it an opportunity to continue on longer than we would if it was [scheduled] in-season.\"\n\nAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D. airs its Season 5 finale this Friday at 9/8c.", "images": ["https://www.tvline.com/img/TVLine-Icon-RGB-Default-Color.svg", "https://www.tvline.com/img/TVLine-Logo-RGB-Default-Color.svg", "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/news/agents-of-shield-season-6-summer-2019-946969/agents-of-shield-5x11-coulson.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/news/agents-of-shield-season-6-summer-2019-946969/agents-of-shield-5x11-coulson.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matt Webb Mitovich"], "canonical_link": "https://www.tvline.com/news/agents-of-shield-season-6-summer-2019-946969/", "title": "'Agents Of SHIELD' Season 6 Delayed, To Air Summer 2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "thumbnail": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/news/agents-of-shield-season-6-summer-2019-946969/agents-of-shield-5x11-coulson.jpg", "description": "The Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. better hope the Lighthouse is stocked up on sunblock.\u00a0 ABC's Marvel drama, which over the weekend was renewed for a shortened,&hellip;", "mrf": {"tags": "Content Type:Legacy Article;Primary Category:Television;Category:Television;Headline Approver:Unknown;Trello Board:Legacy"}, "og": {"site_name": "TVLine", "title": "Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D.
