The session featured student performances as well as a Q&A among students and the artists in attendance, moderated by renowned journalist Grecia Lopez.\n\nCelebrating its centennial anniversary, Las Vegas High School in Sunrise Manor, Nevada, is recognized as the longest-standing high school in the state. The school boasts a rich arts program centered on showcasing the diversity of storytelling through various mediums including the music program featuring an internationally recognized mariachi band. The investment will further enable the school to develop its music program and acquire new instruments, offering more students the opportunity to pursue the arts.\n\nSLAM Nevada is a tuition-free, public charter school for K-12 students. The investment will allow the music program, launched five years ago, to continue flourishing, with the vision of introducing novice elementary students to music education and building enthusiasm through the curriculum as they approach middle and high school. The program will further enable the school to acquire more instruments, allowing students to take them home during the season for continued practice, thus generating added opportunities for performances.\n\nThe program was presented in partnership with the Dr. Simi Foundation and Sony Music Group, as part of the company\u2019s Beyond The Instrument initiative. In addition, Dollar Tree joined the celebration as an Official Sponsor, with additional support from Gibson Gives and Sweetwater.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important to give back to the next generation of music makers and encourage them to follow their dreams the same way I followed mine,\u201d said Barrera. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m truly honored to partner with The Latin Recording Academy on initiatives like this, which help inspire, educate, and empower the future of Latin music.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing here with these students feels special because I see myself in them. I also started dreaming just like they are, without knowing where I could go, but with a strong desire to sing and tell real stories,\u201d said \u201cEl Flaco.\u201d \u201cMusic taught me that the most important thing is to sing from the heart and never forget where you\u2019re from. If there\u2019s one thing I want them to take away from today, it\u2019s that dreams can come true when you pursue them with passion, discipline, and humility.\u201d\n\n\u201cEstar aqu\u00ed con estos estudiantes es algo muy especial porque me veo reflejado en ellos. Yo tambi\u00e9n empec\u00e9 so\u00f1ando al igual que ellos, sin saber hasta d\u00f3nde pod\u00eda llegar, pero con muchas ganas de cantar y de contar historias reales\u201d, dijo \u201cEl Flaco\u201d. \u201cLa m\u00fasica me ense\u00f1\u00f3 que lo m\u00e1s importante es cantar con el coraz\u00f3n y nunca olvidar de d\u00f3nde vienes. Si algo quiero que se lleven hoy, es que los sue\u00f1os s\u00ed se cumplen cuando los trabajas con pasi\u00f3n, disciplina y humildad\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be at Latin GRAMMY In The Schools representing Mexican music,\u201d said Maydon. \u201cMusic has given me everything, and being here in front of these students reminds me of my beginnings and the importance of never giving up. Seeing their passion inspires me to keep working and to open more doors for future generations.\u201d\n\n\u201cLas Vegas High School greatly appreciates the support of the Latin GRAMMY Cultural Foundation and the instruments the Foundation provided for our students. Without this help, it would be a struggle to provide instruments and equipment for our 700 performing arts students,\u201d said Stephen Blanco, Mariachi Director at Las Vegas High School.\n\n\u201cAt SLAM Nevada, we are incredibly honored to receive this generous gift from the Latin GRAMMY Cultural Foundation and its partners. Our community is deeply grateful for this opportunity, which will allow our students to grow musically, find their voices, and express themselves through the power of music. This investment inspires our mission to open doors for every student to discover their talent, creativity, and confidence both inside and outside the classroom,\u201d said the SLAM Nevada Administration Team.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re grateful to all our partners for allowing us to offer this unique opportunity to the students of Las Vegas High School and SLAM Nevada,\u201d said Raquel \u201cRocky\u201d Egusquiza, Executive Director of the Latin GRAMMY Cultural Foundation. \u201cIt\u2019s inspiring to see both institutions\u2019 work in fostering music education at all levels, from elementary through high school. This support not only fuels their passion for the arts but also prepares them for a future in the industry.\u201d\n\nSince its inception, the Latin GRAMMY In The Schools program has benefited educational institutions in various cities across the United States, including Aransas Pass, Dallas, Detroit, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, New York, and San Antonio, as well as internationally in Buenos Aires, Argentina; Mexico City, Mexico; Panama City, Panama, Arecibo, Humacao, Yauco, and San Juan in Puerto Rico; and Sevilla, Spain.\n\nLatin GRAMMY In The Schools is an educational program that informs and connects music students with professionals in the Latin music industry, supporting educational music departments that face financial limitations. The Foundation invites professional musicians, artists, and sound engineers to visit middle and high schools, universities, or music education institutions and share their personal stories and experiences with students, highlighting the effort it takes to overcome career obstacles. The goal is for students to learn to optimize the educational opportunities presented to them, giving them an advantage and strong academic preparation to be able to compete in the music industry.\n\nAmong the artists who have participated in this program are: \u00c1ngela Aguilar, David Bisbal, Marilina Bertoldi, Miguel Bos\u00e9, Calle 13, Pedro Cap\u00f3, Camilo, Chino & Nacho, Chiquis, Luis Coronel, Silvestre Dangond, Erika Ender, Joss Favela, Fonseca, Luis Fonsi, El Fantasma, Becky G, Karol G, Kany Garc\u00eda, Gente de Zona, Leslie Grace, Carlos Jean, Jesse & Joy, Natalia Lafourcade, Poncho Liz\u00e1rraga, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Mau y Ricky, Claudia Montero, Ednita Nazario, Christian Nodal, Laura Pausini, \u00c1ngel \"Cucco\" Pe\u00f1a, Mireya Ramos, Prince Royce, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Noel Scharjris, Olga Ta\u00f1\u00f3n, Thal\u00eda, Christian Serratos, Diego Torres, Carlos Vives, Wisin, and Sebasti\u00e1n Yatra.\n\n###\n\nABOUT EDGAR BARRERA:\n\nAs a producer, songwriter, and overall creative force, Edgar Barrera has helped push Latin music into the mainstream.

He also recently wrapped up his first headlining tour across the US.\n\nABOUT THE LATIN GRAMMY CULTURAL FOUNDATION:\n\nThe Latin GRAMMY Cultural Foundation is a 501(c)(3) charitable organization established by The Latin Recording Academy\u00ae with the vision of becoming a global champion of music education and empowering communities through Latin music and culture.
