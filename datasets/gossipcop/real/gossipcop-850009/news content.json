Its most recent episode netted 3.5 mil/1.0.\n\nThis marks ABC's fifth comedy renewal for the 2018-19 season, following pickups for Modern Family, Speechless, The Goldbergs and Roseanne. Still awaiting word on their fate are Alex, Inc., American Housewife, black-ish and Fresh Off the Boat.\n\nSplitting Up Together wraps its freshman run on Tuesday, May 22.
