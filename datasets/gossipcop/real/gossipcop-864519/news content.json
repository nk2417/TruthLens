I\u2019ve considered doing Saturday night\u2019s show but it\u2019s highly unlikely I\u2019d even make it through the set and I simply can\u2019t crumble in front of you all and walk out on you in that way.\u201d\n\nThe singer\u2019s 123-date tour in support of her 2015 LP 25 was set to conclude with a four-night stand at Wembley Stadium. However, following the first two shows \u2013 which Adele called \u201cthe biggest and best shows of my life\u201d \u2013 the singer \u201cstruggled vocally\u201d and had to \u201cpush a lot harder than I normally do.\u201d\n\nAdele visited a throat doctor who found damage to her vocal cords; \u201con medical advice,\u201d the singer was told not to perform this weekend, although she \u201ceven considered miming\u201d in order to keep her obligations.\n\n\u201cI have changed my life drastically in every way to make sure I got through this tour that started at the beginning of last year,\u201d Adele wrote. \u201cTo not be able to finish it, is something I\u2019m really struggling to come to terms with.\u201d\n\nAdele, who previously underwent vocal cord surgery in October 2011, added that she hopes to reschedule the two shows in the future, but if she can\u2019t, refunds will be available.\n\nThe cancelled Wembley dates come just a day after Adele hinted that she may not tour again following the 25 jaunt.\n\nRead Adele\u2019s entire note to fans below:", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-802754842-5149a28b-e39a-4a3b-8d34-2a5034c1421a.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-802754842-5149a28b-e39a-4a3b-8d34-2a5034c1421a.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Kreps", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/adele-cancels-remainder-of-tour-after-damaging-vocal-cords-253164/", "title": "Adele Cancels Remainder of Tour After Damaging Vocal Cords", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Adele has canceled the remaining two dates of her massive world tour \u2013 a pair of shows at London's Wembley Stadium \u2013 after damaging her vocal cords.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Daniel Kreps", "tags": "Adele", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Adele Cancels Remainder of Tour After Damaging Vocal Cords", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/adele-cancels-remainder-of-tour-after-damaging-vocal-cords-253164/", "description": "Adele has canceled the remaining two dates of her massive world tour \u2013 a pair of shows at London's Wembley Stadium \u2013 after damaging her vocal cords.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-802754842-5149a28b-e39a-4a3b-8d34-2a5034c1421a.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "alt": "d"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-01T01:19:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T13:39:25+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Adele has canceled the remaining two dates of her massive world tour \u2013 a pair of shows at London's Wembley Stadium \u2013 after damaging her vocal cords.", "site": "@RollingStone", "creator": "@danielkreps", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Adele Cancels Remainder of Tour After Damaging Vocal Cords", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-802754842-5149a28b-e39a-4a3b-8d34-2a5034c1421a.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498871955.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
