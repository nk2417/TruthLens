For those who are out of the loop, there is a reason why Captain Marvel is in this costume.\n\nWhile it looks weird for some, it is actually not a deviation from the comics. Savvy comic book readers will recognize that the color scheme matches the old costume by the original Captain Marvel, aka Mar-Vell, before he switched it out for a red and blue one. According to reports, Carol Danvers herself donned a similar suit before she upgraded it to the most recognizable gear.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the first Kree uniform! Then she upgraded it to the iconic red/yellow/blue!!!! MY HEART ITS HAPPENING #CaptainMarvel pic.twitter.com/zJLq78wnd6 \u2014 Captain Marvel News\n\nIt remains to be seen how Danvers gets the suit in the film. But, in theory, it could be her initial costume when she first receives her alien superpowers. \"Captain Marvel\" will take place partially in the 1990s, before the age of heroes and before Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) lost his left eye. Danvers' modern look will show up at a later point in the movie.\n\nCo-directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck in a screenplay written by Meg LeFauve and Nicole Perlman, \"Captain Marvel\" will be the first superhero film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) to feature a female lead. Apart from Larson and Jackson, the buzzy blockbuster also stars Jude Law as Mar-Vell, and Ben Mendelsohn and DeWanda Wise in top-secret roles. The film is scheduled for release on March 8, 2019.\n\nWhether or not Larson will debut as the character in this May 4's \"Avengers: Infinity War\" is unclear, but she is definitely joining the squad in the upcoming \"Avengers 4.\" The MCU Phase 3 capper will hit theaters on May 3, 2019.", "images": ["https://www.christiantoday.com/media/cache/thumbnail/14/40/144024sp_109w_62h_1x_1y.jpg", "https://www.christiantoday.com/media/cache/thumbnail/14/40/144032sp_109w_62h_1x_1y.jpg", "https://www.christiantoday.com/media/cache/thumbnail/14/40/144039sp_287w_162h_1x_1y.png", "https://www.christiantoday.com/media/cache/img/9/79/97937sp_109w_62h_612x_457y.jpg", "https://www.christiantoday.com/media/cache/thumbnail/14/40/144017sp_109w_62h_1x_1y.jpg", "https://www.christiantoday.com/assets/images/icon/CT-subscribe-nobg-2.svg", "https://www.christiantoday.com/media/cache/thumbnail/14/40/144037sp_287w_162h_1x_1y.jpg", "https://www.christiantoday.com/assets/images/icon/CT_logo-white.svg", "https://www.christiantoday.com/media/cache/img/9/83/98327sp_109w_62h_329x_210y.jpg", "https://www.christiantoday.com/assets/images/icon/CT_logo.svg", "https://www.christiantoday.com/media/cache/img/9/57/95708sp_109w_62h_50x_31y.jpg", "https://www.christiantoday.com/media/cache/img/9/83/98319sp_109w_62h_303x_167y.png", "https://www.christiantoday.com/media/cache/thumbnail/14/40/144035sp_287w_162h_1x_1y.jpg", "https://www.christiantoday.com/media/cache/thumbnail/14/40/144002sp_109w_62h_1x_1y.jpg", "https://www.christiantoday.com/media/cache/thumbnail/14/40/144018sp_109w_62h_1x_1y.png", "https://www.christiantoday.com/media/cache/thumbnail/14/40/144038sp_287w_162h_1x_1y.jpg", "https://www.christiantoday.com/media/cache/thumbnail/14/39/143995sp_109w_62h_1x_1y.png", "https://www.christiantoday.com/media/original/thumbnail/12/47/124752.png"], "top_img": "https://www.christiantoday.com/media/original/thumbnail/12/47/124752.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Necta Casiple"], "canonical_link": "https://www.christiantoday.com/news/captain-marvel-spoilers-brie-larsons-costume-debuts-online-but-isnt-what-fans-expected", "title": "'Captain Marvel' spoilers: Brie Larson's costume debuts online but isn't what fans expected", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "p": {"domain_verify": "edb0984d11c94fc2828120186bade850"}, "keywords": "captain marvel,Captain Marvel set photos,Captain Marvel spoilers,Captain Marvel news,Captain Marvel cast,Captain Marvel Brie Larson", "description": "Larson was photographed in her superhero costume recently, but it is not her iconic red, blue, and gold suit.
