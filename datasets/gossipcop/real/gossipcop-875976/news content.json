It\u2019s a gel. Say I wanted to do a ponytail and I wanted to do something really slick, I\u2019d just put that on the edges. It makes it like rock solid.\u201d He explained while conducting a hair demonstration for the entertainment channel.\n\nGorilla Snot is a sticky yellow hair gel, known as the \u201cbest kept secret\u201d for steamrolling flyaways and keeping braids tight.\n\nAnd with a bit of rooting, we have found the product and surprisingly it\u2019s only \u20ac2.12. Celebrity hair for \u20ac2? YES PLEASE.\n\n\u201cIf you want to make sure that ponytail is super sleek use a tiny little drop of it\u201d Appleton added as his top tip for recreating the singers look.\n\nThe product is available on Target here and ships to Ireland for \u20ac12.86.", "images": ["https://her.ie/uploads/2025/04/colin-farrell.png?height=225&width=450&cropped",
