Just ask Robert De Niro, or David Letterman, or Katy Perry.\n\nStars with brand names are more in demand than ever as dozens of competing outlets search for anything that will help a show stand out from the pack. The new business models that govern streaming services have also had the effect of raising upfront payments to top talent because traditional forms of generating a profit from a hit series \u2014 through international sales and off-network syndication \u2014 are no longer an option.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAmong the winners in the past year on the drama side were Robert De Niro, who is in line to receive an eye-popping $775,00 per episode for the untitled Amazon drama series from director David O. Russell. Other big gainers include \u201cShameless\u201d stars Emmy Rossum and William H. Macy and the \u201cOzark\u201d duo of Jason Bateman and Laura Linney.\n\nOn the flip side, lesser-known actors such as Justin Hartley and Chrissy Metz started out with modest (by comparison) episodic fees for the first season of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d although they are surely poised to add more zeroes in the future. Claire Foy has been collecting awards and praise for her work as Queen Elizabeth II in Netflix\u2019s \u201cThe Crown,\u201d but her Season 1 episodic fee reflects the markedly lower pay scales for British productions.\n\nHere\u2019s a sampling of estimates for the paychecks banked by some of TV\u2019s most notable stars. In some cases, the per episode fees reflect additional compensation for their work as producers or for their profit participation stakes.\n\nDRAMA ACTOR SHOW/NETWORK Per-Episode Estimate Robert De Niro Untitled David O.

The versatile superstar has become one of TV\u2019s highest-paid comedy players thanks to the success of HBO\u2019s \u201cBallers.\u201d Meanwhile, Donald Glover is betting on the long-tail theory with his FX series \u201cAtlanta,\u201d agreeing to more modest fees upfront in exchange for a larger share of the backend.\n\nThe \u201cWill & Grace\u201d quartet of Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Megan Mullally and Sean P. Hayes are back in the top echelon for the NBC revival series. The \u201cModern Family\u201d and \u201cBig Bang Theory\u201d troupes had high-profile contract negotiations that plumped some paychecks. But it\u2019s not all about the money. The original five stars of \u201cBig Bang\u201d agreed to slight pay cuts to help fund raises for their co-stars Mayim Bialik and Melissa Rauch.\n\nCOMEDY ACTOR SHOW/NETWORK Per-Episode Estimate Kaley Cuoco The Big Bang Theory/CBS $900,000 Johnny Galecki The Big Bang Theory/CBS $900,000 Simon Helberg The Big Bang Theory/CBS $900,000 Kunal Nayyar The Big Bang Theory/CBS $900,000 Jim Parsons The Big Bang Theory/CBS $900,000 Dwayne Johnson Ballers/HBO $650,000 Mayim Bialik The Big Bang Theory/CBS $500,000 Julie Bowen Modern Family/ABC $500,000 Ty Burrell Modern Family/ABC $500,000 Jesse Tyler Ferguson Modern Family/ABC $500,000 Ed O\u2019Neill Modern Family/ABC $500,000 Melissa Rauch The Big Bang Theory/CBS $500,000 Eric Stonestreet Modern Family/ABC $500,000 Sofia Vergara Modern Family/ABC $500,000 Jeffrey Tambor Transparent/Amazon $275,000 Roseanne Barr Roseanne/ABC $250,000 John Goodman Roseanne/ABC $250,000 Sean P.

Enough to pay him an estimated $2 million per episode for a six-episode commitment for an in-depth interview series. That number has sent jaws dropping throughout the unscripted TV community. So did Katy Perry\u2019s deal to preside as a judge over ABC\u2019s new iteration of \u201cAmerican Idol.\u201d Nevertheless, it\u2019s two daytime syndication stars who pace the race for big paychecks among reality, news and host talent. DeGeneres has seen her salary and profit participation on \u201cEllen\u201d soar in recent years. \u201cJudge Judy\u201d boss Judith Sheindlin is right behind her, and she stands to reap another eight-figure check this year on the sale of the show\u2019s library to CBS.\n\nREALITY/NEWS/HOST ACTOR SHOW/NETWORK ANNUAL SALARY ESTIMATE Ellen DeGeneres The Ellen DeGeneres Show /Syndicated $50m Judith Sheindlin Judge Judy/Syndicated $47m Matt Lauer Today/NBC $25m Katy Perry American Idol/ABC $25m Kelly Ripa Live With Kelly & Ryan/Syndicated $22m Megyn Kelly NBC News $18m Robin Roberts Good Morning America/ABC $18m Jimmy Fallon The Tonight Show/NBC $16m Stephen Colbert The Late Show/CBS $15m Jimmy Kimmel Jimmy Kimmel Live/ABC $15m Pat Sajak Wheel of Fortune/Syndicated $15m Ryan Seacrest Live With Kelly & Ryan/Syndicated $15m George Stephanopoulos ABC News $15m Anderson Cooper CNN $12m David Letterman Untitled interview show/Netflix* $12m Conan O\u2019Brien Conan/TBS $12m Ryan Seacrest American Idol/ABC $12m Alec Baldwin Match Game/ABC $3m Jamie Foxx Beat Shazam/Fox $3m Mike Myers The Gong Show/ABC $3m Note: Some of these figures include fees for producing and back-end compensation.\n\n*Netflix has ordered six episodes of the series\n\n(Pictured: Dwayne Johnson, Robert De Niro, Emilia Clarke and David Letterman)", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tv-stars-salary-survay-who-makes-the-most.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tv-stars-salary-survay-who-makes-the-most.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cynthia Littleton", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/tv-star-salaries-revealed-2017-robert-de-niro-david-letterman-ellen-degeneres-1202534375/", "title": "TV Salaries Revealed, From Ellen DeGeneres to Katy Perry and The Rock", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Here's what the top stars in TV comedy, drama, and reality and news are getting paid in 2017.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Cynthia Littleton", "tags": "Big Bang Theory, David Letterman, Game of Thrones, Robert De Niro", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "TV Salaries Revealed, From Ellen DeGeneres to Katy Perry and The Rock", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/tv-star-salaries-revealed-2017-robert-de-niro-david-letterman-ellen-degeneres-1202534375/", "description": "Here's what the top stars in TV comedy, drama, and reality and news are getting paid in 2017.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tv-stars-salary-survay-who-makes-the-most.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "TV Stars Salary Survay Who Makes the Most"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-22T13:00:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-22T22:41:26+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Here's what the top stars in TV comedy, drama, and reality and news are getting paid in 2017.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@Variety_Cynthia", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "TV Salaries Revealed, From Ellen DeGeneres to Katy Perry and The Rock", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/tv-stars-salary-survay-who-makes-the-most.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503406809.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
