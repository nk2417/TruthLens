The memory of Carrie Fisher had curled up here on Thursday morning, at the start of Star Wars Celebration, the semi-regular Lucasfilm-organized \u201clove letter\u201d to its fans, though by the end of the opening ceremonies, a \u201cStar Wars\u201d family reunion of cast and crew, Fisher loomed largest. Princess Leia ruled over the Orange County Convention Center.\n\nA large man in a knitted Leia side-bun wig rumbled past. Then Leia-themed T-shirts reading \u201cDon\u2019t Mess With the Princess\u201d and \u201cRebel.\u201d Fisher\u2019s head, given David Bowie lightening bolts, adorned dresses. There were grandmothers and infants in white flowing robes. And at the reunion, the series\u2019 40th, George Lucas\u2019 voice wavered for a moment, croaking out that Fisher was a \u201cmodern woman\u201d; Billie Lourd, the actress\u2019 daughter, recited one of her mother\u2019s \u201cStar Wars\u201d speeches as if it were prayer; and by the end, after Williams silenced thousands with a single finger and the Orlando Philharmonic finished Leia\u2019s lilting theme, the sobs and sighs and sniffles could be heard in the dark.\n\nWhich, if you\u2019re Mark Hamill, also known as Luke Skywalker, and you\u2019re hosting your own tribute to your movie sister, begs the question: What\u2019s left to say about Fisher?\n\nOn Friday night, before a packed hall, Hamill, now 65, walked out and sat in a large fluffy chair and, without much of a warm-up or the usual welcoming niceties, just said:\n\n\u201cHere was something I was hoping wouldn\u2019t come for another 30 years.\u201d\n\nHe stared out at the silent audience.\n\nHe said he had been trying to deal with Fisher\u2019s death in December. He said he wanted to be here to help him deal with it, that speaking to fans might be cathartic. He said she had been at every Star Wars Celebration and she would have been here again. He said that he looked up the definition of \u201ctribute\u201d and then, fumbling a bit, he just told stories.\n\nWhen they were told by Lucas that Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia were actual twins, \u201cI was stunned,\u201d Hamill said. \u201cI\u2019m five years older than Carrie. I said \u2018Wait a minute, if I\u2019m Luke Skywalker from a moisture farm on Tatooine, does that make me royalty?\u2019 And without missing a beat, Carrie said \u2018No!\u2019 And I said \u2018OK, OK, just asking!'\u201d\n\nHe pointed out she had been Hollywood royalty, the daughter of Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher, and he came from a middle-class family. But in fame, Hamill and Fisher were kin, destined to be forever remembered as pop creations, as contemporary mythology, but they embraced their destines with a wink and a boundless respect. Unlike Harrison Ford, who played Han Solo and never seemed comfortable by the intensity of the fandom (or the inevitability of being forever conjoined with a character), Hamill and Fisher made it fun and warm; indeed, you need only look as far as Hamill\u2019s own Instagram account for evidence of an actor incapable of phoning in appreciation.\n\nWhat he gave was a true eulogy, referring to notes and then, simply talking. It was a lovely ramble of a memorial. He said she was a joy to be around \u201cmost of the time,\u201d that he could have never handled her as a girlfriend, that she helped find him an apartment once, that she would force him into crazy outfits and parade him around the studio lot and he would go along with it. He was generous and candid and intimate, a good mimic, a friend at the edge of his seat, recalling memories for a couple of thousand confidants.\n\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR\n\nThere was that time shooting \u201cReturn of the Jedi\u201d and they were suspended on space bikes for hours when Fisher pulled out copies of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, and a highlight marker, and read.\n\n\u201cI said \u2018Carrie, why bring Kierkegaard onset when you have National Inquirer in your trailer?\u2019 She said, \u2018Because I want them to think I\u2019m smart!'\u201d\n\nThere was that time, more recently, when he suggested they pose with their wax figures at Madame Tussaud\u2019s in London and she never replied then posted a picture on Twitter posing with a wax Princess Leia. He complained to her, and said that he thought they would do it together and she said, dismissively, \u201cThat\u2019s a great idea, you should do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I read the script (for \u201cStar Wars\u201d) I thought nothing defines this princess more than this: We risk our lives and board this technical marvel of a Death Star and get her back to the Millennium Falcon and she says (looking at the ship), \u2018You came in that?'\u201d\n\nHe said she was that person.\n\nThere were also tributes from Lucas, and Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy, and new \u201cStar Wars\u201d director Rian Johnson and even Warwick Davis, who played an Ewok. But Hamill had the knowledge of a person that shapes how we remember a person. He believed she would have been a great older actress, and that there was a long time when they didn\u2019t speak, and he never knew for sure when things were OK or not \u2014 he likened it to being in a band that \u201csupernovas\u201d then breaks up for a while. He recited a few lyrics from the Kink\u2019s \u201cCelluloid Heroes\u201d:\n\nI wish my life was a non-stop Hollywood movie show\n\nA fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes\n\nBecause celluloid heroes never feel any pain\n\nAnd celluloid heroes never really die\n\nHe said she was 19 when they met and he was \u201ca worldly 24.\u201d Reading the statement he made after she died, his old Luke Skywalker yelp, there but rougher, cracked. He held a fist to his face, fighting tears, and said it was an honor to know her, \u201cmy beloved space-twin.\u201d But he said that she promised, if he died before her, she would heckle his funeral. \u201cWhen I think of her now, I think of her looking from the celestial stratosphere with her big brown eyes and that wry smile and\u2026 she lovingly extends a middle finger.\n\n\u201cAnd that was Carrie.\u201d\n\ncborrelli@chicagotribune.com\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nFans thrilled and confused by \u2018Last Jedi\u2019 trailer\n\n\u2018Star Wars: The Last Jedi\u2019 trailer revealed at Star Wars Celebration\n\nComplete Star Wars Celebration coverage from Chicago Tribune\n\n.galleries:after {\n\ncontent: \u201d;\n\ndisplay: block;\n\nbackground-color: #144A7C;\n\nmargin: 16px auto 0;\n\nheight: 5px;\n\nwidth: 100px;\n\n}\n\n.galleries:before {\n\ncontent: \u201cEntertainment Photos and Video\u201d;\n\ndisplay: block;\n\nfont: 700 20px Georgia,serif;\n\ntext-align: center;\n\ncolor: #1e1e1e;\n\nvar playlist = \u2018chi_ent_movie_trailers\u2019,\n\nlayout = \u2018autoblurb\u2019,\n\niu = \u2018%2F4011%2Ftrb.chicagotribune%2Fent\u2019;\n\nWatch the latest movie trailers.", "images": ["https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2560px-Chicago_Tribune_Logo.svg-1.png", "data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/04/15/2M5VNZTFGZFHPHID34WVXAOYMI.jpg?w=1024&h=670"], "top_img": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/04/15/2M5VNZTFGZFHPHID34WVXAOYMI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher Borrelli"], "canonical_link": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2017/04/14/mark-hamill-pays-emotional-tribute-to-carrie-fisher-at-star-wars-gathering/", "title": "Mark Hamill pays emotional tribute to Carrie Fisher at \u2018Star Wars\u2019 gathering", "meta_data": {"application-name": "chicagotribune", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Christopher Borrelli", "canonical": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2017/04/14/mark-hamill-pays-emotional-tribute-to-carrie-fisher-at-star-wars-gathering/"}, "description": "John Williams put a finger to his lips, and the room went silent and a large movie screen held on Princess Leia, her face a cast of stony self-possession.
