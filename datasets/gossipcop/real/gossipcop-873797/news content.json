With a closed fist, like I punched her, and it busted her lip, and when I saw it I was in shock, I was \u2018f**k, why did I hit her like that?\u2019\u201d\n\nBrown recalled: \u201cSo from there she\u2019s\u2026spitting blood in my face, it raised me even more. It\u2019s a real fight in the car, and we driving in the street.\n\n\u201cShe grabbed my nuts. And when she did that, I bite her arm while I\u2019m still trying to drive.\u201d\n\nBrown was arrested and eventually pleaded guilty to assault and got five years of probation and was ordered to do six months of community service and attend domestic violence counselling.\n\nIn the documentary, the singer said his relationship with Rihanna was always violent.\n\n\u201cWe would fight each other. She would hit me, I would hit her and it never was OK,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere was always a point where we\u2019d talk about it like, \u2018What the f**k are we doing? Like, \u2018I don\u2019t like you slapping me.\u2019 If I go on stage I got a scratch on my face and I gotta explain it like, \u2018Oh, no I fell.\u2019 If you got a scar or a bruise you gotta put makeup on.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ever trying to put my hands on any female.\u201d\n\nRihanna has not yet publicly responded to Brown\u2019s version of events.", "images": ["http://www.iheartradio.ca/content/dam/audio/uploadImg/migrated/music_news/2017/8/16/chrisbrown-1-3110421.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005664&cv=4.4.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=198053572435923&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "http://www.iheartradio.ca/content/dam/audio/uploadImg/migrated/music_news/2017/8/16/chrisbrown-1-3110421.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheartradio.ca/en/music-news/chris-brown-recalls-night-he-assaulted-rihanna-1.3110410.html", "title": "Chris Brown Recalls Night He Assaulted Rihanna", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Chris Brown Recalls Night He Assaulted Rihanna", "url": "https://www.iheartradio.ca/en/music-news/chris-brown-recalls-night-he-assaulted-rihanna-1.3110410.html", "image": "http://www.iheartradio.ca/content/dam/audio/uploadImg/migrated/music_news/2017/8/16/chrisbrown-1-3110421.jpg", "locale": "en"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Chris Brown Recalls Night He Assaulted Rihanna", "image": "http://www.iheartradio.ca/content/dam/audio/uploadImg/migrated/music_news/2017/8/16/chrisbrown-1-3110421.jpg"}, "robots": "ACAP allow-index", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=5.0,width=device-width", "template": "article"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.iheartradio.ca", "summary": ""}
