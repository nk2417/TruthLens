As you might recall, the first Wonder Woman introduced Trevor as an American spy who teams up with Diana during the first World War. They fall in love, but then Trevor rides off on a heroic suicide mission, sacrificing his life in order to prevent a deadly gas from being used in the war. Considering how popular his character was, Warner Bros. brass probably decided Trevor was too handsome and pure to leave behind for the sequel\u2014implausible though his survival may be.\n\nThere are numerous ways Trevor could be brought back for the sequel, per the limitless rules of the comic-book world. Trevor could return as an alternate version of himself\u2014maybe from another dimension?\u2014or maybe he was saved from his original fate through a time jump, as comicbook.com surmises. And as The Hollywood Reporter notes, there are already inconsistencies with Trevor\u2019s timeline in the Wonder Woman comics, due to sporadic relaunches and reboots of the franchise\u2014so there are plenty of possible story lines for Jenkins to borrow for the sequel.\n\nGadot\u2019s Wonder Woman 1984 reveal, meanwhile, was a bit on the simpler side: just a still of Diana Prince standing in front of an ominous number of TV screens.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69138dc2108d96082627c8f5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined",
