Born and raised in Inglewood, California, she first gained recognition in 2011 for her cover versions of popular songs, many of which she uploaded to YouTube. One of her videos caught the attention of record producer Dr. Luke, who signed her to a recording contract with his label Kemosabe Records, an imprint of RCA Records. Shortly afterward, Gomez worked with singers will.i.am, Cody Simpson and Cher Lloyd.\n\nHer 2013 debut commercial single, \"Becky from the Block\", was released to positive reception despite failing to chart.

Afterward, she released several singles in both languages.\n\nGomez's studio albums, each recorded in Spanish, have all peaked within the top ten of the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart.

That's when I felt like, 'OK, I gotta get my life together. What am I gonna do?' I pushed that on myself at a younger age than the average kid because at the time my family had lost our home. I've always been more mature for my age, so I was already understanding what they were going through. And I just thought, 'How can I help them?'[14]\n\nShe initially attended public school, though had to undergo home schooling due to issues with bullying.[14] She claimed that at one point she was jumped by multiple girls while in the restroom, and was a frequent target due to her jobs in the entertainment industry.[15]\n\nGomez appeared in the short film El Tux (2008) as Claudia G\u00f3mez and as Nina in the Discovery Channel television film La estaci\u00f3n de la Calle Olvera (2008).[16][17] She became a member of a girl group named G.L.A.M. in 2009,[18] and later joined B.C.G., a duo with G.L.A.M. member Cristal G.[19] She filmed a music video as part of G.L.A.M. for a song titled \"JellyBean\" in 2009.

I was 100 percent in. She has so much personality and her voice just pops out of the speakers. Then I met her and discovered she could also sing and play the guitar and I thought, 'This is even better.' Then I found out she could write and it was like, 'What else are you going to tell me, that you're also Van Gogh?' Her potential is limitless.\"[15] Shortly after signing with the label, Gomez began work on her debut album.[1]\n\n2012\u20132015: Commercial success with music and acting [ edit ]\n\nGomez performing in 2013\n\nOn September 6, 2012, while working on her debut album, Gomez released her debut single \"Problem\" featuring American rapper will.i.am.
