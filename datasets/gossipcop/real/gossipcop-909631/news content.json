{"url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/lady-gaga-braid-2018-grammys", "text": "Drawing the biggest names in the music world, the Grammys red carpet is basically a carnival of drama. No one does that better than Lady Gaga, and her 2018 Grammys look didn't disappoint. Last year saw Gaga go dark with a rock and roll theme and PVC leather (complete with a fake tattoo for the occasion), but this year, the only thing that's stayed constant is the color black and her love of spectacle. To top off her ornate black Armani Priv\u00e9 gown, Lady Gaga went with a look that's all about contrast: black and pale makeup, platinum hair, and a braid that's wrapped in a literal black corset.\n\nCreated by Gaga's go-to hairstylist, Frederic Aspiras, her hair is nothing if not on theme. Aspiras pulled Gaga's long, white-blond hair into two complex French braids on either side of her head, and then laced the sides together with black ribbon until they met on her braid's tail. Corset braids (while certainly not new) have had a resurgence thanks to Instagram, and black ribbon is in the middle of a huge red carpet moment. Gaga's version blends the two trends in a way that's so cool it hurts.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/68f7bc64b668d499bbf8e27a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a6e683bdf756854b1f4b237/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-911489508.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68b87233ed3634fadb3fa113/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_image.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_640%2Cq_80%2Cw_640/v1761522411/glamour_women-of-the-year-gl-you-did-my-makeup-pat-mcgrath-tied-to-woty.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a6e688cf64d443f6c3a8564/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-911485254.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68ff927c228cfc84b2391663/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/logo-oneNav.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691b7d9f5b8b215c6e7293ac/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/69023fef168544cc53722b47/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/glamour-banner-v2.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691a4ea95bdaa9522a6c1d26/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a6e5de5df756854b1f4b22c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gaga-grammys-getty-2.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68f7a0d28fb518b4d56cfccb/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/69012339a18581c0faf5cbd3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6918ba3531cae403bd12c28b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a6e681000ffd116b25b7a27/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-911489584.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a6e6a7f9e000525aad38aa2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-911492498.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a6e5e266a59071726d867dd/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/gaga-braid-getty.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/69174c099747b5d130b803e2/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691b400f99e8794ba5a3ea3a/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a6e5de300ffd116b25b7a1d/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/gaga-grammys-getty-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a6e5de5df756854b1f4b22c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gaga-grammys-getty-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Nussbaum"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/lady-gaga-braid-2018-grammys", "title": "Lady Gaga's Braid at the 2018 Grammys Is So Cool It Hurts", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Rachel Nussbaum", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Lady Gaga has a history of show-stopping Grammys looks, and for the 2018 Grammys red carpet, Lady Gaga's long, laced-up braid didn't disappoint.", "id": "5a6e54129e000525aad38a98", "keywords": "lady gaga,grammys,braids", "news_keywords": "lady gaga,grammys,braids", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a6e54129e000525aad38a98", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Lady Gaga has a history of show-stopping Grammys looks, and for the 2018 Grammys red carpet, Lady Gaga's long, laced-up braid didn't disappoint.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a6e5d491515951ea81d7130/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/gaga-grammys-getty.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a6e5d491515951ea81d7130/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/gaga-grammys-getty.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "W-O-W.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a6e5de5df756854b1f4b22c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gaga-grammys-getty-2.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Stop and Behold Lady Gaga's Jaw-Dropping Grammys Braid From the Back", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/lady-gaga-braid-2018-grammys"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-01-29T00:11:22.224Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-29T00:11:22.224Z", "author": "Rachel Nussbaum"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "W-O-W.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a6e5de5df756854b1f4b22c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gaga-grammys-getty-2.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Stop and Behold Lady Gaga's Jaw-Dropping Grammys Braid From the Back"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a6e5de5df756854b1f4b22c/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/gaga-grammys-getty-2.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517184682.224, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
