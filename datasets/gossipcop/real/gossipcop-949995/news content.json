Abrams\u2019 \u201cStar Wars: Episode IX,\u201d which Abrams is writing and directing. Russell and Abrams last collaborated on 2006\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible III.\u201d\n\nThe role calls for action-heavy fight scenes. Russell has shown her ability to perform tough stunts in projects like FX\u2019s \u201cThe Americans,\u201d \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d and \u201cDawn of the Planet of the Apes.\u201d\n\nAbrams and Lucasfilm execs met with several actresses for the role in the past two months and settled on Russell right before the Fourth of July holiday. Abrams will likely cast two more actors by the time the film begins production at the end of the month. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Adam Driver are all expected to return.\n\nAbrams helmed \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d and was asked to come back to direct this latest installment after Colin Trevorrow exited following creative differences. Abrams filled the role last fall and has spent most of that time working on the script with Chris Terrio.\n\nIt\u2019s unknown at this time whether Russell will be on the side of the rebels or the evil empire.\n\nRussell recently wrapped the final season of \u201cThe Americans.\u201d She is repped by WME and manager Joannie Burstein.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://source.unsplash.com/random/595x333", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/keri.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/keri.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Justin Kroll", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/star-wars-episode-ix-keri-russell-1202861343/", "title": "\u2018Star Wars: Episode IX\u2019 Eyes Keri Russell (EXCLUSIVE)", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Keri Russell is headed to a galaxy far, far away, joining \"Star Wars: Episode IX.\"", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Justin Kroll", "tags": "J.
