It will be released in November and is billed as his most romantic to date.\n\nBuble, 43, admitted that he had thought he would not make another album after he and actress wife Luisana Lopilato announced in November 2016 their eldest son Noah had been diagnosed with the disease, aged three.\n\nMichael Buble returned to live performing with a sold-out show in London\u2019s Hyde Park in July (Isabel Infantes/PA)\n\nHe said: \u201cI didn\u2019t anticipate returning to recording or performing and I was fine with that.\n\n\u201cMy entire world view has changed completely these last few years. I wanted to spend all my time with my wife and kids. That was my focus.\n\n\u201cDuring that time, I also learned how much love and humanity is out in the world from the prayers and good wishes we received.\n\n\u201cBut slowly, along with understanding what my priorities in life are, I began to feel a new commitment to express the emotions and lessons I\u2019ve embraced.\u201d\n\nFour-time Grammy winner Buble returned to live performing with a sold-out show in July in London\u2019s Hyde Park, where he was joined by Noah on stage.\n\nLove will see Buble cover some of his favourite songs such as the jazz standards I Only Have Eyes For You and My Funny Valentine.\n\nSpeaking about his new record, Buble said: \u201cWhether I am the narrator, the observer, the main character, the dreamer, the broken-hearted guy at a bar or having the night of a lifetime, I have stories to tell on this record. It\u2019s all there in the songs.\n\n\u201cI have had so many blessings in life and one of them is that I hold the torch to keep these songs alive for generations to come. I take the responsibility very seriously.\n\n\u201cMy end game for the new record was to create a series of short cinematic stories for each song I chose and have it stand on its own. I\u2019m so proud of what we accomplished.\u201d\n\nMichael Buble\u2019s album Love is released on November 16.", "images":
