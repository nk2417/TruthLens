E! is reporting now that Gomez has \"completely moved on\" from the Biebs and is \"not interested in getting back together with him anytime soon,\" per multiple sources.\n\n\"She respects him as a person but has decided she is much happier doing her own thing,\" one source said. \"Selena rarely even talks about Justin anymore, and is fully open to dating.\"\n\nThese days, a second source added, Bieber and Gomez \"aren\u2019t in contact.\" E! went so far as to declare Jelena is actually done for good this time, based on the impression its sources gave. Gomez is \"going in a different direction with her life,\" the outlet's second source continued, noting she\u2019s done a lot of self-reflection.\n\n\n\nBut, the source conceded, \"You can never say never with her and Justin, but at the moment they aren't in contact and she's feeling very strong and content.\"\n\nWith the Bieber door closed (kind of), Gomez\u2019s relationship with her mother Mandy Teefey\u2014who reportedly wasn't a fan of their relationship\u2014has been \"mended. Overall everything seems to be on a high for right now.\" Sorry, Biebs.\n\nThis E! report comes one day before Gomez will drop her new track \"Back to You,\" which fans speculated may be about Bieber with its alleged \"I wanna hold you when I\u2019m not supposed to...\" lyric.\n\nLast we heard about the Jelena break was that the timing just wasn't right for them right now. \"He [Bieber] loves her so much, but they both know a serious relationship right now is just too much to take on,\" Entertainment Tonight's source said in mid-April. \u201cIt\u2019s been a weird few weeks for Selena. She\u2019s tired of taking on other people\u2019s dramas and just wants to continue focusing on herself and going to church is a big part of that. She knows the paps will be there and make a whole thing of her and Justin having a \u2018run-in,\u2019 but it\u2019s not like that, they\u2019re fine.\"\n\nJelena's permanent breakup was instigated by Gomez. E! reported at the end of March that \"Selena realized even though he's made some positive improvements, they just aren't a perfect match right now,\" per a source.", "images":
