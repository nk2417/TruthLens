Tu tienes el bate y la fuerza que yo necesito\u201d \u2014 which translates to \u201cYou treat me like a princess and give me what I ask. You have the bat and the strength I need,\u201d teasing her relationship with boyfriend and baseball legend Alex Rodriguez.\n\nAfter sharing the song\u2019s cover art on Instagram earlier Thursday, this is the first time J.Lo has released new music since her collaboration on the Skrillex and Poo Bear-produced track \u201cUs,\u201d which dropped in February, and it\u2019s her first Spanish-language single of the year.\n\nThe performance showcased Lopez\u2019s versatile style, with Bohemian-inspired vibes mixed with a touch of urban. She incorporated several dancers and finished off by asking, \u201cEl anillo pa cuando?\u201d translating to \u201cWhen is the ring coming?\u201d\n\nWatch her performance below.\n\n</iframe", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/jennifer-lopez-2018-billboard-latin-music-awards-show-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/jennifer-lopez-2018-billboard-latin-music-awards-show-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Machin", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/latin/jennifer-lopez-el-anillo-billboard-latin-music-awards-performance-8390274/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Premieres \u2018El Anillo\u2019 at the Billboard Latin Music Awards: Watch", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Jennifer Lopez took the Billboard Latin Music Awards by surprise on Thursday night (April 26) with her performance of her never-before-heard song &quot;El Anillo.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Jennifer Machin", "tags": "bbnews, billboard latin, Latin", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Premieres \u2018El Anillo\u2019 at the Billboard Latin Music Awards: Watch", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/latin/jennifer-lopez-el-anillo-billboard-latin-music-awards-performance-8390274/", "description": "Jennifer Lopez took the Billboard Latin Music Awards by surprise on Thursday night (April 26) with her performance of her never-before-heard song \"El Anillo.\"", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/jennifer-lopez-2018-billboard-latin-music-awards-show-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Jennifer Lopez"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-27T01:20:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2025-04-21T23:10:11+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jennifer Lopez took the Billboard Latin Music Awards by surprise on Thursday night (April 26) with her performance of her never-before-heard song \"El Anillo.\"", "site": "@billboard", "creator": "@jennmx3", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Premieres \u2018El Anillo\u2019 at the Billboard Latin Music Awards: Watch", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/jennifer-lopez-2018-billboard-latin-music-awards-show-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524792015.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
