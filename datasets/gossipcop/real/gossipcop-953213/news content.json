{"url": "https://people.com/tv/rhony-where-bethenny-frankel-stands-with-all-the-housewives/", "text": "It\u2019s been a tough season for Bethenny Frankel on The Real Housewives of New York City.\n\nAs the long-running Bravo series completed its tenth season, Frankel, 47, has found herself at a crossroads in her relationships with much of the cast \u2014 currently made up of Ramona Singer, Luann de Lesseps, Carole Radziwill, Dorinda Medley, Sonja Morgan and Tinsley Mortimer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit difficult,\u201d she told PEOPLE in May. \u201cThe whole season was a little bit challenging for me, truthfully. Working so much, I\u2019ve filmed [other] television shows and I\u2019m a mom, which is very important to me, obviously \u2014 and I just cracked at the end of the season. I\u2019m not used to that either, so it\u2019s a very different, unsettling season for me.\u201d\n\nSo where does Frankel stand with the Housewives going into the RHONY reunion? Here\u2019s an official rundown:\n\nCAROLE RADZIWILL: FOE\n\nThey had one of the strongest friendships across any Housewives franchise. But on season 10 of RHONY, Frankel and Radziwill\u2019s bond fell apart.\n\nWhat went wrong will depend on who you ask. Frankel claims the two were on \u201ctotally on different pages\u201d this season \u2014 she focused on her B Strong relief efforts in Puerto Rico and beyond, Radziwill more interested in fashion, selfies, her friendship with Tinsley Morimer, and not having \u201ckids\u201d or \u201ca career.\u201d\n\nRadziwill, meanwhile, insists she felt Frankel, 47, pull away first, despite making multiple financial contributions to her charity. She then got annoyed hearing that Frankel insulted her on-again, off-again boyfriend Adam Kenworthy (whom she called \u201ca bit of an operator\u201d), and started confronting Frankel about talking negatively behind her back.\n\nPaul Cheney/Bravo\n\nEvery time the two met to address their issues, their anger would intensify. Radziwill called Frankel a \u201cliar,\u201d telling her, \u201cevery time we\u2019re together you\u2019re kind of aggressive with me and kind of dismissive.\u201d Frankel disputed that, saying that she is \u201caccurate in every single detail\u201d and Radziwill was \u201ccondescending.\u201d By the time their trip to Colombia came around, the two were barely speaking to one another.\n\nThe season ended with Frankel and Radziwill on cordial terms. But as it aired, Frankel and Radziwill\u2019s friendship fell apart even more \u2014 Radziwill even blasting Frankel in a scathing blog post, calling her \u201cself-righteous\u201d and claiming that her \u201cego\u201d has gotten the best of her.\n\nHeidi Gutman/Bravo\n\nIn July, Radziwill announced she was departing the show on her own terms, saying in a statement to PEOPLE that she was \u201cthrilled to leave frenemies behind\u201d and to move on to other projects. Frankel followed up days latter on Twitter implying that it wasn\u2019t Radziwill\u2019s choice, writing, \u201cBravo has reasons for not asking hwives to return. It\u2019s based on research & focus groups & YOU. Aside from 3 years I left, no RHONY cast member has ever quit. One saying they chose to depart & attributing it to me is fiction. It\u2019s healthier to be truthful about a hard situation.\u201d\n\nThough they are no longer the best of friends, Radziwill did send love to Frankel following the death of on-off boyfriend Dennis Shields earlier this month. \u201cI just heard the sad news about Dennis. He was a good man,\u201d Radziwill, 54, wrote on Twitter. \u201cMy condolences to all his family and friends. So tragic.\u201d\n\nLUANN DE LESSEPS: FRIEND\n\nPaul Cheney/Bravo\n\nFrankel has been known to patch things up with longtime enemies in the past. Why? Just ask de Lesseps.\n\nThe two were longtime rivals, Frankel even calling de Lesseps \u201ca slut and a liar and a hypocrite and a snake\u201d during a Berkshires blowout in season 8. But this year, the O.G. N.Y.C. Housewives bonded, and remained really close friends throughout.\n\nSadly, de Lesseps won\u2019t be there to support Frankel at the reunion. Days before its taping, Frankel helped de Lesseps return to an alcohol treatment center.\n\n\u201cLuann is now surrounded by a core group of people who truly have her best interests at heart and who are working to make sure she gets the help she needs,\u201d Frankel told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s a brave and honest decision by her, and everyone is rallying around her and wants the best for her.\u201d\n\nRAMONA SINGER: FOE\n\nHeidi Gutman/Bravo\n\nThis should come as no surprise to RHONY fans. Though they both started the show together, Frankel and Singer haven\u2019t connected as friends in years.\n\nThings first started crumbling back in season 3, when during a chat on the Brooklyn Bridge, Singer said Frankel\u2019s relationship with now ex-Jason Hoppy would likely fall apart. From there, it only got worse. When she returned to the show in season 7, Frankel accused Singer of stealing dresses. Then last season, Frankel refused to accept Singer\u2019s multiple apologies for bringing up Frankel\u2019s naked film past in the context of her young daughter Bryn.\n\n\u201cBethenny\u2019s just not a nice person,\u201d Singer, 61, said this season on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, later blasting Frankel for not supporting other women. \u201cShe always has something negative to say about everybody. \u2026 And she pushes everyone away. She\u2019s a bully.\u201d\n\nSONJA MORGAN: FRIEND\n\nPaul Cheney/Bravo\n\nHere\u2019s another example of a former foe turning into a friend.\n\nBack in season 8, when Morgan tried to launch her own booze business called Tipsy Girl, Frankel went off on her \u2014 the Skinnygirl founder saying that she wanted nothing to do with Morgan and her \u201cnonexistent businesses.\u201d\n\nWhat a difference a year makes. With some distance between them, and Tipsy Girl never materializing, Frankel and Morgan bonded. And when Morgan, 54, feuded with Medley, Frankel was there to stand up for her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to hold up Bethenny,\u201d Morgan said on WWHL when asked about their friendship. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything but that right now.\u201d\n\nDORINDA MEDLEY: FOE\n\nPeter Kramer/Bravo\n\nOn the surface, Frankel and Medley have a lot in common, which is why it was surprising to see this pair on opposite sides of ongoing awkwardness all season long.\n\nPinning down what happened between the two is much harder to do than, say, Frankel and Radziwill\u2019s feud. Medley could sense Frankel\u2019s guard was up all season long, and every time they discussed it, it appeared to come down to Frankel not trusting Medley. But they would make up each time, and try to move forward.\n\nEventually, the two went on a trip to Puerto Rico for one of the Skinnygirl mogul\u2019s B Strong relief missions, where Frankel addressed Medley\u2019s alcohol intake. \u201cYou go to a 16 out of 10 and I need to really say it to you \u2014 the way that you sometimes treat me is worse than [Singer],\u201d Frankel said. \u201cI just cut you slack because you\u2019re a drunk.\u201d\n\nMedley has long denied that. \u201cI don\u2019t have a drinking problem,\u201d she said on WWHL. \u201cWe got to stop that topic.\u201d\n\nTINSLEY MORTIMER: CO-WORKER\n\nEugene Gologursky/Bravo\n\nRELATED VIDEO: RHONY\u2018s Tinsley Mortimer Says She\u2019s #TeamCarole Amidst Housewife Drama with Bethenny Frankel\n\nOf all of the New York City cast, Mortimer seems the most indifferent towards Frankel.\n\nThe two have never been friends or foes, rarely sharing a scene together away from the rest of the group.\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure: Mortimer\u2019s closeness with Radziwill hasn\u2019t influenced her relationship with Frankel.\n\n\u201cMy relationship from Carole is separate from that,\u201d Mortimer told PEOPLE. \u201cOf course I am Team Carole, but their relationship, it\u2019s sad. I really hope that they work this out. I\u2019ve only known them being close. When I met them, they were best friends. So I don\u2019t like to see that deteriorate or fall apart.\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of New York City airs Wednesdays (8 p.m. ET) on Bravo.", "images":
