E! took over a Los Angeles parking lot at night and projected a series of questions onto the side of a building, such as \u201cWhat would you call someone who speaks up when no one else will?\u201d Passersby stepped up to a microphone to respond, unaware that they were being prompted to form conclusions about the former \u201cCharmed\u201d star.\n\nMcGowan says Harvey Weinstein raped her at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997. On October 12, one week after the New York Times reported that she had accepted a $100,000 settlement from the fired studio chairman, McGowan tweeted the accusation she had long hinted at.\n\nThe voiced opinions in the promo are at odds with one another: Is the actress-turned-activist \u201cinspiring\u201d and a \u201cchampion,\u201d or \u201cdamaged\u201d and \u201cmisunderstood\u201d? E! ends the spot with the tagline, \u201cIt\u2019s easy to label someone, but we are all more than a label,\u201d which follows voiceover from McGowan\u2019s compelling speech at the Women\u2019s Convention in Detroit this October.\n\n\u201cCitizen Rose\u201d is a five-part endeavor. The series launched with a two-hour premiere on January 30, the date she published her New York Times bestselling memoir, \u201cBrave.\u201d In that episode, viewers learned that an MTV film crew had accompanied her at Sundance the day of her alleged assault, and McGowan was told that Weinstein\u2019s legal team had obtained a large portion of her manuscript.\n\n\u201cWhen I found out that the monster stole the first 125 pages of my book to discredit and destroy my voice, I can\u2019t tell you how violating it felt,\u201d she said in the premiere.\n\nThe second installment of \u201cCitizen Rose\u201d airs Thursday, May 17 at 10 p.m. Watch the teaser below.\n\nSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!
