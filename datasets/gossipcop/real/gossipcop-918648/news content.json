For the first time in its 37-year history, the fashion industry\u2019s big night will take place at the Brooklyn Museum \u2014 where the David Bowie Is exhibition, featuring many of the iconic performer\u2019s costumes, opened last Friday.\n\nTaking the reins from last year\u2019s host Seth Meyers, the 33-year-old Insecure actress/director/producer/web series creator (and also a fashion force, known for her bedazzling looks on the red carpet) will be the first female host in years \u2014 we count nine since comedian Tracey Ullman led the ceremony in 2009. Meyers (who also hosted the awards show in 2012) was preceded by Joel McHale, James Corden, John Waters, Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper. (There was no host in 2010.)\n\n\u201cIssa Rae is leading a new generation of performers who use their voice and humor to discuss social topics in a way that is relatable and poignant,\u201d said CFDA president and CEO Steven Kolb. \u201cWe are also excited to take the awards to Brooklyn this year. The Brooklyn Museum is a strong and iconic backdrop to one of fashion\u2019s biggest nights.\u201d\n\nThe 2018 CFDA Awards nominees and honorees will be unveiled on the @cfda Instagram page on Thursday, March 15, at 7:30 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gettyimages-924827816_copy_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gettyimages-924827816_copy_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ingrid Schmidt", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/issa-rae-host-2018-cfda-awards-1092015/", "title": "Issa Rae to Host 2018 CFDA Awards", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The 'Insecure' actress-director-producer will be the first female host of fashion's biggest awards show in nine years.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Ingrid Schmidt", "tags": "Issa Rae, Style News", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Issa Rae to Host 2018 CFDA Awards", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/issa-rae-host-2018-cfda-awards-1092015/", "description": "The 'Insecure' actress-director-producer will be the first female host of fashion's biggest awards show in nine years.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gettyimages-924827816_copy_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Issa Rae Host 2018 CFDA Awards"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-05T13:49:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-05T15:09:50+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 'Insecure' actress-director-producer will be the first female host of fashion's biggest awards show in nine years.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Issa Rae to Host 2018 CFDA Awards", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gettyimages-924827816_copy_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520257779.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
