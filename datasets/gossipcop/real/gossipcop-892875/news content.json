In shepherding this new trilogy, which is separate from the episodic Skywalker saga, Johnson will introduce new characters from a corner of the galaxy that Star Wars lore has never before explored.\n\n\u201cWe all loved working with Rian on The Last Jedi,\u201d said Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm. \"He's a creative force, and watching him craft The Last Jedi from start to finish was one of the great joys of my career. Rian will do amazing things with the blank canvas of this new trilogy.\"\n\n\"We had the time of our lives collaborating with Lucasfilm and Disney on The Last Jedi,\" Johnson and Bergman said in a joint statement. \"Star Wars is the greatest modern mythology and we feel very lucky to have contributed to it. We can't wait to continue with this new series of films.\"\n\nJohnson\u2019s upcoming Star Wars: The Last Jedi arrives in U.S. theaters on Dec. 15, 2017.\n\nNo release dates have been set for the new films, and no porgs were available for comment.\n\nStarWars.com.
