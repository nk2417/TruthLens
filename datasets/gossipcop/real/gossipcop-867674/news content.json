The kids, who were from the Make-A-Wish program, met with Reynolds, took photos with him, and even left with their own bamboo swords crafted by the film\u2019s prop master Dan Sissons. It was a heart-warming moment that Reynolds later shared on Instagram; however, not everyone was pleased with what they saw.\n\nOne apparently soulless Instagram user criticized the actor for allowing young children to visit the set of Deadpool, which centers on an anti-superhero who has a habit of dropping f-bombs. The commenter wrote: \u201cGuys [D]eadpool is [an] R rated movie and those kids are watching it\u2026I think something is wrong here [angry face emoji].\u201d\n\nReynolds hit back.\n\n\u201cYup. Deadpool is Rated R. If my kid went through a fraction of the shit these kids deal with daily, I think they can watch whatever they like. That\u2019s just my .02 cents,\u201d he responded.\n\nDeadpool: 1. Internet troll: 0.\n\nYou can check out the photos from the Make-A-Wish visit below. Deadpool 2 is set to hit U.S. theaters May 18.", "images": ["https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,c_fill,ar_1.50,w_2048,g_auto/v1723865781/sanity-new/ryan-reynolds-134819780.jpg", "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723865782/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-913-1670471141-12_16x9-6482614"], "top_img": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723865782/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-913-1670471141-12_16x9-6482614", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joshua Espinoza"], "canonical_link": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/cmplxjoshua-espinoza/ryan-reynolds-troll-upset-about-make-a-wish-kids-visiting-deadpool-2-set", "title": "Ryan Reynolds Corrects Troll Upset About Make-A-Wish Kids...", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Reynolds said, \"If my kid went through a fraction of the sh*t these kids deal with daily, I think they can watch whatever they like.\"", "og": {"title": "Ryan Reynolds Corrects Troll Upset About Make-A-Wish Kids...", "description": "Reynolds said, \"If my kid went through a fraction of the ...", "url": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/a/cmplxjoshua-espinoza/ryan-reynolds-troll-upset-about-make-a-wish-kids-visiting-deadpool-2-set", "site_name": "Complex", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723865782/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-913-1670471141-12_16x9-6482614", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "@complex", "id": 13049362}, "title": "Ryan Reynolds Corrects Troll Upset About Make-A-Wish...", "description": "Reynolds said, \"If my kid went through a fraction of the sh*t these kids deal with daily, I think they can watch whatever ...", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/ar_1.91,c_fill,g_auto,q_auto/v1723865782/sanity-new%2Ftmp-name-3-913-1670471141-12_16x9-6482614"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.complex.com", "summary": ""}
