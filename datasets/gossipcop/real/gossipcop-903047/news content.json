In the pic, Saint is holding up a wrapped pink box.\n\n\"Happy New Year! We\u2019re kicking the year off with news of the best gift yet: ?? coming to our family in 2018... love Pete, Meagan, Bronx and Saint,\" Wentz wrote.\n\nLast month, the proud dad shared a sweet video of his two boys goofing around with silly string, and we can only imagine how much fun they'll have when their little sister arrives!\n\nWentz and Camper, 28, began dating in 2011 and welcomed Saint in 2014. The 38-year-old bassist shares Bronx with his ex-wife, Ashlee Simpson-Ross, who also has a 2-year-old daughter, Jagger Snow, with her current husband, Evan Ross.\n\nCongratulations to the parents-to-be!\n\n\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-05/1280_fall_out_boy_smoke_bomb.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/pete_wentz_gf_getty634824700_0.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2015-01/640_ashlee_simpson_pete_wen.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-11/gettyimages-1063551938.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2014-08/640_pete_wentz_meagan.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/pete_wentz_gf_getty634824700_0.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/pete_wentz_gf_getty634824700_0.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/fall-out-boys-pete-wentz-expecting-baby-girl-girlfriend-meagan-camper-93358", "title": "Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz Expecting Baby Girl With Girlfriend Meagan Camper", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/pete_wentz_gf_getty634824700_0.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "This will be the third child for the Fall Out Boy bassist.", "title": "Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz Expecting Baby Girl With Girlfriend Meagan Camper", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/fall-out-boys-pete-wentz-expecting-baby-girl-girlfriend-meagan-camper-93358", "type": "Article"}, "description": "This will be the third child for the Fall Out Boy bassist.", "twitter": {"description": "This will be the third child for the Fall Out Boy bassist.", "title": "Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz Expecting Baby Girl With Girlfriend Meagan Camper", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/fall-out-boys-pete-wentz-expecting-baby-girl-girlfriend-meagan-camper-93358", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/pete_wentz_gf_getty634824700_0.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Fall Out Boy's Pete Wentz Expecting Baby Girl With Girlfriend Meagan Camper | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Pete Wentz, Pregnancies, Babies & Kids", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
