While in school she performed in multiple stage productions, UCLA's Awaken A Cappella, and received the Gant Gaither Theater Award from the Princess Grace Foundation-USA. Robinson also received a scholarship from the Jackie Robinson Foundation.[2]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nIn 2012, Robinson married actor Leslie Odom Jr., whom she met in 2008 while auditioning for a role in the musical Once on This Island in Los Angeles.[7] Odom, who would later become known for originating the role of Aaron Burr in the stage musical Hamilton, served as the assistant director of Once on This Island.[7] As Robinson would be replacing an actress who had left the production, Odom was tasked with ensuring that she easily transitioned into the role. The two began a relationship after the show's run ended.[6]\n\nOn April 23, 2017, the two had their first child, a daughter named Lucille Ruby.[8] On March 25, 2021, their son, Able Phineas, was born.[9]\n\nPerformances [ edit ]\n\nStage [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/Nicolette_robinson_2021_1.jpg/250px-Nicolette_robinson_2021_1.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Nicolette_robinson_2021_1.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Nicolette_robinson_2021_1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolette_Robinson", "title": "Nicolette Robinson", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/Nicolette_robinson_2021_1.jpg", "width": 814, "height": 1200}, "title": "Nicolette Robinson - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
