I got a cold, I was at the doctor earlier and got antibiotics.\"\n\nFROM PEN: 'It Was a Fairytale!' All the Exclusive Details on Tara Lipinski's Ultra-Chic Southern Wedding\n\nMarriage, it turns out, had changed things for Parsons \u2014 who in November will celebrate 15 years with Spiewak.\n\n\"I don't know in a specific day-to-day sense what it is \u2014 I don't know that there is anything. There is an underlying buzz of a thing,\" he told Colbert. \"And I keep reminding myself of it. Like, I kind of forget and then I'm like, 'We really did it! We're a legal thing, just like Mom and Dad were or whatever.'\"\n\nHe went on to describe the sensation he feels being married, one that he equates to a sense of \"divinity.\"\n\n\"To be in love, to find a love in that way, is as close to anything I can imagine doing in life that brings me close to the feeling of God \u2014 or whatever that is for you,\" he said.\n\n\"When we first got together, I remember lying in bed and closing my eyes but not being asleep. And that sensation of 'light.' I was like, 'I don't know what's going on exactly, but it's sort of close to eternal,' \" Parsons continued. \"My dad had passed a couple of years before I met Todd. And I remember very early on that sensation I would have when I closed my eyes and I felt that light, it was like, 'Oh that's him.' He's going like, 'Hi, I see. All good. This is a great thing.' And it both was and it wasn't, obviously \u2026 but I still feel that now. Maybe not as often, because life gets in the way. But sometimes that sensation in closing the eyes and going, 'This is so close to God.'\"\n\nWhile Parsons admitted to Colbert he \"didn't know any other word for it,\" Colbert had an answer.\n\n\"Love,\" the 53-year-old talk show host responded.\n\nThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert airs weeknights (11:35 p.m. ET) and The Big Bang Theory returns Monday at 8 p.m. ET, both on CBS.",
