Young first worked with Jackson at the InStyle and Warner Bros. Golden Globes after party in January \u2014 and has been crafting the teen\u2019s attention-getting looks ever since.\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that Jackson, the only daughter of late pop legend Michael Jackson, signed a six-figure deal with Calvin Klein. The brand has not yet confirmed a collaboration, the speculation sparked after Paris Jackson made her Met Gala debut wearing one of its designs. Young isn\u2019t privy to the details surrounding Jackson\u2019s rumored deal, but she does offer a tidbit: \u201cCalvin Klein is someone who she will be wearing.\u201d\n\nWWD caught up with Young about Jackson\u2019s red-carpet style, fashion outlook and more:\n\nYou May Also Like\n\nWWD: How did the InStyle collaboration with Paris come about?\n\nSonia Young: We got introduced through her publicist, Mark, who\u2019s a good friend of mine. We met and we did her first outfit and it got tons of attention. It was her first big red carpet. When you meet someone for the first time, you have to gingerly walk around what they like, what they don\u2019t, so it was a learning curve \u2014 as everything is. Her biggest thing is that she wanted to be comfortable and she wanted to wear something that she loved, so that\u2019s how we picked the Tadashi dress. She liked the silhouette of it, she liked that it was sheer. It was a perfect first look for her and it really set the tone for what\u2019s next.\n\nWWD: What\u2019s your work relationship like?\n\n\n\nS.Y.: We bounce off of each other. I\u2019ll come to her with something and she\u2019ll be, like, \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d And then she\u2019ll be, like, \u201cWhat if we did this?\u201d There\u2019s a lot of \u201cabsolutely nots\u201d on either side, but then we meet somewhere in the middle and we end up coming up with something that\u2019s fantastic.\n\nWWD: This is the first year we\u2019ve seen her come into her own. What\u2019s your approach to crafting her entry into the limelight?\n\n\n\nS.Y.: The biggest thing with Paris is that she wants to use her platform for good. She wants to bring awareness to situations, so if we can do, say, the Alison Lou Planned Parenthood earring that she wears all the time or even something as simple as a peace sign on the back of her dress that she designed with Jeremy Scott. She always likes to be heard and we like to reflect that in her clothing.\n\nParis Jackson in Tadashi Shoji at the InStyle Golden Globes party.

She likes to wear stuff that reflects her personality, and she\u2019s not gonna wear something that she doesn\u2019t love.\n\nWWD: What about her casual style?\n\n\n\nS.Y.: She\u2019s the most relatable girl of her generation. Who doesn\u2019t go to Starbucks in their sweatpants and Uggs, you know? She\u2019s so real. When she\u2019s on the carpet, that\u2019s work and she turns it on and she wears the glamorous stuff. But when she\u2019s at home and she\u2019s not working, she loves wearing her band Ts, her tie-dye, her Doc Martens. Uggs are a big staple in the wardrobe of Miss Paris.\n\nParis Jackson in Yanina Couture at the 2017 GLAAD Awards. Jim Smeal/BEI/Shutterstock\n\nWWD: Which designers does she gravitate toward?\n\n\n\nS.Y.: We don\u2019t necessarily look at labels in our fittings. We go off of what she likes. It\u2019s an eclectic mix. We\u2019ll have up-and-coming designers, we\u2019ll have really established fashion houses. We decide what feels right. For GLAAD, I never in a million years thought she would want to wear a ballgown with a rainbow on it, but it was appropriate for the occasion and she loved it. We\u2019re not driven by the designer. We\u2019re driven by what she wants.\n\nWWD: How do you see her style evolving?\n\n\n\nS.Y.: We have a cool relationship where we can find what is gonna be her style. She\u2019s 19. I think it\u2019s always gonna be evolving and I think fashion always is evolving. I don\u2019t think we have a label where we want to go or what we want to achieve. I think we want to just stay true to who we are and keep creating beautiful looks and empowering young women and wearing great stuff.\n\nParis Jackson in Calvin Klein by Appointment Rob Latour/REX/Shutterstock\n\nMore from WWD.com:\n\nKeri Russell Loves Shopping While Lying in Bed\n\nMeet \u2018Twin Peaks\u2019 Arrival and David Lynch Recruit Amy Shiels\n\nCleo Wade, Herieth Paul on What It Takes To Be a Muse\n\nWhatever Happened to the Boys of No Doubt?", "images": ["https://wwd.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-wwd-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31f3D02tYU8zY.gif", "https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rexfeatures_8770831vt.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=609602&fmt=gif", "https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=2612680468235&pd[em]=&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rexfeatures_8770831vt.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexa Tietjen", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://wwd.com/eye/people/paris-jackson-stylist-sonia-young-10891301/", "title": "Paris Jackson\u2019s Stylist Opens Up About Crafting Her Entry Into the Limelight", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://wwd.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-wwd-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/a9597fffaf6885dd6f870d1269ef3b72.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Stylist Sonia Young talks Paris Jackson's style, fashion outlook and more.", "fb": {"pages": 19457049254}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Alexa Tietjen", "tags": "Celebrity Style, personal style", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Paris Jackson\u2019s Stylist Opens Up About Crafting Her Entry Into the Limelight", "url": "https://wwd.com/eye/people/paris-jackson-stylist-sonia-young-10891301/", "description": "Stylist Sonia Young talks Paris Jackson's style, fashion outlook and more.", "site_name": "WWD", "image": {"identifier": "https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rexfeatures_8770831vt.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 1536, "alt": "Paris JacksonThe Costume Institute Benefit celebrating the opening of Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garcons: Art of the In-Between, Arrivals, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, USA - 01 May 2017"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-20T12:00:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-05-20T12:00:38+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@wwd", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Paris Jackson\u2019s Stylist Opens Up About Crafting Her Entry Into the Limelight", "description": "Stylist Sonia Young talks Paris Jackson's style, fashion outlook and more.", "image": "https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rexfeatures_8770831vt.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495281637.0, "source": "https://wwd.com", "summary": ""}
