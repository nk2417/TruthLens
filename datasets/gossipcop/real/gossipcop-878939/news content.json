Mindy Kaling is pregnant with a baby girl, Us Weekly can exclusively reveal. Her costars spilled the beans while attending the PaleyFest Fall TV Preview event for The Mindy Project in L.A. on Friday, September 8.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just thrilled out of my mind! I cried like a baby and that it\u2019s a girl \u2026 I just think that she\u2019s up to it,\u201d Beth Grant, who plays Beverly Janoszewski on the hit show, told Us. \u201cI just think that she\u2019s ready and I\u2019m very happy for her because I have a daughter that\u2019s turning 25 and it\u2019s just the greatest thing in the world!\u201d\n\nEd Weeks, who plays Dr. Jeremy Reed, also shared the same sentiment to Us, saying, \u201cWe were so thrilled for her\u2026 The show started as a tribute to her mother, who very sadly passed away just as the show is being picked up, and it ends with her having a daughter of her own.\u201d\n\nRelated: Just Like Us: Celebrity Moms From grocery shopping to bonding with their kids, see how star mamas spend their day\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot a lot. When she reminded us all of that, we all cried in the final table read,\u201d the English actor continued. \u201cI mean Jesus, life! It makes some very interesting and beautiful patterns sometimes.\u201d\n\nGrant thinks that Kaling will be a wonderful role model for her future daughter. \u201cShe does know my daughter and she\u2019s been very kind to her. In fact, when my daughter graduated Julliard, she took her to lunch and sent her flowers and gave her a gift and gave her a little costar role on the show this season. I think she\u2019s mentored a lot of young women and a lot of her former assistants are writing now,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s really good about giving young women opportunities and mentoring young women, so I think it\u2019s a natural thing for her to be a mom.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Moms Who Disappeared From Hollywood After Having Kids After having children, not all celebrity moms return to the spotlight \u2014 click through the gallery to see who took an extended break from Hollywood\n\nAs for potential baby names, Weeks hilariously pitched his character\u2019s name to Kaling as an option \u2014 to no avail. \u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018That\u2019s not a first name. That\u2019s two names,\u2019\u201d he joked.\n\nWeeks also revealed Kaling broke the news of her pregnancy while on set of their Hulu series. \u201cShe kind of just took us aside on set, weirdly in the open office area where we film most of our scenes. She said, \u2018Guys, I just want you to know I\u2019m pregnant. I haven\u2019t told anybody.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll do that amazing as she does everything else,\u201d the actor added to Us. \u201cShe\u2019s already created a show, how hard can it be to create some lungs and liver and stuff, kidneys?\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Babies of 2017 Babies on board!
