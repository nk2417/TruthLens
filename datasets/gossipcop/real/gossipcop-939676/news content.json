In a tweet sent early Monday, the former \u201cCharmed\u201d star said she her \u201cheart is broken\u201d by the New York Times\u2019 expose published Sunday that Argento reached a $380,000 settlement with actor-musician Jimmy Bennett, who claims Argento sexually assaulted him in a hotel room when he was 17.\n\n\u201cI got to know Asia Argento ten months ago. Our commonality is the shared pain of being assaulted by Harvey Weinstein. My heart is broken. I will continue my work on behalf of victims everywhere,\u201d McGowan wrote. A few hours later, she expressed qualified support for Argento in another tweet: \u201cNone of us know the truth of the situation and I\u2019m sure more will be revealed. Be gentle.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nhttps://twitter.com/rosemcgowan/status/1031477689947967489\n\nhttps://twitter.com/rosemcgowan/status/1031535197433602048\n\nMcGowan has gained stature as a victims\u2019 advocate in the year since the Weinstein allegations first broke in the New York Times and New Yorker last October. Her chaotic lifestyle was chronicled earlier this year in the four-part E! series \u201cCitizen Rose.\u201d Argento made appearances in two of the episodes.\n\nArgento is the daughter of famed Italian director Dario Argento.\n\n(Pictured: Asia Argento, Rose McGowan)", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rose-mcgowan-asia-argento.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rose-mcgowan-asia-argento.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Variety Staff", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/rose-mcgowan-asia-argento-sexual-assault-accusation-1202909955/", "title": "Rose McGowan on Asia Argento Accusation: \u2018My Heart Is Broken\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Rose McGowan has moved to distance herself from Asia Argento following the revelation that Argento has been accused of sexual assault.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Variety Staff", "tags": "Asia Argento, Rose Mcgowan", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Rose McGowan on Asia Argento Accusation: \u2018My Heart Is Broken\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/rose-mcgowan-asia-argento-sexual-assault-accusation-1202909955/", "description": "Rose McGowan has moved to distance herself from Asia Argento following the revelation that Argento has been accused of sexual assault.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rose-mcgowan-asia-argento.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Rose McGowan Asia Argento"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-08-20T12:43:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-20T16:10:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Rose McGowan has moved to distance herself from Asia Argento following the revelation that Argento has been accused of sexual assault.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@Variety", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Rose McGowan on Asia Argento Accusation: \u2018My Heart Is Broken\u2019", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rose-mcgowan-asia-argento.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1534768993.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
