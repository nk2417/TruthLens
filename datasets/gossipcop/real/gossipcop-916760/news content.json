They had two children together. Brandon also had two children from a previous relationship. As we detail later in this article, during his divorce process with Kelly, at one point, Brandon requested to be paid $436,000 per month in spousal and child support. When it was all said and done, Kelly agreed to pay him $45,000 per month in child support until their children turn 18 and $115,000 per month in spousal support for two years, ending in January 2024. Finally, she paid him $1.2 million to cover his legal expenses.\n\nTragically, Brandon died in August 2025 from cancer at the age of 48.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBrandon Blackstock was born in Fort Worth, Texas, in December 1976. Brandon is the stepson of singer Reba McEntire, and his father, Narvel Blackstock, is Clarkson's manager. Narvel was married to Reba for 26 years, from 1989 to 2015. Narvel and Reba had one child together. Soon after marrying, Narvel and Reba formed a corporation called Starstruck Entertainment that managed all aspects of Reba's career. When they divorced, Narvel reportedly received a large percentage of Reba's wealth, which was considered communal property.\n\nBrandon Blackstock and Kelly Clarkson were engaged in 2012 and married in 2013. When they met, Blackstock was technically still married to Melissa Ashworth. Brandon and Melissa's divorce was finalized in 2012. Brandon and Melissa had two children together. Together, Kelly and Brandon have a daughter and a son together.\n\nReal Estate\n\nDuring their marriage, Brandon and Kelly resided in an $8 million mansion in Encino, California. In June 2018, Kelly bought the 10,000-square-foot mansion in Encino, California, that became the family's primary residence. They had previously been renting an LA home that had been burglarized a number of times. Kelly listed the Encino home for sale in May 2020 for a tad under $10 million. The price was reduced to $9 million and then finally $8.24 million when it finally sold in September 2021. Here's a video tour of that house:\n\nThey also owned a home in Nashville, Tennessee, and a ranch in Montana. Kelly maintained ownership of the ranch after the divorce. Brandon was ultimately awarded a 5% stake. At the time of that 5% award, the ranch was valued at $17 million.\n\nDivorce Settlement\n\nKelly filed for divorce in June 2020. In December 2020, Brandon filed paperwork in which he requested $436,000 PER MONTH in spousal support. He broke the request down as $135,000 in child support and $301,000 in spousal support. He also requested a one-time $2 million payment to cover legal expenses. Brandon also asserted that he wanted their two children to live with him in Montana.\n\nA judge eventually ordered Kelly to pay Brandon $45,000 per month in child support, presumably until their kids are 18. She was also ordered to pay $115,000 per month in spousal support for two years ending in January 2024. Finally, he was awarded $1.2 million for legal fees as a one-time payment.\n\nManagement Fee Lawsuit\n\nAs they were battling it out over spousal support, Kelly filed legal documents with the California Labor Commission. She claimed Brandon defrauded her during the 13 years he served as her manager. She also asserted that Brandon was not licensed to operate as a talent agent because talent agents in California must be licensed. A spokesperson for Brandon's company, Starstruck Management Group, countered by pointing out that during that period, Kelly was always properly represented by her separate talent agency CAA. Two months earlier, Starstruck sued Kelly for $1.4 million in owed commissions.\n\nIn November 2023, an LA judge sided with Kelly. The judge agreed that Brandon had overcharged Kelly by millions of dollars when representing her as her manager. Specifically, the ruling showed that Brandon overcharged on deals he inked for Kelly to appear on \"The Voice,\" and in commercials for Wayfair and Norwegian Cruise Line.", "images": ["https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/1JoH3482haSLevnlEMdqhrz36y0=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/11/George-Clooney.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/I4dSiTJhq0kprSuO--deoPCEAmQ=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/06/taylor.png", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/GGGhd7BH54GbJYhm8tm4Oz24VaU=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/11/Kelly-Clarkson.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/KNDSqD-9inbRekV6AGgXDEG2Scw=/375x35:810x586/132x132/filters:format(webp):strip_exif()/2015/09/GettyImages-476575299.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/themes/cnw_2023/svg/logo.svg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/pDeySRG9z--jNt9KhxFF-fOzTGs=/600x300/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2015/03/bb.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/0dOqT2nlNQM7u_J-5xWrCsf2nAw=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/02/Angelina-Jolie.png", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/_hOmdPz8Ht24ZxIeZM7m4mGRouk=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/11/GettyImages-1094653148.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/Y14fttV9jls9mxFLuNAHJTnNWTE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/10/denzel-washington-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/yboGsO77E1kQwELLmrwRZv_4RmE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2017/02/GettyImages-528215436.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/lt1abKKVHSBtY-US0k9GLU9MTmM=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/09/Brad-Pitt.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/PQwGq5rg0_nC7MfeNeD68sbzt88=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2010/02/Reba-McEntire.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/qjT5vGez8iN655Bb2ATFQsNnneY=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/04/britney-2.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/IoWqGPmFDjvC6iTqcDsspXBuxqo=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2018/03/GettyImages-821622848.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/dXuAPIEBU--L_kRib4u0nSzjUtE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/04/Megan-Fox.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/lY3-oCS-xIdiqDaOi1qHd6UaTjg=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/09/Cristiano-Ronaldo.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bb.jpg?x46379", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/95i5RI1LWkjHyyoolMeto-z_WeU=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/01/lopez3.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/Jahznk8vl5SCg7WIM7JtwfJnAEs=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2018/12/narvel-blackstock.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript"], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bb.jpg?x46379", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/producers/brandon-blackstock-net-worth/", "title": "Brandon Blackstock Net Worth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Brandon Blackstock was an American talent manager who had a net worth of $10 million at the time of his death in August 2025.", "slick": {"wpversion": "3.0.1", "wppostid": 141482, "featured_image": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bb.jpg?x46379", "group": "post", "category": "producers:Producers"}, ";": "richest-businessmen:Richest Business", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Celebrity Net Worth", "application-name": "Celebrity Net Worth", "msapplication-TileColor": "#603cba", "msapplication-config": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/wp-content/themes/cnw_2023/images/favicons_202304/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#152934", "cnw": {"wppostid": 141482}, "fb": {"app_id": 241750049176605, "admins": 194602255, "pages": 135556409817901}, "og": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "Brandon Blackstock Net Worth", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/producers/brandon-blackstock-net-worth/", "image": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bb.jpg?x46379", "site_name": "Celebrity Net Worth", "description": "What is Brandon Blackstock's net worth?"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CelebrityNetWorth", "modified_time": "2025-08-07T18:39:53+00:00", "published_time": "2015-03-18T22:29:37+00:00", "section": "Producers", "tag": "brandon blackstock worth"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@celebnetworth", "image": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/bb.jpg?x46379", "title": "Brandon Blackstock Net Worth", "description": "Brandon Blackstock was an American talent manager who had a net worth of $10 million at the time of his death in August 2025."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1426717777.0, "source": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com", "summary": ""}
