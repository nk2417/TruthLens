Bayona told us \u201chints at a short section of the movie,\u201d is a precursor to a final act which merges gothic horror with scares evoking Steven Spielberg's original which turns 25 later this month.\n\nIt seems that while some critics have lapped up the film's thrills, others remain unconvinced by the latest big-budget attempt from Universal Pictures despite hailing it as a better film than Jurassic World. You can read a selection below for yourself.\n\nThe Independent - Geoffrey Macnab - 4 stars\n\n\"This is a summer popcorn movie with all the trimmings - action, cheesy in-jokes, startling visual effects and a storyline with a moralising, eco-friendly subtext.\"\n\nThe Guardian - Peter Bradshaw - 2 stars\n\n\"There are some reasonably entertaining scenes and set pieces, but the whole concept feels tired and contrived, and crucially the dinosaurs themselves are starting to look samey, without inspiring much of the awe or terror they used to.\"\n\nThe Telegraph - Robbie Collin - 2 stars\n\n\"Hollywood finds a way to make dinosaurs boring.\"\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter - John Defore\n\n\"While the movie courses seamlessly through different modes, it remains old-fashioned in its treatment of Howard's character, who mostly screams and runs while Owen gets things done. Claire has grown up a lot since her debut as Jurassic World's soulless corporate climber, but she remains a damsel in distress who (this time, as last) gets to perform a single far-fetched heroic feat when things are at their most dire.\"\n\nEmpire - Ben Travis - 4 stars\n\n\"The island is where Bayona\u2019s disaster movie credentials come into play. He invokes the relentless intensity of The Impossible's harrowing tsunami in a thunderous stampede sequence as the volcanic eruption escalates, boldly providing the film\u2019s biggest set-piece at the midway point. Such mass destruction is a new flavour for the Jurassic series, and Bayona wisely punctuates the bombast with human-scale peril.\"\n\nIGN - Gav Murphy\n\n\"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom opens with one of the most exciting set pieces of the year and from there it barely stops for breath as we\u2019re bounced from a huge, high-stakes disaster film to a claustrophobic gothic horror.\"\n\nJurassic World: Fallen Kingdom is in cinemas now", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/06/09/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/06/09/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-2-review-chris-pratt-bryce-dallas-howard-a8385536.html", "title": "Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom review round-up: The verdict is in for JA Bayona's dinosaur sequel", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/films/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "It's a mixed bag of reactions for the follow-up to the 2015 blockbuster", "og": {"updated_time": "2018-06-20T14:50:48.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "The first Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom reviews are in", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/news/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-2-review-chris-pratt-bryce-dallas-howard-a8385536.html", "type": "article", "description": "It's a mixed bag of reactions for the follow-up to the 2015 blockbuster", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/06/09/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/06/09/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-20T14:50:48.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-06-20T14:50:48.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Film", "author_name": "Jacob Stolworthy", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 743, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 6}, "date": "2018-06-20T14:50:48.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176299319"}, "twitter": {"title": "The first Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom reviews are in", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "It's a mixed bag of reactions for the follow-up to the 2015 blockbuster", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/06/09/jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"jurassic world\",\"Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529506248.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
