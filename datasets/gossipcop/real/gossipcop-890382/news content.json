Known for years as Blanket Jackson, he changed his name to Bigi in 2015. The identity of Bigi\u2019s biological mother\u2014a surrogate\u2014is unknown. He was 7 years old when his father died in June 2009.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nFULL NAME: Prince Michael Jackson II\n\nBORN: February 21, 2002\n\nBIRTHPLACE: La Mesa, California\n\nFATHER: Michael Jackson\n\nASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Pisces\n\nEarly Life and Mother\n\nPrince Michael Jackson II was born February 21, 2002. Known as Blanket in his childhood and now Bigi, he is the third child of pop legend Michael Jackson and allegedly the only biological child of the star, but no confirmation has ever been made. The identity of his biological mother, a surrogate, is unknown.\n\nDebbie Rowe, the mother of Michael\u2019s other two children\u2014Paris Michael Katherine and Michael Joseph \u201cPrince\u201d Jackson\u2014publicly denied being Bigi\u2019s biological mother, following his birth and subsequent media speculation regarding his conception.\n\nGetty Images Michael Jackson holds his son Prince Michael Jackson II on a balcony in Berlin.\n\nA famous photograph of Bigi was taken in 2002 when, at only 9 months old, his father dangled him over a balcony in Berlin.\n\nFather\u2019s Death\n\nOn June 25, 2009, Bigi\u2019s father, Michael, suffered cardiac arrest at his home in Los Angeles and died shortly thereafter. The pop star was 50 years old at the time of his death; Prince Michael Jackson II was 7.\n\nBigi\u2019s grandmother, Katherine Jackson, became his legal guardian, as well as the guardian of his siblings, Michael and Paris.\n\nThe three kids spoke to their father\u2019s fans during his funeral in 2009 and again in January 2010 when they accepted a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award for Michael Jackson at the Grammy Awards.\n\nIn February 2010, an official coroner\u2019s report on Michael\u2019s death was released, revealing that the singer had died from acute propofol intoxication. Aided by his personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, Michael had used the drug, among others, to help him sleep.\n\nA police investigation revealed later that Murray hadn\u2019t been licensed to prescribe most controlled medications in California, and the doctor\u2019s actions as Michael\u2019s caretaker were subsequently further scrutinized. Murray was found guilty of homicide on November 7, 2011, receiving a four-year prison sentence.\n\nWrongful Death Lawsuit\n\nBelieving that A.E.G. Live\u2014the entertainment company that promoted Michael Jackson\u2019s planned comeback concert, This Is It, in 2009\u2014had failed to effectively protect the singer while he was under Murray\u2019s care, the Jackson family decided to take legal action against the company. Katherine along with Michael\u2019s three children officially filed a wrongful death lawsuit against A.E.G.\n\nThe trial began in April 2013. Lawyers sought up to $1.5 billion, an estimation of what Michael could have earned over the months since his death if he were still alive, in the case.\n\nIn October 2013, a jury determined that A.E.G. wasn\u2019t responsible for Michael\u2019s death. \u201cAlthough Michael Jackson\u2019s death was a terrible tragedy, it was not a tragedy of A.E.G. Live\u2019s making,\u201d A.E.G.\u2019s lawyer Marvin S. Putnam said.\n\nName Change to Bigi\n\nIn 2015, several reports surfaced that Jackson no longer wished to be called by his nickname Blanket. Radar Online claimed that the young teen now wanted to be addressed as Bigi.\u201d He took the name after being bullied for years for his Blanket moniker.\n\nBigi Jackson Today\n\nJackson lives in Calabasas, California. He attended the Buckley School, a private school in Sherman Oaks, California. Due to his grandmother\u2019s advanced age, along with siblings Michael and Paris leaving the nest as young adults, Jackson was under the supervision of older cousin T.J. Jackson in his later teen years.\n\nWhile sources told People magazine that he had the hardest time of his siblings adjusting after his father\u2019s death, he is now doing well, having focused on grades and sports while in school and spending time with his more than 30 cousins.\n\nAmong Michael\u2019s kids, Bigi has generally stayed out of the spotlight. However, he made a rare appearance at older brother Prince\u2019s graduation from Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles in May 2019. He and Prince also attended the Michael Jackson ONE show at Las Vegas\u2019 Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in August 2023, on what would have been their father\u2019s 65th birthday.\n\nFact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
