While we\u2019re disappointed that Sesame Street does not share in the fun, we are confident in our legal position. We look forward to introducing adult moviegoers to our adorably unapologetic characters this summer,\u201d his statement continued.\n\nSTX Productions\n\nIn their complaint, the Sesame Street creators say their show has spent 50 years building its \u201creputation for wholesome educational programming,\u201d while the trailer for the new film depicts \u201cexplicit, profane, drug-using, misogynistic, violent, copulating, and even ejaculating puppets.\u201d\n\nAccording to the complaint, the film\u2019s explicit content \u201cdiluted and defiled Sesame\u2019s beloved Sesame Street children\u2019s television show.\u201d\n\nWARNING: TRAILER CONTAINS EXPLICIT CONTENT\n\nThe film\u2019s logline describes the movie as \u201ca filthy comedy set in the underbelly of Los Angeles where puppets and humans coexist.\u201d McCarthy stars as a detective who teams up with a puppet private eye to track down a serial killer. In addition to being directed by Henson\u2019s son, the film was produced by The Jim Henson Company\u2019s Henson Alternative banner, On The Day Productions, and was executive produced by Henson\u2019s daughter Lisa Henson.\n\nThe movie has earned substantial buzz, with the R-rated trailer wracking up nearly 1.7 million views on YouTube.\n\nDespite describing the film as \u201cindescribably crude,\u201d the complaint makes clear that Sesame Street is not trying to stop the movie from hitting theaters. \u201cIt is only [the filmmaker\u2019s] deliberate choice to invoke and commercially misappropriate Sesame\u2019s name and goodwill in marketing the movie \u2013 and thereby cause consumers to conclude that Sesame is somehow associated with the movie \u2013 that has infringed on and tarnished the Sesame Street mark and goodwill.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s creators are asking that the filmpull its advertising, in addition to unspecified damages.\n\nThe Happytime Murders, also starring Joel McHale and Elizabeth Banks, is set to hit theaters Aug. 17.", "images":
