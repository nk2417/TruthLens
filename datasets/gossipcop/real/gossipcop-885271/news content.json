The singer-songwriter was 66 years old. As Cyrus said on \"The Howard Stern Show\" Wednesday, \"It's just really hard for me, watching those people that I grew up with leaving.\" She sang a cover of \"Wildflowers,\" telling Howard Stern, \"The reason why I chose this song is because it's hopeful \u2014 it's hopeful rather than mourning.\"\n\nCyrus performed the song again on Jimmy Fallon's late-night show, this time backed by her father, Billy Ray Cyrus. \"You ready, dad?\" Cyrus asked her father before singing the final refrain.\n\n'Tom Petty: A Life in Pictures'\n\nThe \"Younger Now\" singer isn't the only artist to pay tribute to Petty after his death. On Monday, Sheryl Crow dedicated her concert at the espnW Women + Sports Summit to the rocker, and Coldplay brought out R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck to perform one of his classics, \"Free Fallin',\" in Portland. The following night, Steve Earle, Patty Griffin, Emmylou Harris and Dave Matthews got together to cover Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' \"Refugee\" in Seattle.\n\n[NATL]Tom Petty: A Life in Photos\n\nThe Los Angeles County coroner's office completed Petty's autopsy Tuesday, but his cause of death will require further examination. According to reports, he had not seen a doctor in six months. Foul play is not suspected, and toxicology results will not be ready for several weeks.\n\n(E! and NBC are both members of the NBCUniversal family.)\n\nJimmy Fallon plays Casey, who chats with Miley Cyrus as Cassie in a new TV show called \"No Big Deal.\"", "images": ["https://nbcu.tmsimg.com/assets/p26801326_b_h10_aa.jpg?w=960&h=540", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/09/GettyImages-2210941206.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C6000px%2C3375px&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/LA_aerial-1-1.png?fit=2060%2C847&quality=85&strip=all&w=400&h=44&crop=1", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/08/Roku_Channel_Tile_2000x3000_LosAngeles.png?fit=3000%2C2000&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/10/KNBC_Rings_On_Light@3x.png?fit=399%2C120&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/11/GettyImages-2247557456.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2023/06/Raindrop-Rain-Generic-Storms.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/11/anaheim-car-thefts.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/11/GettyImages-2231859499.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/10/KNBC_Rings_On_Dark@3x.png?fit=402%2C120&quality=85&strip=all&w=134&h=40", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/04/LA-web@3x.png?fit=838%2C72&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/01/aguanga-murder-january-2025-victims-Image-1.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2025/11/Video-23-1.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56"], "top_img": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/08/Roku_Channel_Tile_2000x3000_LosAngeles.png?fit=3000%2C2000&quality=85&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zach Johnson"], "canonical_link": "http://www.eonline.com/news/885271/miley-cyrus-and-billy-ray-cyrus-remember-tom-petty-with-wildflowers-cover", "title": "Miley Cyrus and Billy Ray Cyrus Remember Tom Petty With \u2018Wildflowers' Cover", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.6.4", "parsely-title": "Miley Cyrus and Billy Ray Cyrus Remember Tom Petty With \u2018Wildflowers' Cover", "parsely-link": "http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/miley-cyrus-billy-ray-cyrus-tom-petty-cover/2032127/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-10-06T12:00:07Z", "parsely-section": "U.S. & World", "parsely-author": "Zach Johnson", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Los Angeles", "type": "article", "description": "The younger Cyrus invites her father to join her for a \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 performance", "title": "Miley Cyrus and Billy Ray Cyrus Remember Tom Petty With \u2018Wildflowers' Cover", "url": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/miley-cyrus-billy-ray-cyrus-tom-petty-cover/2032127/", "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/08/Roku_Channel_Tile_2000x3000_LosAngeles.png?fit=3000%2C2000&quality=85&strip=all"}, "google-site-verification": "VUQRoXTPcEu2sDqZYyhixp6TJR4J0sph-eMwFDkbaps", "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nbcla", "creator": "@nbcla", "description": "The younger Cyrus invites her father to join her for a \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 performance", "title": "Miley Cyrus and Billy Ray Cyrus Remember Tom Petty With \u2018Wildflowers' Cover", "url": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/miley-cyrus-billy-ray-cyrus-tom-petty-cover/2032127/", "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2024/08/Roku_Channel_Tile_2000x3000_LosAngeles.png?fit=3000%2C2000&quality=85&strip=all"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "description": "The younger Cyrus invites her father to join her for a \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 performance", "sailthru.title": "Miley Cyrus and Billy Ray Cyrus Remember Tom Petty With \u2018Wildflowers' Cover", "sailthru.description": "The younger Cyrus invites her father to join her for a \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 performance", "sailthru.type": "article", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-06T05:00:07+00:00", "parsely-network-canonical": "http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/national-international/miley-cyrus-billy-ray-cyrus-tom-petty-cover/2053244/", "taboola_lead": "video", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/cropped-NBC_LA.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=85&strip=all"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/8QF1alJRw-c"], "publish_date": 1507266007.0, "source": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com", "summary": ""}
