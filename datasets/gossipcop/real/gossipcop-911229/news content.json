He will sing his hit, \u201cCan\u2019t Stop the Feeling,\u201d there won\u2019t be an \u2018NSYNC reunion (or a Janet Jackson appearance or Prince hologram performance) and he\u2019ll be dressed in head-to-toe Stella McCartney.\n\nThe designer released a statement on Friday announcing that the star will be wearing custom designed pieces for his big night. And based on the sketches, there will be two different looks which vibe with the aesthetic of his new album Man of the Woods.\n\nCourtesy Stella McCartney\n\nThe first is a Prince of Wales check and camouflage splatter-print suit featuring a red bandana neck tie accessory. And the second includes the same camo pants with a black fringe jacket and organic cotton shirt featuring landscape artwork by British artist Martin Ridley.\n\nCourtesy Stella McCartney\n\nAccording to the release, the designer drew inspiration from Timberlake\u2019s new album Man of the Woods. And to celebrate the release of his new album, Timberlake wore a red crewneck Stella McCartney sweater to a listening session on Thursday in Minnesota.\n\nAlso repping the brand? Timberlake\u2019s bestie, Jimmy Fallon, who shared an Instagram of his new Stella McCartney glue-free, black knit high-top sneakers with neon green accents kicks. \u201cGo Stella!\u201d he captioned the photo.\n\nHe may have also received a furry piece, because he snapped a pic of the tag and applauded her work of using fur-free fur. Maybe the fuzzy find will make an appearance during Fallon\u2019s special Tonight Show episode from Minnesota following the game?\n\nWeeks ago, Timberlake teased his new album in a video and said that his inspiration for the songs came from his family. \u201cThis album is really inspired by my son, my wife, my family, but more so than any other album I\u2019ve written, where I\u2019m from,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s personal.\u201d\n\nJustin Timberlake Dances with Wife Jessica Biel in New Music Video \u2018Man of the Woods\u2019\n\nHis family makes appears in his music videos and the album was even named after his son, Silas. During a conversation with Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo of N.E.R.D., he brought up the origin of his son\u2019s name and learned that it meant \u201cman of the woods.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were having all these discussions and [Williams] goes, \u2018Man, you know what, that\u2019s a really really good name for a song.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018That\u2019s a really good name for an album.'\u201d\n\nAnd his family will be on the sidelines cheering him on during his big night. For his birthday earlier this week, wife Jessica Biel wrote a sweet message to him on Instagram.\n\n\u201cA picture says a thousand words. And thank goodness because there aren\u2019t enough to express ALL the aspects of my love and respect for you\u201d she wrote. \u201cHere\u2019s to a spectacular year ahead. I\u2019m so proud of all you\u2019ve accomplished and all that is ahead for you. plus you\u2019re a super hot dad. A ninja dad. A kiddie teeth brushing, Jedi sleep mind tricking, intimidating dad voice disciplining SUPER HOT DAD. I love you, you hot dad.. I\u2019m here, right by your side, OG fan girl #1. Happy birthday, my beloved. Now go crush it this weekend at SB LII.\u201d\n\nSuper Bowl LII will be played Sunday, Feb. 4 at the U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis, Minnesota and will air live on NBC.", "images":
