I LOVE U!!! SELFIE OR HUG?\"\n\nAs soon as he saw it, he invited Cruz to join him onstage. \"You beat cancer twice, I gotta give you at least a hug,\" he exclaimed. \"You must know, you beat cancer twice, you can do anything. In those dark times, you just remember to smile. Always smile!\"\n\nIn an adorable moment captured by fans on social media, HOVA wrapped his arms around Cruz for a sweet hug. They also shared a brief chat before she was exited off stage.\n\nFollowing the show, one of Cruz's friends took to Instagram to share a video of her pal on the big screen with Jay-Z.\n\n\"My bestie got to meet #Jayz last night!\" she captioned it. \"#fuckcancer #shesASurvivor#444tour ? #sheLovesHim #christinacruz#jayzconcert #jayz444tour.\"\n\n\n\nIt doesn't get much sweeter than that!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2020-03/gettyimages-462328115_0.jpg?h=56d0ca2e&width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-10/jay_z_gettyimages-161422885.jpg?h=f0e678b6&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/jay_z_tidal_x_gettyimages-862713306.jpg?h=8c0ed12c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/jay_z_tidal_x_gettyimages-862713306.jpg?h=8c0ed12c&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-11/1280_jay_z_beyonce_gettyimages-635003128.jpg?h=e1c608cd&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/jay_z_tidal_x_gettyimages-862713306.jpg?h=8c0ed12c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/jay-z-stops-concert-meet-two-time-cancer-survivor-pics-92880", "title": "Jay-Z Stops Concert to Meet Two-Time Cancer Survivor: Pics!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/jay_z_tidal_x_gettyimages-862713306.jpg?h=8c0ed12c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The rapper haulted his show in Oakland, California, on Saturday to bring a female fan in the audience on stage.", "title": "Jay-Z Stops Concert to Meet Two-Time Cancer Survivor: Pics!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jay-z-stops-concert-meet-two-time-cancer-survivor-pics-92880", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The rapper haulted his show in Oakland, California, on Saturday to bring a female fan in the audience on stage.", "twitter": {"description": "The rapper haulted his show in Oakland, California, on Saturday to bring a female fan in the audience on stage.", "title": "Jay-Z Stops Concert to Meet Two-Time Cancer Survivor: Pics!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/jay-z-stops-concert-meet-two-time-cancer-survivor-pics-92880", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/jay_z_tidal_x_gettyimages-862713306.jpg?h=8c0ed12c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Jay-Z Stops Concert to Meet Two-Time Cancer Survivor: Pics! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, Music, News, Jay Z", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
