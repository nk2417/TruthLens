Among other things, Lauer allegedly gave a female colleague a sex toy, accompanied by a note saying that he wanted to use it on her. \"As a general rule, if you're giving someone a dildo at work, you're the dildo at work,\" Meyers said.\n\nHe also took issue with someone installing a button under Lauer's desk that let him lock the door without getting up \u2014 \"if someone asks you to install a button under their desk, just nod and then report it to the police\" \u2014 and scoffed at Lauer's purported fondness for a game of \"F\u2014k, Marry, or Kill.\" \"I don't know who you said you'd marry in those conversations, but I do know you killed your career and f\u2014ked yourself,\" he said. Meyers didn't just go off on Lauer \u2014 he also had words for men who think unsuspecting women want to see them in their underwear (they don't) and President Trump, who isn't making a whole lot of sense these days.
