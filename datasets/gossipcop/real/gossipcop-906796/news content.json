a special clinic that cares for kids with rare and complex conditions and helps support their families.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHelping to welcome them was 6-year-old Tiana Yales, who is being treated for sickle cell anaemia and was chosen to present a bouquet to the royal mum.\n\nAfter giving Kate the flowers and shaking her hand, Tiana smiled as she did a very swift curtsy.\n\n(Credit:

Christmas-themed fun.\n\nLater in the day the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge toured a central London centre run by The Passage.\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge has spoken out against the scourge of the drug Spice after hearing about its devastating effect on the capital\u2019s homeless.\n\nWilliam and Kate were left moved by the problems the illegal synthetic high is causing rough sleepers \u2013 and usage is increasing according to homeless charity The Passage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\nDuring the visit the Duke told Mick Clarke, chief executive of The Passage: \u201cThe fact it was a legal high and that young people were allowed to take it and it leads to addiction is just terrible.\u201d\n\nThe synthetic drug is seen as a growing problem, and the biggest challenge the homeless charity faces is that it is cheap, readily available and can exacerbate existing problems like poor mental health.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Passage carried out a survey of its homeless clients and found 50% had tried the drug at least once in 2016 \u2013 when this study was repeated this year the figure had increased to 70%.\n\n(Credit: Getty)\n\nAfter giving the couple a private briefing on Spice Mr Clarke said: \u201cThere was real empathy that came from both the duke and duchess, they very much care about the issue and I think it marks the way they care about the poorest in society and they take their responsibility to raise those issues, to give it the profile that\u2019s needed, very seriously.\n\n\u201cI think they genuinely get it in terms of the stuff they\u2019ve done around, say, Heads Together (mental health campaign) and I think they really appreciated hearing first hand the terrible effects of Spice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHow cheap it is to just get, how readily available it is, I think they were shocked and I think it really brought home this is a drug that targets the poorest of the poor.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re on the streets it doesn\u2019t get much worse but if you\u2019re on the streets and then you\u2019re taking something that literally one puff could hospitalise you, in some cases lead to your death or make you out to be a zombie stereotype figure.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of talk around how we break the cycle of addiction, mental health and homelessness.\u201d\n\nLoading the player...\n\nAdvertisement", "images":
