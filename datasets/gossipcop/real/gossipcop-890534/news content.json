Called TruFusion, it offers more than 65 styles of instruction and 35 to 40 daily classes in yoga, Pilates, kettlebell exercises, and battle-rope workouts in heated rooms.\n\nLast June, Rodriguez purchased a major stake in the company, and now owns the development rights for all of Florida. President and C.O.O. Jonathan Fornaci says the classes can be so hard that he sees some professional athletes take breaks during them, but \u201cAlex kills it. And immediately afterward he\u2019s drilling down, asking questions that any private-equity analyst would be asking.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m warned that the \u201cDown N Dirty Bootcamp\u201d will be hard and sweaty, and it is precisely as advertised. At one point, confused by the welter of instructions\u2014Left! Right! Kettlebell! Weight! Sandbag!\u2014I look over at Lopez and roll my eyes in desperation. \u201cI get confused, too,\u201d she says. \u201cJust watch everyone else.\u201d During some particularly brutal leg lifts, I give up. She does not. In fact, she starts singing. At the end, we\u2019re all sitting on our mats, drenched in sweat and exhausted. Journey\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u201d\u2019 is playing.\n\nLiving the Dream\n\nIt\u2019s clear as day that neither of them is hitting Pause. After Vegas, she\u2019s off to New York, where her children are in school, and he\u2019s off to Atlanta, where he\u2019s filming a pilot for a CNBC reality show that will help retired athletes who are struggling financially. Rodriguez says he keeps himself grounded with some key words: \u201cGratitude and appreciation. When someone offers me a job, I thank the Lord that I have work, and I beg for more work.\u201d\n\nAnd he adds, \u201cWe\u2019re really good at reminding each other.\u201d They begin to tell me a story, one in which Lopez is in the bath, and Rodriguez is sitting by the fire in a robe. Looking at my face, he starts laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re like, \u2018Where are you going with this story, and is it going to get R-rated?\u2019 \u201d But it\u2019s not R-rated, not at all. He says he got hot from the fire and went to sit on the patio outside their room, with a book and his feet up, in the crisp air. Lopez breaks in. \u201cI came out and said, \u2018What are you doing out here?\u2019 He said, \u2018Living the dream.\u2019 \u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e545ba52f252468160b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fbde150b3b961d91154947/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68f935ac63cdeb4553297504/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f36396ddf784604d17e8eb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss06.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e36cac48e51f42566b391/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639540dfcc68ac21c0d3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690391f1eebf6e975f3db06f/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69121562183bbbb5eb312f87/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5847108b9dee4a361369e3fe/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639616ff751cf425ef2c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss05.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f363955ba52f25246815cd/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6915f5869e297cb897143240/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691b63b86201973f77db4e40/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e12eca31582bb6e461be9/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6912033f02774bc2b727aee4/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6904b792447a00332ceb4fd3/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e5225b7a40d71fd1688/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690a5ee0da787343f1849201/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639525b7a40d71fd1638/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss04.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639540dfcc68ac21c0d4/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss01.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e545ba52f252468160b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bethany Mclean", "Mario Testino", "Jessica Diehl"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/10/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-cover-story", "title": "J-Rod!
