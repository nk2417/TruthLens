I was depressed and kind of just upset at the world.\"\n\n\"She was what I needed,\" he added. \"She was someone I could talk to. I mean, basically a therapist. Somebody I could trust with \u2026 Worries about, Can I make it? Worries about what I\u2019m going through to get back.\"\n\nJustin Verlander and Kate Upton attend Maxim Hot 100 Experience in Los Angeles, July 21, 2018.

Being in that industry? Being that famous? That was a level I hadn\u2019t dealt with,\" he said.\n\nAlong with a blossoming romance, Verlander got great news around that time four years ago, he didn't need surgery, but yet the pain continued. It was Upton who suggested an idea that was out of the box.\n\n\"As a woman, you learn to always question everything everyone is telling you. My industry? My perspective of things? We can\u2019t depend on anyone. Everything is our responsibility,\" she said, adding she told him to find help outside of his baseball trainers.\n\nAfter finding Dr. Annie Gow, she discovered that his problem wasn't in his shoulder at all, but that he wasn't flexible after his groin surgery. Basically he had changed his throwing motion to compensate for years and says, \"My body was a disaster.\"\n\nFor three months, the doctor and the pitcher worked on changing his whole technique.\n\nFast forward a couple of years and a new team in the Houston Astros, Verlander was back and better than ever exciting. But Verlander had also proposed to the love of his life and a run at the World Series would interfere with the duo's dream wedding.\n\nSo, in storybook fashion, Verlander and the Houston Astros won the series in seven games, then hopped on a jet to their wedding destination.\n\nVerlander and Upton said in hindsight, they wouldn't have planned it any other way.", "images": ["https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/bf2f8ed5-a320-4d7e-b583-179abe072d92/trump-signs-shutdown-bill-20251112-ap-jh_1763006747268_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/justin-verlander-kate-upton-gty-ml-180810_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg?w=992", "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/a904a3c1-1e2d-4174-9130-e846e8059dee/carnivaldeath_1762746067738_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/justin-verlander-kate-upton1-sh-ml-180810_hpEmbed_9x13_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/random/svg/gma_logo.svg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/58243adb-8803-4755-967b-fd4054af3f72/comey-gty-er-251118_1763492478230_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/justin-verlander-kate-upton-gty-ml-180810_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/b99f9e96-eab3-4778-9eed-25bd727d8e1f/donald-trump-2-gty-gmh-251119_1763557323762_hpMain_square.jpg?w=208", "https://assets-cdn.abcotvs.net/static/images/DisneyPlus.svg"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/justin-verlander-kate-upton-gty-ml-180810_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/kate-upton-love-brought-justin-verlander-back-brink/story?id=57134535", "title": "How Kate Upton, love, brought Justin Verlander back from the brink", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=yes", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "ABC News", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/kate-upton-love-brought-justin-verlander-back-brink/story?id=57134535", "title": "How Kate Upton, love, brought Justin Verlander back from the brink", "description": "\"She was what I needed,\" the pitcher gushes about his amazing wife.", "image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/justin-verlander-kate-upton-gty-ml-180810_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "type": "article"}, "description": "\"She was what I needed,\" the pitcher gushes about his amazing wife.", "keywords": "kate upton, justin verlander, Article, 57134535", "theme-color": "#fff", "copyright": "2025 ABC News", "author": "ABC News", "robots": "index, follow", "fb": {"admins": 704409894, "app_id": 4942312939, "pages": 55845270277}, "fb_title": "How Kate Upton, love, brought Justin Verlander back from the brink", "lastPublishedDate": "2018-08-10T19:23:09Z", "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "ABC News", "ipad": "ABC News", "googleplay": "ABC News"}, "id": {"iphone": 300255638, "ipad": 306934135, "googleplay": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,57134535", "ipad": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,57134535", "googleplay": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/kate-upton-love-brought-justin-verlander-back-brink/story?id=57134535"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ABC", "creator": "ABC News", "title": "How Kate Upton, love, brought Justin Verlander back from the brink", "description": "\"She was what I needed,\" the pitcher gushes about his amazing wife.", "url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/kate-upton-love-brought-justin-verlander-back-brink/story?id=57134535", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/justin-verlander-kate-upton-gty-ml-180810_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg?w=1600", "width": 640, "height": 360}}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "abcnewsiphone://link/prism-story,57134535", "app_store_id": 300255638, "app_name": "ABC News - Breaking US & World News"}, "ipad": {"url": "abcnewsipad://link/prism-story,57134535", "app_store_id": 380520716, "app_name": "ABC News for ipad"}, "android": {"url": "android-app://com.abc.abcnews/abcnews/abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/kate-upton-love-brought-justin-verlander-back-brink/story?id=57134535", "app_name": "ABC News Breaking Latest News", "package": "com.abc.abcnews"}, "web": {"url": "https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Culture/kate-upton-love-brought-justin-verlander-back-brink/story?id=57134535"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://abcnews.go.com", "summary": ""}
