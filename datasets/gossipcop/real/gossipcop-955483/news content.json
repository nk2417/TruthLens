Wait, who?\n\nIn the final moments of the \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Apocalypse\u201d premiere, Ryan Murphy fans were reintroduced to \u201cAssassination of Gianni Versace\u201d star Cody Fern in his debut \u201cAHS\u201d role as Langdon, a man with epic hair who has come to save Wilhelmina Venable (Sarah Paulson) and the other survivors in her nuclear shelter. Well, not all of them, just those he deems worthy after examination. Devilish, no?\n\nThough Fern himself is new to the franchise, the name of the character he\u2019s playing on the big \u201cMurder House\u201d-\u201cCoven\u201d crossover might ring a bell to you, as he has been an important part in the series since its beginning. Allow us to explain.\n\nSeason 1 of the long-running FX anthology series centered around the Harmon family \u2014 Dr. Ben (Dylan McDermott), Vivien (Connie Britton) and their daughter Violet (Taissa Farmiga) \u2014 and their nosey next door neighbor, Constance Langdon (Jessica Lange).\n\nThe Harmons move into the titular Murder House at the start of the season, after Ben is caught cheating on his wife and the couple tries to pick up the pieces. The 12-episode installment ran through the past and present horrors that occurred in the house, including Vivien being impregnated via rape by Tate, Constance\u2019s dead teenage son (played by Evan Peters) who is stuck inside the Murder House with the other ghosts.\n\nIn the penultimate episode, Vivien died giving birth to two babies (one Tate\u2019s, one her husband\u2019s). Constance managed to snatch one of the boys, her grandson, after Dr. Ben was murdered by his former lover Hayden. Constance took the child, whom she later named Michael, and fled Los Angeles.\n\nThe other baby (Ben\u2019s child) took one breath before dying and was reunited with his parents and sister in death. Yes, the whole Harmon clan kicked the bucket by the end of the finale, with us learning Violet had actually died of an overdose earlier in the season and was a ghost all that time.\n\nNow Michael is a special boy, as a medium called Billie Dean Howard (Paulson) explained a child born of ghost and human would be the Antichrist himself, destined to usher in the End of Days. The \u201cMurder House\u201d finale flashed forward to give us a preview of that mess, when Constance found a three-year-old Michael, covered in blood, having murdered his nanny. And the two laugh over the moment.\n\nWhen Murphy announced Fern\u2019s casting over the summer, he revealed he was playing a grownup version of Michael Langdon. And with Britton, McDermott, Farmiga and Lange all set to reprise their \u201cMurder House\u201d roles this season, so we\u2019re really hoping for a hellish family reunion.\n\n\u201cAmerican Horror Story: Apocalypse\u201d airs Wednesday at 10/9c on FX.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?fit=53%2C58&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/5x4_082025_COVER_B.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AHS-Apocalypse-Michael-Langdon-1.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AHS-Apocalypse-Michael-Langdon-1.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Maas", "Tv Reporter", "Jennifer.Maas Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/american-horror-story-apocalypse-who-is-michael-langdon-ahs-cody-fern/", "title": "\u2018American Horror Story: Apocalypse\u2019: Yes, Mr Langdon Is THAT \u2018Murder House\u2019 Character", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'American Horror Story: Apocalypse': Yes, Mr Langdon Is THAT 'Murder House' Character", "description": "Cody Fern may be new to \"AHS,\" but his character dates back to Season 1", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/american-horror-story-apocalypse-who-is-michael-langdon-ahs-cody-fern/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AHS-Apocalypse-Michael-Langdon-1.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/png"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2018-09-17T00:10:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-09-17T00:10:27+00:00"}, "author": "Jennifer Maas", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Jennifer Maas", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "american_horror_story, american-horror-story-apocalypse, cody-fern, ryan-murphy, sarah_paulson", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "culture, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1537143009.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
