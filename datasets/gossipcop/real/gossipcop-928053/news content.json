Over the weekend, the Dance Moms star updated her followers on her recovery process, sharing a photo on Instagram of the scars and stitches from her recent operations.\n\n\"After the 2nd surgery, My back is finally on the mend,\" Miller wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"I just wish the top section & bottom would hurry along too! I had 52 staples perfectly aligned and now a bunch of crazy stitches are holding my neck & lumbar region together!\" the dance instructor captioned the photo.\n\nAs seen in the picture, Miller has an incision running all the way from her neck to her lower back. And while the majority of the cut has already healed over, stitches from the second surgery, at the top and bottom of her back, are still fully visible.\n\nIn April, a few weeks after her first surgery, Miller shared a photo of her post-op scar, and those \"52 staples perfectly aligned,\" on Instagram. \"This gives a whole new meaning to being stabbed in the back!\" she joked in the caption.\n\nAnd in early June, Miller explained on Instagram that she had undergone the second operation.\n\nMiller first underwent emergency spinal surgery in April after experiencing severe neck pain and weakness in her arm.", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/5b3a49f3ee9fbc4733481306/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-683170296.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/5b3a7098ee9fbc473348132b/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/abby-lee-miller-recovery.jpg", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self-us/assets/logo-header.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/5b3a7098ee9fbc473348132b/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/abby-lee-miller-recovery.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrea Park"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/abby-lee-miller-back-surgery-scar-photo", "title": "After a Second Back Surgery, Abby Lee Miller Shows Off Her Healing Progress on Instagram", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Andrea Park", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "After undergoing a second back surgery to treat her non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Abby Lee Miller wrote on Instagram that she is \"finally on the mend.\"", "id": "5b3a4518ee9fbc4733481304", "keywords": "abby lee miller,cancer,pain management,news,leukemia and lymphoma,lymphoma,leukemia & lymphoma", "news_keywords": "abby lee miller,cancer,pain management,news,leukemia and lymphoma,lymphoma,leukemia & lymphoma", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b3a4518ee9fbc4733481304", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"After undergoing a second back surgery to treat her non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Abby Lee Miller wrote on Instagram that she is \\\"finally on the mend.\\\"\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/5b3a49f3ee9fbc4733481306/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-683170296.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/5b3a49f3ee9fbc4733481306/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-683170296.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "She's \"finally on the mend.\"", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/5b3a7098ee9fbc473348132b/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/abby-lee-miller-recovery.jpg", "site_name": "SELF", "title": "After a Second Back Surgery, Abby Lee Miller Shows Off Her Healing Progress on Instagram", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.self.com/story/abby-lee-miller-back-surgery-scar-photo"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-07-02T17:34:15.803Z", "modified_time": "2018-07-02T17:34:15.803Z", "author": "Andrea Park"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SELFmagazine", "description": "She's \"finally on the mend.\"", "domain": "https://www.self.com", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/5b3a7098ee9fbc473348132b/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/abby-lee-miller-recovery.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@SELFmagazine", "title": "After a Second Back Surgery, Abby Lee Miller Shows Off Her Healing Progress on Instagram"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.self.com/photos/5b3a7098ee9fbc473348132b/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/abby-lee-miller-recovery.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169640983205651, "pages": 8908243810}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530552855.803, "source": "https://www.self.com", "summary": ""}
