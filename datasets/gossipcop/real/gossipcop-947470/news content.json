{"url": "https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-most-american-songs-ever", "text": "Here\u2019s the thing, there\u2019s basically two Americas. One half loves Kid Rock. I mean, they cannot get enough of the guy. The other half thinks the half that likes Kid Rock are fucking morons. That\u2019s basically it.\n\nBut let us not condemn the US for its differences, let us instead give thanks for some of the fantastic shit we invented, like bubblegum and Evel Knievel and action movies\u2026 and rock\u2019n\u2019roll.\n\nDavid Lee Roth - Yankee Rose\n\nIn 1986 David Lee Roth found himself untethered from Van Halen and to celebrate, he wrote a song about wanting to have sex with America. The whole country. All at once. And that\u2019s pretty much what he did. Say what you will, but we really nailed it when we created Diamond Dave.\n\nNight Ranger - You Can Still Rock In America\n\nThis one always gets short shrift since it\u2019s on the same album as the undeniably amazing power-ballad Sister Christian, but good ol\u2019 Night Ranger perfectly captured the plastic-fantastic mall-crawling faux-fun of mainstream 80\u2019s America on this one. Night Ranger was never cool, and neither is this song, really, but not everybody was cool back then. The squares needed a rock anthem too. This is it.\n\nDon Mclean - American Pie\n\nAn eight minute epic that begins with the plane crash that killed Buddy Holly and ends with the entire history of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, Mclean\u2019s masterful ode to America\u2019s greatest contribution to culture is so good nobody can ever turn it off until it\u2019s over. Seriously, there are people sitting in their driveways right now letting dinner get cold, waiting for the \u2018Did you write the book of love?\u2019 part.\n\nGrand Funk - We\u2019re An American Band\n\n1973 was probably the greatest year in rock\u2019n\u2019roll history and this was pretty much the greatest hit of 1973 so, I mean, you do the math. The beauty of this song is that it doesn\u2019t matter who or where you are when you hear it, it just draws you in. You\u2019re part of it. For its duration, we\u2019re all an American band, man.\n\nJohn Cougar Mellencamp - Pink Houses\n\nJohn Cougar Mellencamp hasn\u2019t been working class since 1980 at least, but the dude understands small-town America better than just about anybody, and this enduring gem from his breakout \u201883 album Uh-Huh remains an inspiration for any Americans optimistic enough to think things\u2019ll get better someday. It could happen.\n\nClassic Rock Newsletter Sign up below to get the latest from Classic Rock, plus exclusive special offers, direct to your inbox!

Hell, it might even be a tragedy (\u201cGod it\u2019s so painful when something that\u2019s so close is still so far out of reach\u201d), but Tom Petty\u2019s plaintive power-pop has always struck a deep rootsy chord with US audiences, and this one just feels like home.\n\nBruce Springsteen - Born in the USA\n\nWe all know it\u2019s actually a protest song. You don\u2019t have to keep telling us that. We still like it. Born in the USA endures because it is entirely emblematic of the country it\u2019s singing about: conflicted, wounded, weary, worried and ragged, but still standing. Our modern national anthem, basically.\n\nLyrnyrd Skynyrd - Freebird\n\nThere is a fairly reasonable argument that \u201creal\u201d America can\u2019t be found in our crowded, bustling cities on the coasts, that the authentic, true-blue, soaring eagle America is boiling away down south. And if you wanna know what that sounds like, it sounds like fucking Freebird. People request it at every gig regardless of the band on stage for a reason. It\u2019s magnificent. And this bird you cannot change.\n\nNeil Young - Rockin\u2019 In The Free World\n\nAs with Springsteen\u2019s tune, this is another America-centric song that wraps troubled verses around a soaring chorus. And once again, we\u2019re aware. You get three hundred million people together, a couple of them are going to put babies in garbage cans. But the rest of us? We\u2019re still - that\u2019s right - rockin\u2019 in the free world.\n\nKid Rock - American Bad Ass\n\nListen, I get it. I\u2019m part of that other half I mentioned in the intro. Out of all the terrible ideas the USA has had, rap-metal has to be in the top five. But Kid Rock is so quintessentially American that he basically bleeds Coca-Cola. And this song is so quintessentially American that it needs to tell you it\u2019s American over and over. I mean, love it or leave it, man.", "images": ["https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZ7LiZFoqtN7VQNZD5QXtc.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M6v3Mttp3pdF8s7nzqNzwV.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FG6N4CAAFEt3oqXN6oDxdH.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xwJsLstvbuScwbQmKsXWdL.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ApnYpLCNazBD2QhKxg8PD.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/flexiimages/mednnv697g1760357120.png", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C7WrnQbXtvNwkEKeV8Ckbm.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2k8gHtnHsvEEGHwqbmUDYV.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sYraeDo9kyqHPxy73W3ULJ.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pZVZ63Rr5bVePpSBMvinj.png", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WtSgfzW46L6rHgcEXNvGkj.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KHGDMXefxeTFn4in58b2wG.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FQbEZiVwhEXHSgCvwcdf6R.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LswmwkHmedf6wQhaEc7396.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p/?c1=2&c2=10055482&cv=4.4.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NqW3SnyAZXHxqwHgWAdxTR-1280-80.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DCYjExbDzhPvHwiJvz36R5.jpg", "https://images.fie.futurecdn.net/fgj1r0yj62gelw0f-16742129324619-250-80.png.webp", "https://www.loudersound.com/media/img/classic-rock.svg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kJw7MHGwfc3XGAEsW69z9D.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GtpDxgJpJXVYgqczdSthQW.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wPytaW4TJne6bbomXUF4FJ.png", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4K53KTwfyr4ULsYkmhE4kn.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VoBrCwppCMu9TcGKDeFpQo.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NqW3SnyAZXHxqwHgWAdxTR.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T93pSybbiFPyCYanKgZ8Bm.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ExMmEhQkgjrHsBgD9uYChZ.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SCE6tR7Arx7ui4ySc9u2WU.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/guN47KcyLJThmo7uugpnPH.png", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pTkxDA77EYeCAcEASAAeBV.png", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/frTSFg5oJXMWWvVxLJhp9g.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iviMHDH6mPMPyEAhHnUQDG.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YijrocknhU99Q5VPmfLBCh.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ckov93Z5eamAu4GRFd54SB.png", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sWzysVsLRibs8jntx8gEJ8.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NqW3SnyAZXHxqwHgWAdxTR-1280-80.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-most-american-songs-ever", "title": "The 10 most American songs ever", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "pub_date": "2019-07-04T12:38:02+00:00", "description": "10 classic tracks celebrating America in all its star-spangled and/or faded glory", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/loudersound/1476056/apple-touch-icon.png", "og": {"site_name": "Louder", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NqW3SnyAZXHxqwHgWAdxTR-1280-80.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "type": "article", "title": "The 10 most American songs ever", "url": "https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-most-american-songs-ever", "description": "10 classic tracks celebrating America in all its star-spangled and/or faded glory"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ClassicRockMagazine/", "published_time": "2019-07-04T12:38:02Z", "modified_time": "2023-07-04T02:46:37Z"}, "mrf": {"tags": "region:GB;articleType:Features;channel:Music listening;control:type_listicle;control:apple-news-format;control:serversidehawk;control:van-enable-adviser-more-about;category:Tracks & Singles;category:Music;unindexedFreeform:Classic Rock;source:Classic Rock"}, "fb": {"app_id": 235441786508054}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@ClassicRockMag", "title": "The 10 most American songs ever", "description": "10 classic tracks celebrating America in all its star-spangled and/or faded glory", "creator": "@ClassicRockMag", "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NqW3SnyAZXHxqwHgWAdxTR-1200-80.jpg", "account_id": 15560223}, "google-site-verification": "8YCPNbGtymiD3k0H7gqevgAN-a7OhH_3GVeHZgw5byA", "p": {"domain_verify": "7746212808ec7b4a7e3417956fbc5b73"}, "msvalidate.01": "CC462E6DF91492086145CA5EBDCB615E", "theme-color": "#dc0f17", "vf": {"container_id": "3x5HA9XauPPXzxjFVe2Ln3"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1562243882.0, "source": "https://www.loudersound.com", "summary": ""}
