The snippet was used to rev the audience during the the pre-game. The \u201cReputation\u201d album has a Nov. 10 release date.\n\nEarlier in the week the first \u201cReputation\u201d single, \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d released Aug. 25, was used to promote the same Florida v. Alabama game.\n\nAre you #readyforit? No. 1 Alabama. No. 3 Florida State. Right NOW on ABC and streaming live on the ESPN App. pic.twitter.com/pojroWJRHL \u2014 ESPN (@espn) September 3, 2017\n\nThat release shattered multiple records, paving the way for a season of Swift. It\u2019s unknown whether her sports foray is a feint at rival pop queen Katy Perry, whose basketball themed \u201cSwish Swish\u201d was released in May, followed by a hoop-themed music video in August.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d was also featured in ABC\u2019s Thursday night TGIT lineup promos that began airing the day the single dropped, concurrent with a steady push on social media, with accounts for ABC\u2019s three TGIT shows pumping hashtags for #TGITaylor, #Reputation and #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=30&v=tbVhoCr0Rao\n\nThat culminated in Shonda Rhimes, who produces the TGIT shows, tweeting out a mention of Swift and her new single. Swift makes no secret of the fact that she is a big fan of the Rhimes-produced \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy.\u201d Adweek reports Swift named her cat Meredith after a character on the show played by Ellen Pompeo, who appeared in Swift\u2019s 2014 \u201cBad Blood\u201d video.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/taylor-swift.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/taylor-swift.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Variety Staff", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/taylor-swift-teases-ready-for-it-espn-football-1202546044/", "title": "Taylor Swift Teases New Song, \u2018Ready For It,\u2019 with ESPN College Football", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Taylor Swift surprised fans teasing the new song \"Ready For I,\" during the lead-in to ESPN's Florida State vs. Alabama football game.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Variety Staff", "tags": "Reputation, Taylor Swift", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Taylor Swift Teases New Song, \u2018Ready For It,\u2019 with ESPN College Football", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/music/news/taylor-swift-teases-ready-for-it-espn-football-1202546044/", "description": "Taylor Swift surprised fans teasing the new song \"Ready For I,\" during the lead-in to ESPN's Florida State vs. Alabama football game.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/taylor-swift.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Taylor Swift"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-03T04:11:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-09-03T17:29:09+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Taylor Swift surprised fans teasing the new song \"Ready For I,\" during the lead-in to ESPN's Florida State vs. Alabama football game.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@Variety", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Taylor Swift Teases New Song, \u2018Ready For It,\u2019 with ESPN College Football", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/taylor-swift.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504411888.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
