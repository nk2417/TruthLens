Probably, it was just that she didn\u2019t get enough votes... so I can assuage my guilt and throw The Bella Army under the bus.\n\nEither way, Nikki Bella\u2019s time on Dancing With The Stars came to an abrupt end during their Halloween Night episode on Oct. 30.\n\nHer witchcraft-themed jive with professional partner Artem Chigvintsev didn\u2019t wow the judges, who placed them near the bottom of the eight remaining teams with a 24.\n\nThe duo also competed in a group dance with three other couples, and that didn\u2019t impress the panel either. Their corn maze-themed number earning the same score (24), while the other eight dancers nailed their Phantom of the Opera riff to the tune of a perfect 30.\n\nNikki and Artem were among four pairs under the axe at the end. Not bad odds, especially considering fan voting came after a strong showing last week. But when host Tom Bergeron revealed it would be a double elimination... the longest reigning Divas champion in WWE history was done dancing, along with Vanessa Lachey and her pro.\n\nThough the Mirror Ball trophy won\u2019t be Bella\u2019s, she does have the love of a good man...\n\n... and the season premiere of yet another show, Total Divas, coming up on Wednesday, Nov. 1. So things aren\u2019t bad at all.\n\nC\u2019MON GREAT JOB NIKKI!", "images":
