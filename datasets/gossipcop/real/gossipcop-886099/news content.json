She was later found at the house of another man. The two exchanged barbs throughout the years, and in a September 2017 interview with the Daily Mail, Chelsea said she was pregnant, expecting her first child with husband Nick Alliegro, and that she didn't want O'Donnell to be a part of her baby's life. Chelsea said she and O'Donnell didn't \"have a relationship anymore\" and she didn't think \"it [could] be mended.\"\n\nIn June, however, O'Donnell's rep told ET that the mother and daughter had reconnected, and just days later, ET learned that Chelsea had filed for separation from Alliegro. The pair's split came following social media posts indicating that Chelsea is pregnant with her boyfriend, Jacob Bourassa.\n\nDuring her appearance on The Talk, O'Donnell also opened up about another daughter, Dakota, and how her 2016 diagnosis with autism influenced the actress' battle with panic attacks.\n\n\"It\u2019s been worse since my daughter got diagnosed with autism. I have a 5 and half year old, and the first day that I was in the meeting and they said, \u2018No, she does have autism\u2019\u2026 I got slop sweat like William Hurt in Broadcast News. I was like dripping and my heart was going,\" O'Donnell shared. \"It all revolves around trying to protect her from being vulnerable and knowing that there\u2019s only so much that I can do as a mom.\"\n\nSee more on O'Donnell in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2016-06/1280_rosie_odonnell_chelsea_541900858_062116.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/rosie_o_donnell_gettyimages-950606828.jpg?h=93e29675&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2017-12/blac_chyna_rob_kardashian_getty530516160.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/rosie_o_donnell_gettyimages-950606828.jpg?h=93e29675", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-06/rosie_o_donnell_gettyimages-950606828.jpg?h=93e29675&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-11/gettyimages-687477320.jpg?h=6b7011a3&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/rosie_o_donnell_gettyimages-950606828.jpg?h=93e29675", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/rosie-odonnell-says-her-relationship-with-estranged-daughter-chelsea-is-much-better-now-110628", "title": "Rosie O'Donnell Says Her Relationship With Estranged Daughter Chelsea Is Much Better Now", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/rosie_o_donnell_gettyimages-950606828.jpg?h=93e29675", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The actress opened up about their 'troubled times' on Friday's episode of 'The Talk.'", "title": "Rosie O'Donnell on Her Relationship With Estranged Daughter Chelsea", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/rosie-odonnell-says-her-relationship-with-estranged-daughter-chelsea-is-much-better-now-110628", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The actress opened up about their 'troubled times' on Friday's episode of 'The Talk.'", "twitter": {"description": "The actress opened up about their 'troubled times' on Friday's episode of 'The Talk.'", "title": "Rosie O'Donnell on Her Relationship With Estranged Daughter Chelsea", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/rosie-odonnell-says-her-relationship-with-estranged-daughter-chelsea-is-much-better-now-110628", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-06/rosie_o_donnell_gettyimages-950606828.jpg?h=93e29675", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Rosie O'Donnell Says Her Relationship With Estranged Daughter Chelsea Is Much Better Now | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Rosie O Donnell", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
