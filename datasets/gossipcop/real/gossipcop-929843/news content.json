Maroon 5 frontman Adam Levine and country crooner Blake Shelton have been with the show from the start while current coaches Jennifer Hudson and Kelly Clarkson had each done a season before the current one. Is one of this foursome your favorite ever coach? Or do you prefer one of the other eight singers who have left the panel? Vote in our poll below and sound off in the comments section.\n\nHudson was first a coach last fall on season 13 of this Emmy-winning show. She proved to be unlucky in her debut, just missing out on a place in the final when Noah Mac was the last of the Top 8 to be eliminated. That season marked the sixth win for Shelton. One of his artists, Chloe Kohanksi, won the title while another, Red Marlowe, made it to fourth place. Levine was denied his fourth win after Addison Agen had to settle for runner-up status. The fourth coach in season 13 was Miley Cyrus, who had started out with both Kohanski and Agen on her team.\n\nClarkson, who was an advisor on Season 13, was a coach for the first time this spring. The first winner of \"American Idol\" used her experience on that reality competition series to mentor Brynn Cartelli to the win. She has strong opinions and held her own then against both Shelton and Levine. She connected with the other woman on the panel, Alicia Keys, who was back in the chair for a third stint, coming off a win in spring 2017.\n\nSEE \u2018The Voice\u2019 Winners Full List: Photos and Where Are They Now Updates\n\nIs one of these your favorite coach of all-time? Or do you prefer one of the other original coaches - Christina Aguilera -- who had to wait till season 11 before her first and only (to date) win? Other one-time winning coaches were Usher (season 6) and Pharrell Williams (season 8). And don't forget these three other coaches who may never have had the winning contestant but still made the show must see TV: Cee Lo Green, Shakira and Gwen Stefani.\n\nWe will start offering a predictions event for \"The Voice\" when live shows begin in a few weeks.
