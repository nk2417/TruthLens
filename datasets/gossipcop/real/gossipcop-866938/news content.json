But with the secrecy surrounding the family drama, we know very little about what actually goes down when we say goodbye to the Pearson clan.\n\nFortunately, Chrissy Metz \u2014 who plays Kate Pearson \u2014 stopped by the \u201cTonight Show\u201d Monday to give Jimmy Fallon just a teeny, tiny bit more about the ultra secret series finale scenes.\n\n\u201cSo, they\u2019ve done, they\u2019ve banked a couple of scenes for the series finale,\u201d Metz told Fallon, when he pulled at that particular thread. \u201cI know.\u201d\n\nWhen Fallon suggested Metz must have had fun filming some of those final pieces of the puzzle, she replied, coyly: \u201cWho knows if I was in them.\u201d\n\nAh, rats, Jimmy. You can\u2019t trick Chrissy into revealing things that easily.\n\n\u201cYeah. But I\u2019m not going to tell you who were in the scenes,\u201d Metz continued. \u201cI mean I might have been around the set. I don\u2019t know if I was actually in the scenes though. Mhm-mhm. Do with that what you will.\u201d\n\nWhen asked for some spoilers for the current season, Metz told Fallon, \u201cI would say, I can\u2019t tell you anything. But, uh, we know that, you know, Kate is gonna be having a babe. I know that there is going to be some joy for both Kate and [her husband Toby, played by Chris Sullivan]. And when there is joy, there\u2019s also pain. \u2018Cause a la, \u2018This Is Us.\u2019 But there\u2019ll be joy.\u201d\n\nWatch a clip from the interview above.\n\n\u201cThis Is Us\u201d airs Tuesdays at 9/8c on NBC", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?fit=53%2C58&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325_COVER-_IR_5x4.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Chrissy-Metz-This-Is-Us.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Chrissy-Metz-This-Is-Us.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Maas", "Tv Reporter", "Jennifer.Maas Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/chrissy-metz-this-is-us-series-finale-scenes-filmed-kate/", "title": "Chrissy Metz Says Scenes Are \u2018Banked\u2019 for \u2018This Is Us\u2019 Series Finale \u2013 But Won\u2019t Tell You Who\u2019s in Them (Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chrissy Metz Says Scenes Are 'Banked' for 'This Is Us' Series Finale - But Won't Tell You Who's in Them (Video)", "description": "\"Do with that what you will,\" NBC star says", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/chrissy-metz-this-is-us-series-finale-scenes-filmed-kate/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Chrissy-Metz-This-Is-Us.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/png"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2018-10-30T14:51:09+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-10-30T15:13:34+00:00"}, "author": "Jennifer Maas", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Jennifer Maas", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "chrissy-metz, dan_fogelman, nbc, this-is-us", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "dailies, tv, videos", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1540911069.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
