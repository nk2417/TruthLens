Your body is not a weapon.\n\n\n\nFinally, it\u2019s the entire premise of this show that makes it so unbelievably wrong. \u201cWho do you want to get revenge on?\u201d Khloe asks her subjects. Stephanie wants to get back at her mean friends, and Will wants to get back at his boyfriend. But neither of these situations really calls for vengeance so much as leaving behind the people that hurt you and moving on with your life. I understand that Moving On With Your Life Body isn\u2019t quite so catchy a title, but your body is not an instrument of vengeance.\n\n\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s why Will and Stephanie\u2019s respective stories end with such anti-climaxes that I found myself kind of embarrassed for both of them. In the grand tradition of weight-loss shows, Revenge Body concludes with a \u201cbig reveal.\u201d Stephanie throws a pool party and shows up in a two-piece bathing suit. There, she intends to confront her meanest friend, and, uh, just really get back at her by, you know, being in a bikini. The big showdown, of course, is just an awkward talk between women who don\u2019t really like each other. It\u2019s the same talk we\u2019ve all had when running into someone we\u2019re not really friends with anymore at a cocktail party. Except in swimsuits.\n\n\n\nWill\u2019s throws a cocktail party, hoping that Kyle will show up and, I guess, just burst into tears or propose. As ever, the revenge plan is a lot more exciting than the actual execution. I mean, this is a reality show, but Will\u2019s relationship was real. Would you actually want your recent ex-boyfriend to turn up at the fake party you threw just for him, and then have the entire thing broadcast on E!? I\u2019m fairly certain that if Kyle had actually shown up, then Will would have been the one to burst into tears. I\u2019m telling you, people: THERAPY.\n\n\n\nThis is the only redeeming quality Revenge Body has going for it, and it\u2019s entirely unintentional. This show underscores just how un-life-changing weight-loss really is. Neither Will nor Stephanie are transformed by working out and eating foods that \u201chad a life.\u201d They seem fine at the end, but they were fine to begin with. They were just going through totally ordinary, crummy phases of life: hurt, heartbreak, and insecurity. There is no escaping these things, and there\u2019s no one to blame them on. Not even Kyle.", "images": ["https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d68e2ddc49f6065953daf57eac5b849a.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/b3658fb2d9482c50df8996241fb2b67d.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/9aa89696be7da8b249e2ee2622a111e9.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/1ce585852b9e9a8cba36762b911e0f5f.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/cda4774d79df76d9c5ab2dfba3784155.png", "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/fc2/1,0,3810,2000/x,80/1724194/image.jpg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/90e3b0501ff143bd058ecb3f754a4430.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/c5a8ae3dd50e6ebe17044593c2c7ee0c.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/6a9d712b4b1480df334054a94146cc34.png"], "top_img": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/fc2/1,0,3810,2000/x,80/1724194/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tanyel Mustafa", "Chloe Laws", "Taren Holliman", "L'Or\u00e9al Blackett", "Carly Lewis-Oduntan", "Lucia Osborne-Cro...", "Erika W.
