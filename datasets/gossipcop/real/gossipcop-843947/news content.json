Cooper was so committed to the project that he logged hundreds of hours learning to play the guitar and sing well enough to perform at Coachella and Glastonbury without being booed offstage. He analyzed his dreams, re-purposing certain images and ideas for art. He used his own pain and addiction\u2014which he has been reluctant to discuss in interviews\u2014to anchor his heart-aching role as an addict who, in spite of his artistic talent, is broken inside. He spent hours interviewing Lady Gaga with his co-writer Eric Roth to ensure that her character, Ally, was authentic to Gaga\u2019s own struggles. He filled his cast with people who meant something special to him\u2014including his own ear doctor! He incorporated subtle, sweet homages to previous versions of Hollywood\u2019s favorite love story. As Taffy Brodesser-Akner wrote for The New York Times, \u201cEvery detail of [the film] comes from a true thing\u2014something he\u2019s learned, something he\u2019s seen, something he knows for sure.\u201d\n\nAs a public service to better understand Cooper and his magnum opus, we compiled some of the Easter eggs, homages, and Bradley-isms that the star-slash-director lovingly planted in his version of A Star Is Born. To paraphrase the \u201cShallow\u201d lyrics belted out by Cooper\u2019s Jackson and Gaga\u2019s Ally at a stadium mic: we\u2019re off the deep end; watch as we dive in.\n\nA Judy Garland Homage\n\nGarland\u2019s starring role in 1954\u2019s A Star Is Born earned her an Oscar nomination. And in the early moments of Cooper\u2019s remake, Lady Gaga pays subtle tribute to her predecessor by humming \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d It is during this riff that the movie\u2019s title appears in klieg lights\u2014an aesthetic nod to the remakes before it.", "images":
