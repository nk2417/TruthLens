{"url": "https://people.com/music/jennifer-hudson-accuses-david-otunga-aggressive-behavior/", "text": "In her request for a protective order, Jennifer Hudson accuses her ex-fianc\u00e9 David Otunga of ongoing harassing and threatening behavior and claims he once pushed her inside their home.\n\n\u201cI am now living in fear of further action David might take,\u201d the American Idol alum, 36, says in the order of protection, obtained by TMZ. Otunga has denied any claims of abuse or harassment via his lawyer, who told PEOPLE he plans to file for primary custody.\n\nIn a specific instance, Hudson claims Otunga, 37, called her repeatedly while she was at a recording session; when she didn\u2019t pick up his calls, the star claims her ex then asked their 8-year-old son David Otunga Jr. to record the scene, reports the site.\n\nJason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nHudson also reportedly claims in the legal docs Otunga believes she is dating one of her producers, but she denies she is involved with anyone new.\n\nAfter she arrived home that day, Hudson says Otunga was \u201cvisibly\u201d angry and grabbed their son by the hand and pushed Hudson out of their master bedroom. The Oscar winner claims David Jr., a makeup artist and an assistant were all present during the incident.\n\nThe Voice coach also says the retired wrestler occasionally left a gun and holster \u2014 which he said was a movie prop \u2014 on their kitchen counter to intimidate her. \u201cI believe that he left it out to taunt, intimidate and frighten me, which he absolutely accomplished,\u201d she reportedly claims in the papers.\n\nKevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nAbout a month after becoming engaged in Sept. 2008, Hudson\u2019s mother, Darnell Donerson, and her brother Jason Hudson were found fatally shot in a Chicago home. Her 7-year-old nephew Julian King was found dead in the backseat of a car. Hudson\u2019s former brother-in-law William Balfour was convicted of the murders in 2012.\n\nPEOPLE confirmed exclusively Thursday night Otunga and Hudson have ended their relationship after 10 years together. \u201cJennifer\u2019s actions are solely taken in the best interest of their son,\u201d her rep said in a statement regarding Hudson\u2019s request for a protective order, which gives Hudson possession of their residence and orders him to stay away from her and their son.\n\nOtunga\u2019s attorney Tracy M. Rizzo told PEOPLE in a statement her client \u201cnever abused or harassed Ms. Hudson or their son\u201d and that he \u201clooks forward to his day in court and in being awarded the residential care of the parties\u2019 only child.\u201d", "images":
