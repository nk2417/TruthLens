It might be of interest to take a look at the \u201960 Minute\u2019 interview from 1992 and see what you think,\u201d she tweeted, linking to the interview with Steve Kroft in which Allen discussed the allegations waged against him by his adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow. Farrow has accused Allen of sexually assaulting her in 1992 when she was seven years old, though he has never been charged. Keaton has starred in a number of Allen\u2019s films, including \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d \u201cInteriors,\u201d and \u201cManhattan.\u201d\n\nWoody Allen is my friend and I continue to believe him.

Many stars, including Colin Firth and Greta Gerwig, recently said they would not work with the director again. Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Rebecca Hall have pledged to donate their salaries from Allen\u2019s upcoming film \u201cA Rainy Day in New York\u201d to various charities, including the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nAlec Baldwin has also advocated for Allen, saying it\u2019s \u201cunfair and sad\u201d that actors are denouncing the filmmaker. Kate Winslet, who as recently as December sang Allen\u2019s praises, said at the London Film Critics\u2019 Circle Awards on Sunday that she has \u201cbitter regrets\u201d from working with \u201cmen of power\u201d who are associated with sexual harassment and assault.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rexfeatures_8861050cy.jpg?w=1000&h=667&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rexfeatures_8861050cy.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rexfeatures_8861050cy.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matt Fernandez", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/diane-keaton-defends-woody-allen-sexual-abuse-1202680654/", "title": "Diane Keaton Defends Woody Allen: \u2018I Continue to Believe Him\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "As stars abandon director Woody Allen, Diane Keaton came to his defense, saying she will \"continue to believe him.\"", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Matt Fernandez", "tags": "Diane Keaton, Dylan Farrow, Woody Allen", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Diane Keaton Defends Woody Allen: \u2018I Continue to Believe Him\u2019", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/film/news/diane-keaton-defends-woody-allen-sexual-abuse-1202680654/", "description": "As stars abandon director Woody Allen, Diane Keaton came to his defense, saying she will \"continue to believe him.\"", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rexfeatures_8861050cy.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Woody Allen and Diane Keaton"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-29T22:47:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-29T22:47:45+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "As stars abandon director Woody Allen, Diane Keaton came to his defense, saying she will \"continue to believe him.\"", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@matt_fern", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Diane Keaton Defends Woody Allen: \u2018I Continue to Believe Him\u2019", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rexfeatures_8861050cy.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517266065.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
