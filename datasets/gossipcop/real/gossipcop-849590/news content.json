Nicole Kidman proves she can clap normally after THAT seal-like Oscar mishap had the internet in hysterics\n\nNICOLE Kidman proved she really can clap normally \u2013 after being mercilessly ridiculed for being caught applauding like a seal at the 2017 Oscars.\n\nThe Academy Award winning 49-year-old was embarrassed once again on Monday when Ellen DeGeneres dragged up the unfortunate moment on her daytime talk show.\n\nNicole was on Ellen\u2019s couch as a star guest \u2013 but being an A-Lister didn\u2019t save her from being grilled over the weird moment that stunned the world earlier in the year.\n\nThrough blushes, Nicole explained exactly why she had been clapping strangely in the first place \u2013 although it took her a while to reach that point.\n\n\u201cLion was up for an Academy Award \u2013 a great, great film, beautiful film. And you got a lot of attention for the way you were clapping,\u201d Ellen said \u2013 ambushing Nicole with video of the moment.\n\nA clearly mortified Ms Kidman threw her hands over her head and exclaimed: \u201cEllen!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m just\u2026 did you know ahead of time that you clapped in a different way?\u201d Ellen then asked.\n\nDenying she claps the way she was caught on camera, Nicole pleaded: \u201cI don\u2019t clap like that! I do not clap like that! That is a weird lens.\u201d\n\nEllen called her bluff, however, replying: \u201cThe lens didn\u2019t do it to anybody else\u2019s fingers. How can you make any noise like that? You\u2019re not even really clapping.\u201d\n\nNicole then launched into her well rehearsed excuse \u2013 blaming the fine jewellery as the true reason she clapped with her hands bent backwards.\n\n\u201cBecause I borrowed \u2013 it\u2019s the Cinderella thing \u2013 you borrow these expensive jewels and I\u2019m like \u2018I must not damage these diamonds!\u2019 Cause I have to give them back at midnight and so I\u2019m clapping!\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cAnd they went back beautifully intact. Not a scratch on them. Keith is like \u2018Do not damage the diamonds!'\u201d she confirmed.\n\nHowever Ellen didn\u2019t appear to buy this response and pushed Nicole further.\n\n\u201cHave you not owned real diamonds before?\u201d she asked \u2013 prompting Nicole to flash the diamonds on her hands.\n\nEllen then demanded: \u201cLets see you clap right now. How do you clap?\u201d\n\nNicole then replied: \u201cI worked on it!\u201d and \u2013 to the sheer unadulterated delight of the live studio audience \u2013 clapped normally.\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict000304922683.jpg?strip=all&w=664", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/et2.png?strip=all&w=844", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DD-19-11-leo-bar-tab_COMP.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/et4.png?strip=all&w=839", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/tp-Adam-Peaty-1911_COMP.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/et1.png?strip=all&w=849", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict000305118311.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/et5.png?strip=all&w=840", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ac-18_11-yaz-hadfield-comp.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/newspress-collage-e5p3y17al-1763580747869.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&1763580752&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tp-composite-nicole-kidman.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/tp-composite-nicole-kidman.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3523089/nicole-kidman-proves-she-can-clap-normally-after-that-seal-like-oscar-mishap-had-the-internet-in-hysterics/", "title": "Nicole Kidman proves she can clap normally after THAT seal-like Oscar mishap had the internet in hysterics", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
