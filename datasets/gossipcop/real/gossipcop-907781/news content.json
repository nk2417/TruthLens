And while the actor didn\u2019t elaborate on who he was talking about at the time, backstage he let reporters in on a little secret \u2014 it was Lily Tomlin!\n\n\u201cYeah. That was Lily Tomlin,\u201d he explained at the 2018 SAG Awards press room at The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on Sunday. \u201cShe\u2019s a wonder in herself and I\u2019ve always loved her. I see her, I say hello.\u201d\n\nTomlin was also the recipient of the SAG life achievement award at least year\u2019s ceremony.\n\nBe sure to check out PEOPLE\u2019s full SAG Awards coverage to get the latest news on Hollywood\u2019s big night.\n\nShortly after walking onstage to begin his speech earlier that night, Freeman stopped and said, \u201cHey\u2026I\u2019m talking to you. Yeah, hey,\u201d to a then-unidentified person in the audience.\n\n\u201cOkay, well you just stand out to me, that\u2019s all,\u201d he added, before resuming his speech.\n\nFreeman received the life achievement award at the ceremony this year for his work in film, in addition to his humanitarian accomplishments. His Electric Company costar Rita Moreno, who is an EGOT winner, presented him the honor, which Freeman presented to her back in 2013.\n\n\u201cMorgan is more than just an actor, producer humanitarian \u2014 this man is a national treasure,\u201d Moreno, 86, said before the video montage dedicated to Freeman\u2019s career.\n\nKevork Djansezian/Getty\n\nBefore taking the stage, Freeman was greeted with a standing ovation from the audience \u2014 and the cheers intensified, even more, when he headed to accept the honor.\n\n\u201cMorgan, lift up your hat,\u201d instructed Moreno, who wanted to make sure the audience was able to see his face.\n\n\u201cYou have no idea how long I\u2019ve had to put with that,\u201d Freeman joked before starting his speech.\n\nTo donate to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which will provide subsidized legal support to women and men in all industries who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace, visit its GoFundMe page. Learn more about Time\u2019s Up, an organization of women in entertainment combating sexual harassment and inequality, on its website.\n\n\u201cThis is beyond an honor. This is a place in history,\u201d he said, before adding, \u201cOh, and one more thing, I wasn\u2019t going to do this. I\u2019m going to tell you what\u2019s wrong with this statue, it works from the back, from the front it\u2019s gender specific. Maybe I started something.\u201d\n\nAfter winning a statewide drama competition in Mississippi at age 12, Freeman went on to perform in small parts before serving in the U.S. Air Force, eventually graduating to film and television roles in his subsequent career in Hollywood, which has resulted in over $4.5 billion in cumulative worldwide ticket sales.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kristen Bell Talks Husband Dax Shepard\u2019s \u201cUnending Support\u201d For SAG Hosting Duties\n\nIn addition to his work on screens big and small \u2014 namely in movies like Unforgiven, Million Dollar Baby, The Shawshank Redemption, Driving Miss Daisy, and Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight trilogy \u2014 Freeman has embarked on several philanthropic ventures. In 1973, he co-founded the Frank Silvera Writers\u2019 Workshop in support of black playwrights, and he continues to contribute to Artists for a New South Africa and the Campaign for Female Education.\n\nThe prestigious award has been given to esteemed members of the industry elite in the recent past, including Ernest Borgnine in 2010, Mary Tyler Moore in 2011, Dick Van Dyke in 2012, Moreno in 2013, Debbie Reynolds in 2014, and Carol Burnett in 2015. Lily Tomlin received the honor at last year\u2019s ceremony.\n\nThe 24th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards was broadcast live from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on both TNT and TBS.", "images":
