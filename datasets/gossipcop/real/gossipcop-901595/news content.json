Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins presented Gadot with the award, who went on to address Time's Up and the current movement of women speaking out with their stories of sexual harassment and called for more women leading films -- and in the director's chair.\n\n\"Throughout my career, I was asked to describe my dream role, and it was clear to me that I wanted to play a strong and independent woman. A real one,\" the Israeli actress shared. \"When I started acting, there were very few female-led movies and even fewer female directors.\"\n\n\"In the past weeks and months, we've been witnessing a movement within our industry and society,\" Gadot continued. \"We will band together to make strides, uniting for equality.\"\n\nGadot follows in the footsteps of Viola Davis, who won the first award at last year's show.\n\nWatch the video below for more of what Gadot has said about the Time's Up initiative.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/1280_gal_gadot_gettyimages-903997948.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1280_ggalgadot_010718.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-01/gettyimages-900948704.jpg?h=6b7011a3&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-01/gettyimages-903998798.jpg?h=77123267&width=256&quality=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/1280_gal_gadot_gettyimages-903997948.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/gal-gadot-wins-seeher-award-critics-choice-2018-calls-more-female-led-films-94146", "title": "Gal Gadot Wins #SeeHer Award at Critics' Choice 2018, Calls for More Female-Led Films", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/1280_gal_gadot_gettyimages-903997948.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "During her acceptance speech, the 'Wonder Woman' star acknowledged the Time's Up movement and called for more female-led films in Hollywood.", "title": "Gal Gadot Wins #SeeHer Award at Critics' Choice 2018, Calls for More Female-Led Films", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/gal-gadot-wins-seeher-award-critics-choice-2018-calls-more-female-led-films-94146", "type": "Article"}, "description": "During her acceptance speech, the 'Wonder Woman' star acknowledged the Time's Up movement and called for more female-led films in Hollywood.", "twitter": {"description": "During her acceptance speech, the 'Wonder Woman' star acknowledged the Time's Up movement and called for more female-led films in Hollywood.", "title": "Gal Gadot Wins #SeeHer Award at Critics' Choice 2018, Calls for More Female-Led Films", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/gal-gadot-wins-seeher-award-critics-choice-2018-calls-more-female-led-films-94146", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/1280_gal_gadot_gettyimages-903997948.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Gal Gadot Wins #SeeHer Award at Critics' Choice 2018, Calls for More Female-Led Films | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, Awards, Movies, TV, Gal Gadot, Critics Choice Awards", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
