Inside it's glowing, we're lucky we're rich,\" Kimmel kicked off the song Tuesday night behind a red grand piano.\n\nFollowing the introduction, Kutcher said he enjoys sipping martinis from a silver cup, Cranston bragged about his shirtless personal masseuse, and Bono and Bell smiled about their \"Bitcoin stock's doin' swell.\"\n\nDJ Khaled didn't do any singing, but he did join in the fun of mocking celebrity privilege by adding, \"Yo check it out. I got new jet skis, major key and a shiny new iPhone 10.\"\n\nThen out of no where, Cranston brought out his trumpet to perform an ear-wrenching solo and when Kimmel asked if he practiced that tune, the actor said, \"No, because I've been too busy fighting AIDS, Jimmy.\"\n\nThe star-studded performance was part of the annual \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" (RED) show, which partners with Bono's organization to raise awareness and money to fight AIDS.", "images": ["https://images.toofab.com/image/b7/2by3/2025/11/17/b7833e2ed24f4cda969a25b404f938b7_xs.jpg",
