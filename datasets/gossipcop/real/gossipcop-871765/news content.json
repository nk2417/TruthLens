I intend to turn this unfortunate incident into a positive life changing event.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again, I sincerely apologize for my actions,\u201d her tweet continued. \u201cI have the greatest respect for police officers and the job they do. My actions alleged in the police report do not reflect my core values and my law abiding character. I am so grateful for the love and support that I am receiving from my family, friends and loyal supporters.\u201d\n\nDe Lesseps was arrested in Palm Beach, Fla., on Christmas Eve on charges of battery on an officer, disorderly intoxication, resisting arrest with violence and two corruption by threat charges, according to the Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nDe Lesseps rose to fame in 2008 on the Bravo show, which recently wrapped up its ninth season. Born in Connecticut, she earned the title of \u201cCountess\u201d when she wed French Count Alexandre de Lesseps in 1993. They divorced in 2009, and she re-married in 2016 to Tom D\u2019Agostino Jr., sacrificing her noble title. De Lesseps announced their divorce in August.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/luann-de-lesseps-140729.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325_COVER-_IR_5x4.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/luann-de-lesseps-140729.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ashley Boucher", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid", "Border-Radius Box-Shadow Rgba", "Rgba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/real-housewives-star-luann-de-lesseps-to-enter-rehab-following-drunken-arrest/", "title": "\u2018Real Housewives\u2019 Star Luann De Lesseps to Enter Rehab Following Drunken Arrest", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Real Housewives' Star Luann De Lesseps to Enter Rehab Following Drunken Arrest", "description": "\"After the events\u00a0last Saturday night in Palm Beach, I am truly embarrassed,\" \"The Countess\" says", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/real-housewives-star-luann-de-lesseps-to-enter-rehab-following-drunken-arrest/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/luann-de-lesseps-140729.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-29T21:45:50+00:00"}, "author": "Ashley Boucher", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Ashley Boucher", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "luann-de-lesseps, real_housewives", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "crime-2, news, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514583950.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
