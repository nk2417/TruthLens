But apparently, they weren't talented or funny enough to deliver the type of Han Solo film Lucasfilm was looking for.\n\nPer the EW piece, Lord and Miller took an experimental approach to Solo: A Star Wars Story. The filmmakers were open to improvisation. Improvisation isn't discouraged in the Star Wars franchise, yet Lord and Miller's approach was allegedly slowing things down. Kathleen Kennedy explains:\n\n\"I think these guys are hilarious, but they come from a background of animation and sketch comedy and when you are making these movies you can do that and there's plenty of room for improvisation, we do that all the time, but it has to be inside of a highly structured process or you can't get the work done and you can't move the armies of people to anticipate and have things ready. So, it literally came down to process. Just getting it done.\"\n\nThis squares with the statement Lord and Miller released after they left the production:\n\n\"Unfortunately, our vision and process weren't aligned with our partners on this project. We normally aren't fans of the phrase 'creative differences' but for once this clich\u00e9 is true. We are really proud of the amazing and world-class work of our cast and crew.\"\n\n\"I think everybody went in with really good intentions and our approach to making the movie was different than theirs,\" Lord said later (via Vulture). \"That was a really big gap to bridge, and it proved to be too big...Sometimes people break up, and it's really sad, and it's really disappointing, but it happens and we learned a lot from our collaborators and we're better filmmakers for it.\"", "images": ["https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/solo-firing/l-intro-1660761824.jpg", "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/solo-firing/lord-and-miller-1660761732.jpg", "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/solo-firing/intro-1660761824.jpg", "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/slashfilm-logo.svg", "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/solo-firing/ron-howard-1660761732.jpg", "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/slashfilm-icon.svg", "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/solo-firing/george-lucas-1660761732.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/solo-firing/l-intro-1660761824.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Evangelista"], "canonical_link": "https://www.slashfilm.com/556206/solo-firing/", "title": "'Solo' Firing Explained: Why Lucasfilm Replaced Lord And Miller With Ron Howard", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "thumbnail": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/solo-firing/l-intro-1660761824.jpg", "description": "Details have emerged about the Solo firing.
