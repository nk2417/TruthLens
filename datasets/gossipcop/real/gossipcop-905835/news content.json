The award was handed out during the online-only telecast of the Critics' Choice Awards, which aired before the CW broadcast the two final hours of the program.\n\nFranco has become increasingly embroiled in a sexual misconduct scandal following his appearance at the Golden Globe Awards on Sunday.\n\nAt the Globes, Franco won for best actor and wore a Time's Up pin showing his support for the new initiative, which is devoted to addressing sexual harassment in the workplace and promoting gender equality.\n\nNeed a news break?

So, I don\u2019t want to shut them down in any way. It's, I think, a good thing, and I support it.\"\n\nFranco lost the best actor award, presented during televised portion of the show, to The Darkest Hour star Gary Oldman. The Disaster Artist lost out on best comedy (to The Big Sick).\n\nOrganizers for the program gave no explanation for Franco's absence and said the portion of the show was always intended to be aired in the online portion only.\n\nFranco's representative did not immediately respond to USA TODAY to explain Franco's absence.\n\nFranco lost the best actor award, presented during televised portion of the show, to Darkest Hour star Gary Oldman.
