As he says, he \"got out of it without a scratch.\" However, his assistant, who was driving, broke his thumb. Joe says they're gonna do lunch at home, and \"All is well. Thank God.\"\n\nJoe Jackson's been taken to a hospital after a car accident near the Las Vegas strip ... TMZ has learned.\n\nLaw enforcement sources tell us ... Joe was a passenger in a black Jaguar when it T-boned a red SUV.
