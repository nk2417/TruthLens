Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.\n\nAt such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.\n\nThe Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/28/10/tobias-menzies.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/28/10/tobias-menzies-the-crown-prince-phillip.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/28/10/tobias-menzies.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-crown-season-3-trailer-prince-philip-tobiaz-menzies-netflix-air-date-a8510756.html", "title": "The Crown season 3: First look at Tobias Menzies as Prince Philip", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/tv/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "Showrunner\u00a0Peter Morgan has been recasting roles as the characters get older", "og": {"updated_time": "2018-08-28T09:57:05.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "First look at Tobias Menzies as Prince Philip in The Crown", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-crown-season-3-trailer-prince-philip-tobiaz-menzies-netflix-air-date-a8510756.html", "type": "article", "description": "Showrunner\u00a0Peter Morgan has been recasting roles as the characters get older", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/28/10/tobias-menzies.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/28/10/tobias-menzies.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-08-28T09:57:05.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-08-28T09:57:05.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "TV & Radio", "author_name": "Jacob Stolworthy", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 360, "image_count": 2, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 2, "external_link_count": 3}, "date": "2018-08-28T09:57:05.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176299319"}, "twitter": {"title": "First look at Tobias Menzies as Prince Philip in The Crown", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Showrunner\u00a0Peter Morgan has been recasting roles as the characters get older", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/28/10/tobias-menzies.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"The Crown\",\"The Crown season 3\",\"Tobias Menzies\",\"Olivia Colman\",\"Helena Bonham Carter\",\"Prince Philip\",\"Matt Smith\",\"Netflix\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1535450225.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
