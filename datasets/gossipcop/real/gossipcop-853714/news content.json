In American Crime Story Season 1, one might argue that John Travolta\u2019s expansive take on Robert Shapiro elevated the material from mere docudrama to must-see TV. But who will be the spotlight-stealing figure at the center of Season 2? Why, probably the same man who commanded the most headlines back in August 2005. Yes, Katrina: American Crime Story has found its George W. Bush in Dennis Quaid and there is no doubt the actor is up for the challenge.\n\nEntertainment Weekly reports that Quaid has officially joined the cast that already includes Annette Bening as Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco and Matthew Broderick as FEMA Director Michael D. Brown. We look forward to Quaid\u2019s Bush dropping his nickname for Brown, \u201cBrownie,\u201d just as frequently as David Schwimmer\u2019s Robert Kardashian\u2019s said \u201cJuice.\u201d\n\nQuaid, who, like Bush, is a Texas boy, has spent most of his career playing characters with a natural, Dubya-esque charm. One of his earliest breakout roles, as the smiling, dim-witted Mike in Breaking Away might provide a roadmap to Quaid\u2019s take on the 43rd president. And the actor is no stranger to fictional White Houses; he played President Bill Clinton in the HBO film The Special Relationship and essentially played Bush in the little-seen 2006 singing competition satire American Dreamz.\n\nKatrina: American Crime Story covering the natural disaster that hit New Orleans in 2005 and the government\u2019s highly-criticized attempts to cope with the fallout is slated to air in 2018. (Right in time for mid-term elections.) Though Season 2 is still in the casting phase, production has already begun on Season 3 titled Versace: American Crime Story starring Pen\u00e9lope Cruz. Between two seasons of American Crime Story, another installment of Feud, and still another season of American Horror Story, there may not be a single moment in the 2018 FX schedule that isn\u2019t packing some chapter in Ryan Murphy\u2019s total TV takeover.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58af4c8ba509943785098ff1/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/matthew-broderick%25202.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ec05d4947b345521503868/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/true-crime-tv-series-serial-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691755d7cf2db08d53ca35a0/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ec05d5947b345521503869/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/true-crime-tv-series-the-jinx-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57ec05d4947b345521503867/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/true-crime-tv-series-making-a-murderer-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6914cea29fe6cb3e588f4d02/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fa73de018822eab33ea7c5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690944318b75c927a793b8d6/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69134e1408e5ee77e37d2651/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/591cd0e9f211641b40affb8b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dennis-quaid-dubya.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691505934f93271855d8a78a/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/568d6e392c593fd31392b61e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/american-crime-story-katrina.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/591cd0e9f211641b40affb8b/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/dennis-quaid-dubya.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69178ae76161d5beda0d5421/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5898c1a79d7a7cd341e5b834/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/annette-tout.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e0661d7f7e7718194d67e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6900e3eac5e7673f1832c621/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/591cd0e9f211641b40affb8b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dennis-quaid-dubya.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joanna Robinson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/05/dennis-quaid-george-w-bush-american-crime-story-katrina", "title": "Dennis Quaid to Play George W.
