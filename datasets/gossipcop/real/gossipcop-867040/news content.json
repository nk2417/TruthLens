He thinks he is more important than he really is. The p.a. is the lowest rung on the production ladder.\u201d Another note reads, simply, \u201cjersey jersey jersey.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The crew at the restaurant had to call the cops on November 4 to chase down a guest who skipped out on a $2,000 bill for a 20-person dinner.\n\n\u2022 One particularly pesky guest \u201clikes to vape at the table\u201d and add people to his party. This gentleman is typically late for his reservation and is \u201calways a problem per Michael.\u201d\n\n\u2022 A handful of guests have \u201c86\u201d notes next to their names, to indicate that they are no longer welcome at the restaurant after offenses like tipping $11 on a $200 tab, ripping off part of a couch, and being a \u201chuge F***KING B&^%%H.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Perhaps the best note of the entire thread: \u201cWe accommodated a last minute 12 top NO PRIX FIXE for Will Smith. And she lied, it was a bunch of random people and he did not come AND THEY WERE LATE.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.eater.com/static-assets/headings/most-popular.svg",
