They did not provide any reason.\u201d\n\nThe account continues: \u201cMy son was crying as I put him in the seat. I did not have a chance to try and comfort my son because the officer slammed the door shut as soon as he was in his seat. I was crying, too. I cry even now when I think about that moment \u2014 when the border officers took my son away.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrities\u2019 Political Affiliations Left, right, or center?
