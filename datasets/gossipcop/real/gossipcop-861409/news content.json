It was released on 15 June 2017 through Columbia Records as the fourth single from his fifth studio album, Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1 (2017). Starrah assisted the artists in writing the song.[1][2]\n\n\"Feels\" peaked at number one in Belgium, Iceland, Israel, Latvia, Lebanon, Poland, and the United Kingdom. Elsewhere, it charted within the top ten in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Panama, Paraguay, Portugal, Slovakia, Serbia, Slovenia and Switzerland as well as the top 20 in Italy, Sweden and the United States. Emil Nava directed two music videos for the song, which respectively premiered in June and August 2017.\n\nBackground and release [ edit ]\n\nDuring 2011, Harris was planned to open for Katy Perry in the latter's California Dreams Tour. When he cancelled his appearance on the tour, it caused a disagreement between the two. According to her, they eventually \"bumped into each other\" during a Vanity Fair Oscar party. Harris then said that he had a song Perry should \"check out\". She later agreed and collaborated in the song.[3][4] Other than Perry, Pharrell Williams and Big Sean collaborated in the song.[5] Starrah helped write the song;[3] the song was produced by Harris himself.[6] Harris announced his fifth album, titled Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1 on 9 May 2017.[7] On 14 June, Harris revealed that he would release the fourth single from the album, titled \"Feels\". The post included the single's cover art and credits.[8] The song was released on 15 June, before the album's release date on 30 June.[9]\n\nComposition [ edit ]\n\n\"Feels\" is a disco-funk[10] and ska[11] song containing elements of dancehall, hip-hop and electronica.[12] The bassline and chord progression of the song bear resemblance to \"Let's Groove\" (1981) by Earth, Wind & Fire; its authors, Maurice White and Wayne Vaughn, were later acknowledged in the song's credits.[13]\n\nCritical reception [ edit ]\n\nAndy Cush of Spin called the song \"a little flimsy\" while also noting that \"the groove is unimpeachable\" and that \"It has a skillful melange of sounds from the mid-70s apex of analog recording, the era of disco and yacht rock: a warm and rounded bassline, some Nile Rodgers-style guitar, a slick descending line on Fender Rhodes.\"[14] Rolling Stone's Elia Leight said that the song is \"a simple, lighthearted loop, which combines punctual ska guitar, a playful keyboard line and charming squeaks that recall a cartoon character's slip on a banana peel.\"[15] Brent Faulkner from The Musical Hype said the song is undercooked, leaving more to be desired, adding that it's \"the type of record that is pleasing more because of the sound than the lyricism.\"[16] Erin Van Der Meer from Grazia said the song was so \"right this minute\" that it \"almost feels forced.\"[17]\n\nKrystal Rodriguez of Vice reported that the song was \"primed for summertime play\" and \"yet another contender for song of the summer.\" Rodriguez further said that the song had a \"laidback beat\" perfect for pool parties and sitting beneath the sun.[18] Saeed Saeed of The National said that \"Feels\" was the highlight of the album, further stating that it had Pharrell Williams' strongest vocal performance since \"Blurred Lines\".[19]\n\nCommercial performance [ edit ]\n\nIn the US, \"Feels\" debuted at number 50 on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached a peak of 20, making it Harris' eighth top 20 hit, as well as Perry's eighteenth. It spent eighteen weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. \"Feels\" peaked at number five on the Canadian charts, giving Perry her eighteenth top ten in the country. In Harris' native United Kingdom, \"Feels\" topped the UK Singles Chart, making it Harris' eighth, Williams' fourth, Perry's fifth, and Sean's first chart-topping single on the chart. Across the world, and especially in Europe, the song met a widespread acclaim, reaching the summit in Wallonia, Croatia, Iceland and Israel. It also reached the top ten in Finland, Czech Republic, Austria, The Netherlands, Slovenia and France, among others, top twenty in Sweden, Italy, Colombia and Guatemala, top thirty in Spain and Philippines and top forty in Japan.[20]\n\nMusic videos [ edit ]\n\nThe song's accompanying music video was uploaded to Harris' Vevo channel on YouTube on 26 June 2017. The clip was directed by Emil Nava.[21] In the video, Harris, Williams, Perry and Big Sean lounge around on a desert island in tropical-themed attire. Perry is seen frolicking in the grass, Williams in a boat, and Big Sean in the beachside.[22][23] A second video, also directed by Nava, followed two months later. It features all four artists as a band playing the track in front of a live audience and receiving applause for their performance.[24]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nAwards and nominations [ edit ]\n\nListicles [ edit ]\n\nTrack listings [ edit ]\n\nDigital download [ 39 ] No. Title Length 1. \"Feels\" (featuring Pharrell Williams, Katy Perry & Big Sean) 3:43\n\nPersonnel [ edit ]\n\nCredits adapted from the song's liner notes.[8][39]\n\nCharts [ edit ]\n\nCertifications [ edit ]\n\nRelease history [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/6b/Calvin_Harris_-_Feels_cover_art.png/250px-Calvin_Harris_-_Feels_cover_art.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6b/Calvin_Harris_-_Feels_cover_art.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/20px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6b/Calvin_Harris_-_Feels_cover_art.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feels_(song)", "title": "Feels (song)", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/6b/Calvin_Harris_-_Feels_cover_art.png", "width": 1200, "height": 1200}, "title": "Feels (song) - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
