It was something I wrote a year ago, and somebody didn\u2019t get a job coming to L.A., and they got pissed.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was OK until I saw it on CNN, and that\u2019s when I knew I was in a lot of trouble,\u201d the \u201cFamily Feud\u201d host continued. \u201cThe email was out there \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that big a deal to me. I\u2019m not really a mean-spirited guy at all \u2014 I\u2019m really a congenial guy.\u201d\n\nHe likened his sentiment to when \u201cyou go home every day, and all your kids is in the kitchen waiting on you \u2014 you just need a moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought it was cute \u2014 you all didn\u2019t,\u201d he added to reporters.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111325_COVER-_IR_5x4.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Steve-Harvey-Showtime-at-the-Apollo.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Steve-Harvey-Showtime-at-the-Apollo.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan Gajewski", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid", "Border-Radius Box-Shadow Rgba", "Rgba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/steve-harvey-defends-leaked-staff-memo-cute/", "title": "Steve Harvey on Infamous Closed-Door Memo: \u2018I\u2019m Not Really a Mean-Spirited Guy\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Steve Harvey on Infamous Closed-Door Memo: 'I'm Not Really a Mean-Spirited Guy'", "description": "TCA 2017: \"I was OK until I saw it on CNN, and that's when I knew I was in a lot of trouble,\" the \"Family Feud\" host says", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/steve-harvey-defends-leaked-staff-memo-cute/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Steve-Harvey-Showtime-at-the-Apollo.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-04T00:32:30+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-04T01:49:56+00:00"}, "author": "Ryan Gajewski", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Ryan Gajewski", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "steve_harvey", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "report-tca, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501806750.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
