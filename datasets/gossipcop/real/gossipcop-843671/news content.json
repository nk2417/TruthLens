Shiva isn\u2019t just another reality TV star, though, she\u2019s going to be Bella, Anwar, and Gigi\u2019s step mom.\n\nShiva Safai of Second Wives Club, a 35-year-old model, is engaged to Gigi Hadid\u2019s father. Shiva Safai spoke enthusiastically about Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid to E! News.\n\n\u201cWhatever makes Gigi happy is what we want. As long as she\u2019s happy in a relationship, that\u2019s all we want. So I\u2019m just happy that she\u2019s happy.\u201d\n\nZayn Malik and Gigi Hadid do seem very happy together, after their nearly two-year romance. Shiva Safai has been part of the family\u2019s life for over three years, so Shiva knows Gigi and Zayn Malik quite well. Shiva Safai explains to E! News that Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik have a great relationship.\n\n\u201c[Zayn Malik is] a great guy and she\u2019s a very smart girl and she\u2019s amazing. They have a great relationship.\u201d\n\nShiva Safai of Second Wives Club mentioned that Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik travel a lot with their careers. Bella and Anwar also travel quite a bit but it\u2019s all part of success, so dad and future stepmom Shiva take it in stride.\n\n\u201cThey travel, I don\u2019t even know how they do it, they are all over the world. It\u2019s crazy but you know they\u2019re young and it\u2019s amazing.\u201d\n\nZayn Malik and Gigi Hadid often try to coordinate their travel so that they are in the same city, but it is often impossible to match up schedules. Often too much is made of Gigi Hadid or Zayn Malik being seen out alone because it is almost always due to schedule conflicts. Zayn Malik and Gigi get along well and have adapted to the constant demands on their lives.\n\nSecond Wives Club star Shiva Safai has a great relationship with Mohamed as well, according to her comments. Though there is a 33-year age gap between Shiva Safai and Mohamed, the Second Wives Club star told Fox News she was instantly attracted to Gigi Hadid\u2019s dad, during their first, completely-by-chance meeting in a restaurant. For more on Shiva Safai\u2019s relationship with Gigi Hadid\u2019s father, see this article from the Inquisitr .\n\n\u201cMohamed was there waiting for his friend and it was an instant attraction. I don\u2019t know if it was his piercing blue eyes that attracted me, but I just found him very different and intriguing. We connected on Facebook after that\u2026 He then asked me out on a date and it was just an instant chemistry. Everything felt so right and it was so comfortable. It was so easy\u2026 and I felt that we met each other at the right time in our lives.\u201d\n\nShiva Safai sound excited, not just about the Second Wives Club, but to be a member of the family, and Shiva Safai even had nice things to say about Mohamed\u2019s ex-wife. Shiva Safai had a lot of sweet comments about Gigi\u2019s mother Yolanda Hadid.\n\n\u201cThey have a wonderful mother who always is their backbone and supports them no matter what. And they are good kids with good heads on their shoulders, good upbringing, they have unconditional love, from the entire family and we are all so, so proud of all their achievements.\u201d\n\nYolanda and Mohamed Hadid have three children together, Gigi Hadid, Anwar Hadid, and Bella Hadid. All three youngsters have demanding and successful careers.\n\nZayn Malik often mentions his love and respect for his girlfriend Gigi Hadid, Victoria\u2019s Secret angel, supermodel, and Tommy Girl. Recording artist Zayn Malik has even gotten into the fashion business with his own clothing and shoe line. Bella Hadid, like her older sister Gigi, is a promising young model as well.\n\nRELATED REPORTS FROM THE INQUISITR\n\nZayn Malik And Gigi Hadid: Why Is The Former One Direction Singer So Controversial?
