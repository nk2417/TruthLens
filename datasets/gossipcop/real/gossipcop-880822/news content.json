Trump and heartfelt speeches about serious topics, the 29 year-old stand-up was one of the front-runners when it came to commentary about the show hosted by The Late Show\u2018s Stephen Colbert. Fowler acted as the night\u2019s announcer, adding irreverent quips about the night\u2019s winners and audience members in between segments.\n\nAnd while it was not Fowler\u2019s first appearance on CBS \u2014 he stars on the network\u2019s new series Superior Donuts \u2014 it was likely his biggest exposure to date and plenty of people had a lot to say about the job he did keeping the show moving along and lively:\n\n\u2014 i want Jermaine Fowler to do the voiceover for my life #Emmys \u2014 BuzzFeed (@BuzzFeed) September 18, 2017\n\nWhen I hear @jermaineFOWLER I can\u2019t help but smile. So much enthusiasm. #Emmys \u2014 Joe Dorvil (@JoeDorvil) September 18, 2017\n\nIt wasn\u2019t all positive reviews, though, which is to be expected when an unknown voice appears unabashedly on a traditional platform. Fowler\u2019s flare should not have come as a surprise given how he is on every other platform. His Instagram bio reads simply, \u201cI do what I want.\u201d According to Entertainment Tonight, Fowler told Kevin Frazer that \u201cthey only hired me to be myself. It\u2019s the best job ever. I don\u2019t have to do anything but just talk like this.\u201d\n\nFowler made noise on Sunday night by giving the traditionally staid show a fun makeover, interjecting often silly asides into his voiceover work coming in and out of awards speeches and commericals. Among his best bits:\n\n\u2014 After John Lightgow took home prize for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for his work on The Crown and thanked the British statesman he portrayed in the show, Fowler enthusiastically quipped: \u201cshout out to Winston Churchill!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Celebrating Kate McKinnon\u2019s win for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, Fowler noted that that she is \u201ca mult-talented musician who can play the guitar, cello and piano\u2026 damn!\u201d\n\n\u2014 \u201cThis is Laura Dern\u2019s first Emmy win in six nominations, get it Laura!\u201d he said when Laura Dern won Best Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her work on Big Little Lies.\n\n\u2014 Fowler got especially hyped when Aziz Ansari and Lena Waithe won for Best Writing for a Comedy Series, with Waithe becoming the first black woman to win that award. After sharing that distinction, Fowler yelped simply, \u201cLENA!\u201d\n\n\u2014 When Don King won for Best Directing for a Variety Series Fowler informed us, \u201cDon\u2019s first national directing job was on the Michael Douglas Show. My grandmother loved that show.\u201d\n\n\u2014 He was also psyched for Riz Ahmed\u2019s first Emmy win for Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie, for his role in HBO\u2019s The Night Of. \u201cHe\u2019s also known by his hip-hop alias Riz MC. And I\u2019m also known by my hip-alias: Jermaine Ahmed.\u201d\n\nOutside of Superior Donuts, Fowler has credits in The Eric Andre Show, BoJack Horseman, Family Guy and his own television special from 2015 titled Give Em Hell Kid. Fowler\u2019s foundation is in stand-up comedy, which explains why he was so comfortable in his role on Sunday (Sept. 17) night.\n\nWhen discussing how white CBS has been in the past in a Complex interview earlier this year \u2014 the piece\u2019s title \u201cMeet Jermaine Fowler, the First Black Sitcom Lead on CBS in a Generation\u201d \u2014 Fowler told the outlet, \u201cI feel like they had to shake things up in a way. They did with this show\u2026 Personally, I can\u2019t tell you why CBS chose right now, but I\u2019ll tell you right now the world around us right now is changing, and I feel like they wanted me in a comedy that reflected that.\u201d\n\nThe same reasoning can be applied to why Fowler was tapped to infuse the Emmys.\n\nMore personally, Fowler is romantically tied to makeup artist Meagan Hester, who gave birth to the couple\u2019s first child \u2014 a daughter named Thebe \u2014 in July.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/jermaine-fowler-2017-emmys-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/jermaine-fowler-2017-emmys-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=628&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/jermaine-fowler-2017-emmys-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Armstrong", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/culture/tv-film/2017-emmys-announcer-jermaine-fowler-comedian-7965993/", "title": "Get to Know Jermaine Fowler, the Comedian Who Killed It As the 2017 Emmys Announcer", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "There were plenty of winners at Sunday night's (Sept.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Megan Armstrong", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Get to Know Jermaine Fowler, the Comedian Who Killed It As the 2017 Emmys Announcer", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/culture/tv-film/2017-emmys-announcer-jermaine-fowler-comedian-7965993/", "description": "There were plenty of winners at Sunday night's (Sept. 17) 69th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards, but one of the most-talked about breakout stars hardly got any screen time: comedian and the night's announcer Jermaine Fowler.
