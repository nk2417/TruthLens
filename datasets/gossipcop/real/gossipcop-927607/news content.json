The 25-year-old rapper stepped out in a strapless white jumpsuit that showed off her growing baby bump, with cutouts down the legs.\n\nRocking pigtails and lots of bling, the \"Bodak Yellow\" artist danced, twerked and even pelvic thrusted onstage to the delight of concertgoers. The performance also featured cameos from Chance the Rapper, G-Easy, and Kehlani, who are also featured on Cardi's new album, Invasion of Privacy.\n\nAt one point during her provocative, twerk-filled performance, Cardi joked, \"That\u2019s how I got pregnant.\"\n\nIt's been a big week for the mom to be, whose album debuted at no. 1 on the Billboard 200 charts, making her the fifth female rapper ever to achieve this success.\n\nLater in the evening, Cardi\u2019s fianc\u00e9, Offset, performed with his group, Migos, and while he didn\u2019t bring Cardi on stage as expected, fans noticed that when the trio performed their song, \u201cMotorsport,\u201d they rapped Cardi\u2019s verse but left out Nicki Minaj\u2019s lyric entirely.\n\nThe move was seen as Migos throwing slight shade at Minaj, who has publicly spoken out about her feud with Cardi.\n\nThe 35-year-old rapper claimed she was \u201churt\u201d by Cardi during an appearance on Zane Lowe\u2019s Beats 1 show last week, and noted that due to scheduling conflicts, she was not able to make the music video shoot for the song, leading to some supposed drama between the women.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\u201cI texted [hairstylist Tokyo Stylez], \u2018You know if I don\u2019t show up the day she's shooting, they\u2019re gonna act like it\u2019s because I\u2019m doing it to be mean with the current Nicki hate train,'\u201d she recalled. \u201cThey [Migos and Cardi] all knew that ... and still did interviews and jumped around it just to paint Nicki as the bad person, so you could play the victim. That really, really hurt me because I really, fully supported her.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nMinaj was also spotted at Coachella, partying with Shania Twain, Timothee Chalamet and more.\n\nHere's more on Minaj and Cardi's alleged feud:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-04/1280_nicki_minaj_gettyimages-871046056.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2018-04/cardib_getty950139588.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-04/cardib_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/cardib_main_gettyimages-946712736.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/cardib_main_gettyimages-946712736.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/pregnant-cardi-b-twerks-at-coachella-as-migos-seemingly-throws-shade-at-nicki-minaj-100416", "title": "Pregnant Cardi B Twerks at Coachella as Migos Seemingly Throws Shade at Nicki Minaj", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/cardib_main_gettyimages-946712736.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The rapper and her fiance took the music festival by storm on Sunday night!", "title": "Pregnant Cardi B Twerks at Coachella as Migos Seemingly Throws Shade at Nicki Minaj", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/pregnant-cardi-b-twerks-at-coachella-as-migos-seemingly-throws-shade-at-nicki-minaj-100416", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The rapper and her fiance took the music festival by storm on Sunday night!", "twitter": {"description": "The rapper and her fiance took the music festival by storm on Sunday night!", "title": "Pregnant Cardi B Twerks at Coachella as Migos Seemingly Throws Shade at Nicki Minaj", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/pregnant-cardi-b-twerks-at-coachella-as-migos-seemingly-throws-shade-at-nicki-minaj-100416", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/cardib_main_gettyimages-946712736.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Pregnant Cardi B Twerks at Coachella as Migos Seemingly Throws Shade at Nicki Minaj | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, Music, News, Coachella, Cardi B, Nicki Minaj, Migos", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
