To pay homage to Martha's love for Halloween and her many extravagant costumes over the years, we're sharing some of her most impressive transformations, from the fantastical to the terrifying.\n\nHalloween is our founder's favorite holiday, so it's no surprise that she's the makeover master when it comes to costumes. \"From the time I was a little girl, I have loved dressing up for Halloween,\" Martha said in the October 2018 issue of Martha Stewart Living. \"Every year, I look forward to devising my costume\u2014some years the look is elaborate and the ensemble itself is extraordinarily complex, like when I was Fairy GrandMartha or the Spellbinding Sorceress. For those getups, I worked with the editors, makeup artists, costume designers, and seamstresses to execute some pretty ambitious designs.\"\n\n01 of 18 Queen of Halloween Credit: Photograph by Fadil Berisha; Accessories by Lauren Dumler; Cape by draper Jenny Peet; Hair by Zahir Ziani; Makeup by Daisy Toye; Earrings and necklace by Sabyasachi A costume fit for royalty, Martha graced the 2024 cover of Martha Stewart Halloween dressed as the role we already lovingly know her as\u2014the Queen of Halloween. Largely inspired by coronation photos of Queen Elizabeth I, Martha donned a luxe cape topped with a faux fur capelet. Her scepter was once an old curtain rod and the orb is a plastic ornament that was spray-painted gold and adorned with gems. The crown was purchased from Amazon and elevated to queen status with faux diamond and pearl beads.

Red half-gloves, a bright-blue scarf, and exaggerated makeup added the more cartoonish touches.\" A Behind-the-Scenes Look at Martha's Pop-Tastic Costume\n\n03 of 18 Cover Ghoul Credit: Brian Bowen Smith For one of Martha's spookiest looks, she dressed as a ghoul in 2014. She emerged in a satin cloak, blue contacts, and a streak of dye through her stark white wig. A pop of red eyeshadow added contrast to the icy look.\n\n04 of 18 Fairy GrandMartha Floating into view on a cloud of pink tulle, Fairy GrandMartha holds her glittery wand at the ready. This dramatic ensemble is very easy to construct. The tulle is stitched only at the neck; a bodysuit and leggings provide coverage underneath the gossamer layers. Senior stylist Marco Maranghello from John Barrett pinned Martha's hair into a loose updo and then added in extensions and lots of sparkling accents. For a fantastical look like this, he says, \"The more hair gems, the better.\"\n\n05 of 18 Motha With a flutter of silk-chiffon wings, a dazzling apparition emerges from the shadows to seek her place in the spotlight. Martha graced the cover of the 2011 Halloween special issue as a Motha, the winged wonder. Inspired by a vintage illustration and pieces from Alexander McQueen collections, she paired a cape and faux-fur collar. Thanks to her platinum-blonde bob wig, flirty butterfly lashes, and enigmatic smile, this chic lepidopteran is naturally luminous.

Bedecked in crystals and stars for the cover of The Best of Martha Stewart: Halloween Handbook, Martha radiates spectral sophistication as a spellbinding sorceress. Her ruched gold stole requires some sewing, but is made of easy-to-find materials; her jewelry is made from Christmas ornaments and crafts-store supplies. Martha wears her own gown; scour vintage or thrift stores for something similarly sparkly. Get the Spellbinding Sorceress Costume How-To\n\n07 of 18 Ghostly Equestrienne Martha was instantly transformed into a haunted horsewoman for the cover of the 2009 Halloween issue. This spirited costume is inspired by the fashion of Edwardian England. Martha's grand cape swells behind her as she rides through a twilight gloaming. Her pale eyes stare from beneath red-rimmed lids. Although the cape looks elaborate, it's constructed with just a few folds and seams in a long piece of taffeta. A top hat veiled with black netting is trimmed with gray ribbon and an ostrich feather. Rutger, Martha's midnight steed, wears an ornately plaited mane.

Her dramatic cape is made from black silk woven with metallic threads. Fasten it to a black dress with safety pins, and slip on long satin gloves. Martha's stylist at the time, Eva Scrivo, trimmed a black wig into textured layers, then gave Martha a pale face, dark eye makeup, and\u2014fittingly\u2014blood-red lips. Get the Glampire Costume How-To\n\n09 of 18 Golden Goddess Credit: Craig Cutler Martha was turned into an autumnal goddess for the \"Good Things\" cover of the 2007 Halloween issue, draped in a diaphanous wrap of gauzy silk-organza strips and wearing golden leaves in her hair. For the wrap, you can achieve a similar look with a plain, sheer shawl pinned with the brooch. An urn filled with gold-leafed or painted pomegranates, apples, and leaves helps to set the scene.

Her look, achieved with makeup techniques and prosthetic features, was topped off with a swarm of spiders and a set of menacing black nails.\n\n11 of 18 Queen of the Wild Things For season five of The Martha Stewart Show, which aired in 2009, Martha presided over a Monster Bash as Queen of the Wild Things. Her furry costume was inspired by the beloved Maurice Sendak children's book Where the Wild Things Are.\n\n12 of 18 Medusa Medusa, the Greek monster whose gaze could turn people into stone, was Martha's on-air costume of choice in 2008. An intricate and regal headpiece of snakes crowned her stone-colored costume. The show featured a mausoleum of audience members set in bronze, stone, and marble.

At a \"Hulaween\" gala hosted by Bette Midler, Martha donned a donkey-inspired look with a soft gray hoodie and matching sweatsuit.\n\n15 of 18 Jane of the Jungle For the very first Halloween special on The Martha Stewart Show in 2005, Martha dressed up as Jane of the Jungle. Accompanied by a stuffed chimpanzee, she made a grand entrance by swinging on a vine to start the show. Martha has long been a fan of author Edgar Rice Burroughs's Tarzan series.\n\n16 of 18 Sophisticated Spider-Witch During a costume-creating segment on Martha Stewart Living in 2003, Martha donned a black Halloween spider veil she created using hat veiling, pom-poms, and chenille sticks.\n\n17 of 18 Pirate Sporting a bright-orange bandanna and matching wig, Pirate Martha and her mates took over the Martha Stewart Living set (or rather, ship) in 2003.", "images":
