We are NOT f\u2014ing around here,\u201d she wrote on Thursday. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve got the eye of the tiger. The Fighter dancing through the fire cuz I am a champion and your\u2019re [sic] going to hear me ROAR.\u2019 Thanks to @mrtonyhale& @timothycsimons & @katyperry for their hilarious and loving inspiration.\u201d\n\nThe Emmy winner announced last month that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer, taking to Twitter to share, \u201c1 in 8 women get breast cancer. Today, I\u2019m the one.\u201d\n\nIn the message, the \u201cVeep\u201d actress also called for health care reform to help other women who don\u2019t have the same resources that she does.\n\nLouis-Dreyfus revealed her diagnosis just after winning her 11th Emmy award last month. The award was her sixth in a row for playing Selena Meyers on the HBO comedy \u201cVeep,\u201d setting a new record for the most awards by a performer for a single role.\n\nSee Louis-Dreyfus\u2019 Instagram post below.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BacwfK-DWsR/", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/julia-louis-dreyfus.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5x4_082025_COVER.jpg?fit=240%2C300&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?resize=150%2C150&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?fit=53%2C58&quality=80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/julia-louis-dreyfus.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Film Editor", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/julia-louis-dreyfus-thanks-katy-perry-wraps-2nd-chemo-treatment-for-breast-cancer/", "title": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus Thanks Katy Perry, Wraps 2nd Chemo Treatment for Breast Cancer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus Thanks Katy Perry, Wraps 2nd Chemo Treatment for Breast Cancer", "description": "\"Veep\" actress announced she had been diagnosed with breast cancer last month", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/julia-louis-dreyfus-thanks-katy-perry-wraps-2nd-chemo-treatment-for-breast-cancer/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/julia-louis-dreyfus.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2017-10-20T14:25:41+00:00"}, "author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "julia-louis-dreyfus, katy_perry, selena-meyers, timothy-simons, tony_hale", "article-section": "media", "article-categories": "media, social-media-the-wrap, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508509541.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
