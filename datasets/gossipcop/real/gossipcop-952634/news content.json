We\u2019ll all go on the boat,\u201d said Singer. \u201cWe\u2019ll resolve this, it\u2019s a beautiful boat.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be nice,\u201d stressed Mortimer, having planned the trip.\n\nThe boat did appear to be nice, with glasses of pink champagne waiting for them on the vessel\u2019s table-and-chair set. During the hour-and-a-half ride to the island, the Housewives sunbathed and danced on the bow, laughing and having a good time.\n\nThey were all smiles on the island, too, as they swam in the crystal-clear blue water.\n\nBravo\n\nThings quickly changed, though, around 3:15 p.m. local time \u2014 when they were told by someone associated with the getaway that they had to go back because \u201cthe sea is getting choppy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe coast guard [called] and said it was time to go,\u201d said de Lesseps. \u201cApparently the sea picks up at this bewitching hour of 3 p.m., so suddenly, it\u2019s like, \u2018Let\u2019s get on the boat.\u2019 \u201d\n\nNot all were happy to go. \u201cWe have to leave now. Are you kidding me? No way,\u201d Singer said. \u201cWe want to stay here all day and all night. The water is not any more rough than before. Hello, we\u2019re not in a little rowboat.\u201d\n\nSinger couldn\u2019t have been more wrong, obviously. Because as Frankel put it, they were \u201con the boat from hell.\u201d\n\nAs they journeyed home, the boat was jumping up and down so intensely that Singer was left screaming in Morgan\u2019s arms. \u201cSlow it down!\u201d Singer yelled as the two embraced each other in the boat\u2019s interior. \u201cI can\u2019t swim!\u201d\n\n\u201cI peed my swimsuit,\u201d said Morgan. \u201cI\u2019ve been on many boats in my life. \u2026 This is like being on a airplane with one propeller.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, in the back of the boat, Housewives were ducking table and chairs as they came flying down. De Lesseps jumped for cover on the floor of the boat as Frankel tried to comfort a vomiting Radziwill, who was puking into a bucket.\n\n\u201cThis is crazy. This is really scary. I\u2019m losing my mind,\u201d Frankel said through the course of the trip, as a siren went off and \u201ca 15-foot wave\u201d crashed into the boat. \u201cWhy is there a siren? I\u2019m freaking out. This isn\u2019t funny. Oh my god, get on the floor!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey need to slow down,\u201d said Dorinda, asking where the boat\u2019s life vests were before declaring, \u201cit smells like smoke.\u201d\n\nBravo\n\nHer nose wasn\u2019t wrong. There was smoke \u2014 coming from the boat\u2019s anchor, which had accidentally been deployed and was dragging on the ocean floor.\n\nBefore fans could see more, the show\u2019s cameras went down. \u201cDue to the rough waters, all production crew had to stop filming for the safety of everyone on board,\u201d a title card read.\n\nLater, in safety, the women explained what had happened. \u201cThe boat was trying to reel in [the anchor] and that was causing the smell,\u201d de Lesseps said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got the captain, who runs out of the cabin with two swords, a la Pirates of the Caribbean, and runs to the top of the boat and he cuts off the anchor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad it been on the chain, the boat would have capsized and I wouldn\u2019t have been here to tell the story,\u201d said Singer. \u201cWe would have all been killed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all thought we were going to die at sea,\u201d de Lesseps noted. \u201cIt was so bad, even the cameras had to go down because they were holding on for dear life. I\u2019m just holding myself on the ground, praying that the boat\u2019s not going to capsize.\u201d\n\nAdded Radziwill: \u201cI put myself in some of the most dangerous places in the world [but] being in Afghanistan during the war and the Middle East during that war was nothing compared to what happened on that boat. By the time we got back to the house, all of us just needed to decompress and we were suffering a little bit from post dramatic disorder. Because even though no one got hurt, all of us were just like, \u2018What the f\u2014 just happened.\u2019 \u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: The Real Housewives of New York City Go Makeup-Free\n\nOnly Mortimer appeared to be unfazed by it all.\n\n\u201cThe boat ride was super dramatic for everybody but me,\u201d she confessed, after calling the ride \u201ca little bit bumpy\u201d and \u201ctotally normal\u201d while at sea. \u201cI never feared for my life. But I can\u2019t take away how they felt.\u201d\n\nOne unexpected thing did happen: It bonded all the women, both in their hearts and in the bathroom, where all but Frankel and Mortimer suffered from diarrhea.\n\n\u201cLast night just reminds us why we love each other so much,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe\u2019re out of the boat, and now we\u2019re swimming in s\u2014. And by the way, no offense to Colombia because this could happen in any country. But not like this. Never before like this.\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of New York City airs Wednesdays (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.", "images":
