Other jury members included Judd Apatow, Halle Berry, Jamie Lee Curtis, Leonard Maltin, authors and scholars representing prestigious universities with recognized motion picture arts and TV programs and film and TV critics from media outlets like NPR, Rolling Stone, TV Guide and The Washington Post. Apatow, who is a producer of The Big Sick, recused himself from voting on that film.\n\nTwo years ago, the AFI delayed voting on its year-end list to give critics a chance to see Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which it subsequently included on its list of the 10 best films of 2015. However, this year, the latest Star Wars film, The Last Jedi, which hits theaters on Dec. 15, was nowhere to be found on AFI\u2019s list.\n\nThe honorees will be recognized at a Jan. 5 luncheon in Los Angeles.\n\nThe full list of this year\u2019s honorees follows.\n\nAFI Movies of the Year\n\nThe Big Sick\n\nCall Me by Your Name\n\nDunkirk\n\nThe Florida Project\n\nGet Out\n\nLady Bird\n\nThe Post\n\nThe Shape of Water\n\nThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\n\nWonder Woman\n\nAFI TV Programs of the Year\n\nBig Little Lies\n\nThe Crown\n\nFeud: Bette and Joan\n\nGame of Thrones\n\nThe Good Place\n\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\n\nInsecure\n\nMaster of None\n\nStranger Things 2\n\nThis is Us\n\nAFI Special Award\n\nThe Vietnam War", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wonder_woman_2017_17.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wonder_woman_2017_17.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hilary Lewis", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/afi-names-top-movies-tv-shows-2017-1065499/", "title": "\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 Among AFI\u2019s Top Movies, TV Shows for 2017", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "PBS' 'Vietnam War' series receives a special award.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Hilary Lewis", "tags": "THR Year in Review 2017, Wonder Woman", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 Among AFI\u2019s Top Movies, TV Shows for 2017", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/afi-names-top-movies-tv-shows-2017-1065499/", "description": "PBS' 'Vietnam War' series receives a special award.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wonder_woman_2017_17.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "AFI Names Top Movies, TV Shows for 2017"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-07T13:30:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-15T13:02:54+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "PBS' 'Vietnam War' series receives a special award.", "site": "@thr", "creator": "@hilarylewis", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Wonder Woman\u2019 Among AFI\u2019s Top Movies, TV Shows for 2017", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wonder_woman_2017_17.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512653400.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
