Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, Matt Lauer, Louis C.K., Terry Richardson, and Mario Batali are a few of the familiar faces on the game board.\n\n\u201cDid your person prey on men?\u201d Wood asks. \u201cNot this time,\u201d Tran responds. Wood then proceeds to rule out Spacey.\n\n\u201cThere are so many cases of sexual harassment, that they update a new deck every 10 hours,\u201d Randolph says, joining the game.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe video ends with a public service announcement encouraging support for Rise, a nonprofit organization that aims to defend the civil rights of sexual assault survivors. The PSA was released in tandem with a hearing held on Capitol Hill for the implementation of the Survivors\u2019 Bill of Rights Act. Wood, Rise CEO and founder Amanda Nguyen, and Rise chief of staff Lauren Libby will attend the hearing to testify on behalf of sexual assault survivors nationwide.\n\n\u201cI wanted to participate in Rise\u2019s PSA to help harness the power of the #MeToo movement into concrete action,\u201d Wood said. \u201cIf you are fired up, angry, or feel helpless, join the Rise movement to help protect the rights of sexual assault survivors across the country.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Rise worked toward passing legislation that led to the creation of the Sexual Assault Survivors\u2019 Bill of Rights.\n\n\u201cAs the national conversation continues around the #MeToo movement, we want to give survivors and allies a way to take action to protect the rights of rape survivors everywhere, regardless of geography, race, or economics,\u201d Nguyen said. \u201cWe are thankful for the support of Evan, Kelly, Da\u2019Vine, Tatiana, and the Funny or Die team to build the Rise movement across the country with the goal of passing the Sexual Assault Survivors\u2019 Bill of Rights in every state.\u201d\n\nAn all-female crew, featuring director Veronica Rodriguez, writer Tamara Yajia, and executive producer Kate Lilly, created the PSA.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://source.unsplash.com/random/595x333", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/funny.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/funny.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christi Carras", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/guess-who-metoo-funny-or-die-evan-rachel-wood-kelly-marie-tran-1202711374/", "title": "Evan Rachel Wood, Kelly Marie Tran Play \u2018Guess Who? #MeToo\u2019 for Funny or Die", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Evan Rachel Wood and Kelly Marie Tran play a darker\u00a0version of the classic character guessing game Guess Who? in a new\u00a0Funny or Die video.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Christi Carras", "tags": "#MeToo, Evan Rachel Wood, Funny Or Die, Kelly Marie Tran", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Evan Rachel Wood, Kelly Marie Tran Play \u2018Guess Who? #MeToo\u2019 for Funny or Die", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/guess-who-metoo-funny-or-die-evan-rachel-wood-kelly-marie-tran-1202711374/", "description": "Evan Rachel Wood and Kelly Marie Tran play a darker\u00a0version of the classic character guessing game Guess Who? in a new\u00a0Funny or Die video.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/funny.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Guess Who? #MeToo Funny or Die"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-27T15:48:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-27T16:39:46+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Evan Rachel Wood and Kelly Marie Tran play a darker\u00a0version of the classic character guessing game Guess Who? in a new\u00a0Funny or Die video.", "site": "@variety", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Evan Rachel Wood, Kelly Marie Tran Play \u2018Guess Who? #MeToo\u2019 for Funny or Die", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/funny.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519746521.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
