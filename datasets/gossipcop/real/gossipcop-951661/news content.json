Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT\n\nJessica Biel will not star in The Sinner season 2\n\nCora randomly stabs a man to death on the beach and Detective Harry Ambrose (played by Bill Pullman) takes on her case, trying to figure out why she has done it. The plot of season one was a one ended story, with Cora receiving two years in a psychiatric facility, avoiding a 30-year jail sentence. Therefore, season two sees Detective Harry Ambrose take on a brand new case, involving a double murder in his hometown of Keller, New York. This means Jessica Biel does not appear in the new series of The Sinner. Instead, she continues as Executive Producer on the show. Speaking to Variety, Biel said: \u201cWe did talk a lot about does Cora come back for season two and what is the relationship because that's what was interesting to me. \u201cWhat happens when a woman goes through that? What is life like after that when the only person really in her life that she can connect with, even besides her husband, is the detective who got her out of this thing? But we just couldn't do it this particular season.\u201d WHO IS IN THE NEW CAST OF THE SINNER?\n\nJessica Biel will not star in The Sinner season 2\n\nJessica Biel stars in violent thriller series The Sinner\n\nSUBSCRIBE Invalid email We use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.
