Chip Gaines and wife Joanna Gaines have their hands full with five children after welcoming their youngest son, Crew, in June 2018 \u2014 and they are happy to share their highs and lows with fans.\n\nThe twosome, who wed in 2003, are also parents of Drake, Ella, Duke and Emmie. They grew to fame as the stars of HGTV\u2019s Fixer Upper, which ran for five seasons from 2013 to 2018, but their family has always come first.\n\n\u201cTheir days are busy and hectic with homeschooling, chores and cooking, [but] Jo wouldn\u2019t have it any other way,\u201d a source exclusively told Us Weekly in October 2020. \u201cShe likes being busy and with five kids it\u2019s nonstop activity. Jo\u2019s teaching the kids about gardening and how fun it is to plant the seeds and watch them grow into vegetables. They get to harvest the bounty themselves.\u201d\n\nIn addition to raising their five kids in Waco, Texas, Chip and Joanna work side by side on all of their business ventures \u2014 including the revival of Fixer Upper: Welcome Home as part of their own Magnolia Network, which launched in July 2021.\n\n\u201cNeither of them makes a business decision without consulting the other,\u201d the insider told Us. \u201cThey feed off each other\u2019s creativity and are open to try something new. Their faith keeps them grounded and grateful for the success they\u2019ve found.\u201d\n\nThe twosome run the Magnolia Market, Magnolia Shops, Magnolia Press, Magnolia Seed + Supply, Silos Baking Co. and more at the Silos in their hometown. They\u2019ve also opened Magnolia Table, publish Magnolia Journal and established Magnolia Reality over the years.\n\n\u201cJo\u2019s proud of what she and Chip have been able to accomplish together with basically nothing but a dream,\u201d the source added at the time. \u201cShe\u2019s living her dream life and doing what she loves.\u201d\n\nThroughout all of their personal and professional success, Chip and Joanna have leaned on each other \u2014 and haven\u2019t been afraid to fail. They often share their stories with fans, including advice on parenting, love and their careers.\n\n\u201cChip and his family have always had this thing that Gaines never quit, so he\u2019d say, \u2018Jo, we\u2019re not going to quit, we\u2019re going to make it through this,\u2019\u201d Joanna recalled during a virtual discussion for the Salesforce Presents Stories of Resilience: A Conversation With Chip and Joanna Gaines on Finding Inspiration event in July 2020 of the couple\u2019s choice to push through adversity.\n\nWhen times get tough, the We Are Gardeners author knows that focusing on her bond with Chip will help them get through it.\n\n\u201cWe would look at each other and say do we just bail and get out, that seemed so much easier than having to figure out how do we make it through this,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe leaned on each other\u2019s strengths in those moments of weakness where I would typically only see the glass half-empty and Chip would see the glass half-full.\u201d\n\nScroll down to relive their best quotes through the years:", "images":
