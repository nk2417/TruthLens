Though neither of them can pinpoint what it was that caused a rift, both Pinkett Smith, 46, and Union, 45, say that they felt tension with each other for almost two decades.\n\n\u201cThis is a very special show for me, because what I decided to do was make this about creating a new girlfriend,\u201d Pinkett Smith said to her mom and co-host, Adrienne Banfield-Jones, 64. \u201cGab and I, we had a bit of a break, we don\u2019t know how, and she\u2019s been open to this healing, she\u2019s been open to this conversation.\u201d\n\nJason Merritt/Getty; Paras Griffin/Getty\n\nBefore the show, Pinkett Smith called Union and invited her on the \u201cGirlfriends\u201d episode after not speaking for so long.\n\n\u201cIt felt so good on the phone with you to even just go, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t even take the time to talk to you,\u2019 you know?\u201d Pinkett Smith explained to Union. \u201cAnd then I had to just apologize and just thinking to myself, \u2018Damn, Jada! That was some petty ass s\u2013t!\u2019 But at the same time going, \u2018Well, that\u2019s where you were then. Thank God you\u2019re someplace else now.'\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

The actress later married NBA star Dwyane Wade in 2014.\n\n\u201cI had to hit rock bottom, I had to lose everything,\u201d Union said when Pinkett Smith asked her about the moment everything clicked and she decided to make a change in her life. \u201cFor me that was my first marriage, going through the divorce process. I lost my show, my show was canceled. And I was having difficult relationships with my BFFs, my day ones. And it was everyone\u2019s fault but my own.\u201d\n\nAfter she \u201cliterally found myself under my bed with my dog,\u201d the actress started working with trainer, life coach and actress A.J. Johnson.\n\nGabrielle Union/Instagram\n\nPinkett Smith was the first to address the feud between the two in an April interview with Extra in which she promoted her new Facebook Watch talk show Red Table Talk.\n\n\u201cI have a really touching episode with Gabrielle Union,\u201d Pinkett Smith said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been on the best of terms for 17 years and we have a reconciliation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even know how it started!\u201d she said, adding their feud was \u201cdefinitely\u201d over.\n\nUnion then opened up about the feud during an appearance on the Today show in early May.\n\n\u201cJada nor I ever used the word feud\u2026 Back in the day, neither one of us knew originally what took place back then, but the people that we had around us were like, \u2018Well, you know how she feels about you,\u2019\u201d Union told Hoda Kotb while promoting her new film on Monday.\n\n\u201cAnd then it was like, \u2018Okay, girl, bye\u2019 for 17 years,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd even though we\u2019re both very outspoken women, we\u2019re both activists, our husbands are friends, we both felt we had too much pride and too much insecurities to actually say, \u2018Hey, did that ever happen or was that a creation of someone else who did not want to see two women rise together?\u2019 \u201d", "images":
