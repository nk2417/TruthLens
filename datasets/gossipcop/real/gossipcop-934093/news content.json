Kim and her husband Kanye West have three: North, Saint, and Chicago. Kourtney co-parents Mason, Penelope, and Reign with her ex partner Scott Disick. Rob Kardashian has a daughter, Dream, with his ex Blac Chyna. Kendall's younger sister, Kylie, welcomed her first baby (a daughter named Stormi Webster) with boyfriend Travis Scott in February. And just last month, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian welcomed her first child (also a daughter, named True) with boyfriend Tristan Thompson.\n\nInstagram content\n\nIn a new interview with Elle magazine, Kendall admits that even she can barely keep up with the amount of babies joining the Kardashian-Jenner group. \"[My family is] forever growing,\u201d Jenner said while chatting with Lana Del Rey for the magazine. \u201cEvery time I think it\u2019s eased up, someone\u2019s popping out a baby.\u201d\n\nKendall specifically talked about Kylie's birth during her interview. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously a bit weird that your little sister is having a baby before you,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to happen like this. But it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Not only has Kylie taken to motherhood well, Kendall says it's also made her a more loving sister in general. \u201cIt\u2019s brought us closer together. We\u2019ve always been very close, but we would butt heads all the time. This has made her a bit more loving toward me,\" she said.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/691a2526f98c8f260c27b83f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691ca6075dbfbce9d766d347/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_640%2Cq_80%2Cw_640/v1525899839/glamour_black-panther-s-letitia-wright-shows-us-the-last-thing-on-her-phone.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691632c189abfa806f00d037/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690e460e839f3ecee7a0b476/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af452abf61b107287721a9d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-956246056.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68d8252693dced9f4dc9df51/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68d748296ae85e2583754946/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6903b5c553adbbd18445744c/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68fd26085d7b9103fc8e1a85/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68fbe000939a360acb824909/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/glamour-banner-v2.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/logo-oneNav.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/652c373eb39fab4f49273738/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6913ad6972a856e01633db66/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af452abf61b107287721a9d/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-956246056.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af452abf61b107287721a9d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-956246056.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melissa Minton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/kendall-jenner-thinks-its-weird-kylie-jenner-had-baby-before-her", "title": "Kendall Jenner Thinks It's 'a Bit Weird' That Kylie Had a Baby Before Her", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Melissa Minton", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "In a new interview, Kendall Jenner discusses how she feels about younger sister Kylie Jenner giving birth and how motherhood has changed their relationship.", "id": "5af4533e295117594719a07d", "keywords": "kylie jenner,kendall jenner,stormi webster,noriver", "news_keywords": "kylie jenner,kendall jenner,stormi webster,noriver", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5af4533e295117594719a07d", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In a new interview, Kendall Jenner discusses how she feels about younger sister Kylie Jenner giving birth and how motherhood has changed their relationship.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af452abf61b107287721a9d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-956246056.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af452abf61b107287721a9d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-956246056.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "'I didn\u2019t expect it to happen like this.'", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af452abf61b107287721a9d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-956246056.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Kendall Jenner Thinks It's 'a Bit Weird' That Kylie Had a Baby Before Her", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/kendall-jenner-thinks-its-weird-kylie-jenner-had-baby-before-her"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-05-10T15:09:57.166Z", "modified_time": "2018-05-10T15:09:57.166Z", "author": "Melissa Minton"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "'I didn\u2019t expect it to happen like this.'", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af452abf61b107287721a9d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-956246056.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Kendall Jenner Thinks It's 'a Bit Weird' That Kylie Had a Baby Before Her"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5af452abf61b107287721a9d/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/GettyImages-956246056.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525964997.166, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
