Mind awake, body asleep.\u201d\n\nThe soothing mantra of the hauntingly talented hacker Elliot Alderson (Rami Malek) has likely been ringing in the ears of Mr. Robot fans ever since the Sam Esmail thriller shut down its operations (and very nearly shut down its main character) at the end of season two more than a year ago. Now, \u201cStage Two\u201d of the Dark Army and Mr. Robot\u2019s (Christian Slater) plan is on the cusp of execution, just in time for the launch of season three on Oct. 11.\n\nOf course, those notions are as alien as the techno-jargon found throughout the series for anyone who hasn\u2019t given Mr. Robot much thought in the year since it aired its most recent episode. But considering the incredibly dense nature of the storytelling (the USA Network drama rarely spells anything out for its viewers, and the season three premiere expects fans to remember the events of this complicated tale in great detail), it\u2019s crucial to remember where everything stands as we prepare to return to a world living in the aftermath of the Five/Nine Hack \u2014 at least, a better memory than the one Elliot himself is forced to work with.\n\nFor a truly deep dive into the current standing of Mr. Robot, we invited you to listen to the first episode of our new podcast covering the series, a collaboration with Post Show Recaps hosts Josh Wigler (that\u2019s me!) and Antonio Mazzaro. All season long, we\u2019ll be providing podcast primers on every episode, starting here with an overview of the series and a table-setting for the season ahead:\n\nIn addition to what\u2019s covered in the podcast, read on for some of the fundamentals of what you need to know heading into the new era of Mr. Robot. 1. It\u2019s a Tangled Web Where do we even begin as we attempt to untangle the events of the past two seasons? It\u2019s best to start at the big season one headline: Elliot Alderson, a distressed but incredibly gifted individual, secretly boasts a Hyde to his Jekyll in the form of Mr. Robot, a second personality who takes on the likeness of Elliot\u2019s late father. The two personalities are at war with one another, with Robot intent on overhauling the world through militant revolution, and Elliot intent on preventing himself from causing lasting harm. Through two seasons, the Robot side of Elliot has scored the lion\u2019s share of the victories, all but fully bringing down the global conglomerate E Corp (alternately known in Elliot\u2019s worldview as Evil Corp) through a massive attack known as the Five/Nine Hack, and now on the edge of instituting a second stage of that plan \u2014 appropriately called \u201cStage Two.\u201d There\u2019s a lot more to keep in mind, between Darlene (Carly Chaikin) getting burned and cornered by the dogged Dom DiPierro (Grace Gummer) of the FBI; Angela\u2019s (Portia Doubleday) apparent indoctrination into the mysterious Dark Army; and the boiling feud between two of the most powerful individuals in the world, Phillip Price (Michael Cristofer) and Whiterose (BD Wong). At the heart, however, it\u2019s most critical to understand that the rivalry between the two sides of Elliot has escalated tremendously, thanks to the big season two cliffhanger\u2026 I\u2019m never about withholding things arbitrarily,\u201d Sam Esmail tells THR answering Elliot\u2019s fate before the finale\u2019s conclusion.\u201d] 2. The Key Word When season three begins, there\u2019s one buzz word to keep in mind: \u201cdisintegration.\u201d That\u2019s how Esmail and others involved in the series describe the relationship between Elliot and Mr. Robot this year, or lack thereof. Season two ended with the Mr. Robot side of Elliot\u2019s personality proving his commitment to his cause by inviting a gunshot wound, potentially taking him off the playing field, but at least keeping the operation in motion. Season two also concluded with confirmation that Elliot survived the injury (it\u2019s hard, if not outright impossible to imagine this show existing without Elliot in the hub of it), but the damage is done: Elliot and Robot\u2019s alliance, as much as one ever really existed, has been blown to bits, thanks to a single bullet. Beyond Elliot and Robot\u2019s dynamic, expect other relationships to disintegrate in their own right, whether that\u2019s Elliot and Darlene \u2014 due to her precarious situation with Dom and the FBI \u2014 or Angela and Phillip Price \u2014 due to her potential newfound loyalty with Whiterose \u2014 as just two of many potential examples. 3. America\u2019s Most Wanted Season three stands to bring one of the most important figures in the show\u2019s mythology out of the shadows and back into the light: Tyrell Wellick (Martin Wallstr\u00f6m), once on track to become the youngest Chief Technology Officer in E Corp history until a string of self-sabotaging acts turned him into the most wanted man alive. One of them, at least. Tyrell was an instrumental player in the Five/Nine Hack, teaming up with Elliot \u2014 or Robot, more accurately \u2014 and then disappearing into the ether, almost completely unseen during season two. The season two finale finally brought Tyrell back into the fold, as it was revealed he wasn\u2019t secretly dead, as Robot tried to convince Elliot. But where exactly was Tyrell over the course of the season, and what exactly has he been into in the time since his disappearance from the public eye? We\u2019re bound to find out this year, as Mr. Robot can\u2019t get away with keeping Tyrell in the dark for much longer. Keep an eye out on the inevitable reunion between Tyrell and his wife Joanna (Stephanie Corneliussen), one of the most intimidating character on the show.

The Rose Blooms\n\nAnother power player from Robot lore set for an expanded role this season: BD Wong\u2019s Whiterose. Or is it Minister Zhang? Depends on the day and occasion. The veteran actor plays one of the single most fascinating and powerful characters in the series, as both the head of the Dark Army hacker group as well as China\u2019s Minister of State Security. In her private moments, she seems to prefer the Whiterose moniker, so that\u2019s where we\u2019ll settle as well \u2014 but that\u2019s about the extent of our confidence when it comes the time-obsessed figure, who comes equipped with some of the most destructive potential of anyone on the show.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, every trans character on television creates a dialogue about trans people, which is super valuable,\u201d Wong previously told The Hollywood Reporter about playing Whiterose. \u201cWe need to get people with the program about what trans people even fucking are. Those of us who embrace trans people, like myself, forget that it doesn\u2019t come easily for people. Here is a character that, for all intents and purposes \u2014 there is a poetry of Sam\u2019s utilization of this character as trans \u2014 is rather symbolic. What I mean is that he really wants to discuss in a big way on the show the power dynamics associated with gender. There\u2019s a great challenge in being a powerful woman in a powerful white man\u2019s world.\u201d\n\n5. Cannavale Games\n\nAnd now, a new player enters the arena: Bobby Cannavale, of Vinyl, Boardwalk Empire, Oz, and several other films and shows that aren\u2019t associated with HBO. Given the secrecy surrounding the story of Mr. Robot, it\u2019s not a shock that there\u2019s very little information we currently know about Cannavale\u2019s character \u2014 but as the only new series regular on the board (Wong\u2019s promotion notwithstanding), and given the caliber of actor enlisted for the role, it\u2019s safe to say Cannavale\u2019s presence will loom large throughout season three.\n\nWith that said, here\u2019s what we do know: Cannavale is playing a used car salesman named Irving. Really, that\u2019s the full extent of what we know. We can make some leaps from there \u2014 that perhaps Irving is involved in the mysterious car drama surrounding Tyrell Wellick\u2019s disappearance, for one thing; or that whatever he\u2019s selling, it\u2019s not all that it\u2019s cracked up to be. However he factors into the narrative, Irving stands out as the most intriguing new element in the mix.\n\n6. A Slimmer Robot\n\nSeason two of Mr. Robot clocked in at 12 episodes, many of them equipped with extended runtimes. Between Elliot\u2019s initial incarceration through the first two-thirds of the season, as well as the expanded focus on the greater ensemble, the second year of the award-winning series felt fuller than its first season \u2014 for better or for worse, depending on your outlook.\n\nBut season three aims to bring the series back to basics, at least in terms of how it will unfold: a lean 10 episode order, the same amount of installments as seen in season one. Given the current complexity of the narrative, can Mr. Robot accomplish all of its season three business with only ten episodes? That\u2019s one of the big questions heading into the season \u2014 but it also presents the possibility for a leaner and tighter thrill-ride than anything the show has put forth before, both an exciting and daunting prospect to consider.\n\n7. The Loose Ends\n\nHow will Darlene escape the FBI\u2019s wrath? What are Angela\u2019s true motives? Should we be worried about Trenton and Mobley, the fsociety hackers last seen in Arizona fielding an unexpected visit from the deadly Dark Army agent Leon, played by Joey Badass? Are we really delving into questions of time travel and parallel universes, as Whiterose has seemingly intimated? And what exactly is inside the Washington Township power plant? Really, the list of lingering questions still in the mix for Mr. Robot is vast, but season three stands ready to tie up at least a few of those loose ends \u2014 and at the end of the day, it all comes back to the man (or men) in the title.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve looked back on the second season and I\u2019ve seen a lot of similarities with The Empire Strikes Back, in terms of Luke/Elliot going away and isolating themselves, while their sister is out there and battling the evil empire,\u201d Esmail previously told THR about how he views the road ahead for season three. \u201cI think this is the return of Elliot. Season three, and the way I\u2019ve been thinking about it, is sort of the return to Elliot \u2014 but not the naive Elliot we saw at the beginning of the season. It\u2019s the Elliot we\u2019ve seen go through this horrific experience from the first and second seasons, and with all of that in mind, that\u2019s going to make this new Elliot come into fruition in the next season.\n\nBonus: One Last Listen\n\nStill looking for ways to catch up ahead of season three?
