Last week, I was in the hospital, and I grabbed her and squeezed her hand and said, 'I love you.' I just knew we were in trouble.\"\n\nAs producer Mike DiCenzo later tweeted, that personal story unexpectedly served as the perfect lead-in to Swift's song, which included lyrics that couldn't have been more appropriate for the occasion.\n\nShe sang \"New Year's Day.\" No one had heard it. Suddenly she sings the line, \"Squeeze my hand 3 times in the back of the taxi.\" I nearly gasped. Tears. I think everyone in the audience started sobbing. \u2014 Mike DiCenzo (@mikedicenzo) November 14, 2017\n\n\"No one had heard it,\" DiCenzo explained. \"Suddenly she sings the line, 'Squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi.' I nearly gasped. Tears. I think everyone in the audience started sobbing.\"\n\nAnd not just the audience.\n\nI could see Jimmy silhouetted at his desk dabbing his eyes with a tissue. We all lost it. It was a beautiful coincidence in a beautiful performance. \"Hold on to your memories, they will hold on to you,\" Taylor sang. \u2014 Mike DiCenzo (@mikedicenzo) November 14, 2017\n\n\"I could see Jimmy silhouetted at his desk dabbing his eyes with a tissue,\" he wrote. \"We all lost it. It was a beautiful coincidence in a beautiful performance. 'Hold on to your memories, they will hold on to you,' Taylor sang.\"\n\nAnd when she stopped singing, she stepped away from the piano and straight into Fallon's arms.\n\nThat hug between Jimmy and Taylor after the song was 100% real emotion. Whatever you think of Taylor, she did something beautiful for Jimmy and our show today, and we're forever grateful. \u2014 Mike DiCenzo (@mikedicenzo) November 14, 2017\n\nAccording to DiCenzo \u2014 and, frankly, anyone who watched the moment \u2014 it was \"100% real emotion.\"", "images":
