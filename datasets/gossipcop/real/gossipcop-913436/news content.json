Week 7 on \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d means Becca Kufrin is falling in love with some of her remaining six suitors, with the final four and hometown dates looming.\n\nFor this season\u2019s first international dates, the show headed to the Bahamas, with Garrett Yrigoyen, Colton, Blake, Wills, Jason and Leo still in the running for the final rose.\n\nAfter admitting to host Chris Harrison that she envisions a happily-ever-after with a couple of the men but still has some reservations, Kufrin kicked off the island adventure with a one-on-one date for Colton. The two took to the water to conch dive, spurred on by a local tour guide advising the couple that conch is an aphrodisiac. Of course, there was a double meaning to the date activity, as Colton admitted on camera that he\u2019s a virgin and wanted to tell the Bachelorette about his lifestyle choice this week.\n\nAfter plenty of sexual puns while out on the open seas, Colton\u2019s confession was delayed until dinner, when he revealed that as professional football player, he always put his career before a relationship and hadn\u2019t had sex. Kufrin seemed to (surprisingly) struggle with the news, leaving dinner to get some air outside. After some discussion, she returned to give him the rose, guaranteeing a visit to meet his family. After dodging two bullets this season \u2014 first having previously dated Kufrin\u2019s close friend Tia and now with his lack of sexual history \u2014 it seems nothing can bring Colton down. Onto the final four!\n\nGarrett landed the second one-on-one date of week, while the men back at the hotel, most notably Blake, struggled to stay confident in their relationships with the Bachelorette. Garrett, a consistent frontrunner, faced public backlash earlier in the season after it was revealed he had a history of liking posts on Instagram that mocked Parkland high school students, liberal women, trans people, and undocumented immigrants.\n\nOn their date, Kufrin and Garrett explored the Bahamas by seaplane, eventually stopping to frolic on the beach together. At dinner, the couple dove further into Garrett\u2019s past, discussing his former marriage and his family, and he went on to tell the Bachelorette he was falling in love with her. She gave him the rose, locking in another hometown date spot, and then they proceeded to strip off their nice dinner attire and run into the ocean. Wow, love is such a rush.\n\nBlake, after starting to crack early in the week, got the third one-on-one date, which started off with a concert by the Baha Men. Did we take a time machine back to 2000?\n\nFollowing that hot-ticket musical event (which (un)fortunately did not include \u201cWho Let The Dogs Out\u201d), the two drank champagne on the beach, where Blake admitted his struggles and insecurities over her relationships with other men. At dinner, Blake opened up about his family life and told Kufrin that he\u2019s in love with her, becoming the first suitor to hit that milestone. The Bachelorette gave him the rose, and even said in her solo interview that she was in love with him too and could \u201c100% see him as my husband.\u201d And just like that, we\u2019ve got a new frontrunner!\n\nAfter the trio of one-on-ones, Wills, Leo and Jason ended up on a three-on-one date, competing for the last hometown date rose. With another date on the beach \u2014 Kufrin has a real golden tan at this point \u2014 each man spoke about their families and made a final plea for the fourth spot. After Leo said he wouldn\u2019t be ready to propose in just a few weeks, she sent him home and carried onto the dinner date portion with just Wills and Jason. After much more back-and-forth, Kufrin sent Wills home and gave Jason the fourth rose.\n\nNext week, the final four of Garrett, Colton, Blake and Jason will take the Bachelorette home to meet their respective families, as the race for the final rose really starts to heat up.\n\n\u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d airs on Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screen-shot-2018-07-09-at-5-45_edited.jpg?w=1000&h=667&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screen-shot-2018-07-09-at-5-45_edited.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screen-shot-2018-07-09-at-5-45_edited.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kirsten Chuba", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/recaps/the-bachelorette-recap-becca-kufrin-final-four-1202869106/", "title": "\u2018The Bachelorette\u2019 Recap: Becca Kufrin Selects Final Four Ahead of Hometown Dates", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Week 7 on \"The Bachelorette\" means Becca Kufrin is falling in love with some of her remaining six suitors, with hometown dates looming.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Kirsten Chuba", "tags": "Becca Kufrin, The Bachelor Recap, The Bachelorette", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018The Bachelorette\u2019 Recap: Becca Kufrin Selects Final Four Ahead of Hometown Dates", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/recaps/the-bachelorette-recap-becca-kufrin-final-four-1202869106/", "description": "Week 7 on \"The Bachelorette\" means Becca Kufrin is falling in love with some of her remaining six suitors, with hometown dates looming.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screen-shot-2018-07-09-at-5-45_edited.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "'The Bachelorette' Recap: Becca Kufrin Selects Final Four"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-10T02:32:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-10T16:14:04+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Week 7 on \"The Bachelorette\" means Becca Kufrin is falling in love with some of her remaining six suitors, with hometown dates looming.", "site": "@variety", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018The Bachelorette\u2019 Recap: Becca Kufrin Selects Final Four Ahead of Hometown Dates", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/screen-shot-2018-07-09-at-5-45_edited.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531189953.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
