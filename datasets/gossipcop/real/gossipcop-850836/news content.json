A fourth coach for the season has not yet been set. Jennifer Hudson and Miley Cyrus are already confirmed to be joining regulars Levine and Shelton this fall for the show\u2019s 13th season.\n\nClarkson had been in long-simmering talks about possibly joining \u201cThe Voice\u201d for an upcoming season. She was approached by the show multiple times in the past and had expressed interest, but had been unable to work its production cycle into her schedule.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nBoth Clarkson and Shelton are represented by Narvel Blackstock\u2019s Starstruck Entertainment.\n\nClarkson had been approached in recent weeks to join \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d as judge for its upcoming relaunch on ABC. The deal with \u201cThe Voice\u201d scuttles any possible return to \u201cIdol\u201d for Clarkson, who was the winner of the talent competition\u2019s first season in 2002 and appeared as a guest judge during the show\u2019s 15th and final season on Fox.\n\nWith season 14 of \u201cThe Voice\u201d set to premiere in February, Clarkson will likely be spinning her chair at NBC at the same time that ABC\u2019s \u201cIdol,\u201d expected to debut in March, is getting off the ground. The two shows could even find themselves going head-to-head. ABC has committed to roughly 40 hours of \u201cIdol,\u201d making it highly likely that the show will air two nights a week, as it did on Fox. According to sources, ABC is eyeing Sunday as one of those nights. The end of the spring cycle of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d in mid-March would open up Monday evenings for an hour-long weekly \u201cIdol\u201d results show. There it could face NBC\u2019s regular 8-10 p.m. episode of \u201cThe Voice.\u201d\n\nIn addition to being the first \u201cIdol\u201d champion, Clarkson is also one of its most distinguished alums, having risen to pop-star status on the strength of singles such as \u201cSince U Been Gone.\u201d Clarkson was also a judge on ABC\u2019s short-lived singing competition \u201cDuets.\u201d In addition to manager Blackstock, she is represented by CAA.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited to join \u2018The Voice\u2019 at NBC,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone back and forth about a role as a coach for years, but the timing hasn\u2019t been right until now. I have always loved appearing on the show as an adviser or performer and established an amazing relationship with the network during my Christmas special. I can\u2019t wait to turn my chair and see the faces of up-and-coming artists and provide them with the help and support they\u2019ve needed to break into the industry. Watch out Shelton, I\u2019m comin\u2019 to win!!\u201d\n\n\u201cKelly has been a part of \u2018The Voice\u2019 family for many years as an adviser and performer. We are thrilled she has chosen to join us as a coach to mentor the next generation through our unique vocal boot camp,\u201d said Paul Telegdy, president, alternative and reality group, NBC Entertainment. \u201cEvery time Kelly Clarkson sings you are reminded what an incredible voice really is. We are looking forward to the sound of Kelly Clarkson on \u2018The Voice.\u2019\u201d", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kelly-clarkson.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kelly-clarkson.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Holloway", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/kelly-clarkson-the-voice-1202424125/", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Joins \u2018The Voice\u2019 Season 14 as Coach (EXCLUSIVE)", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Kelly Clarkson will join NBC's \u201cThe Voice\u201d as a coach for season 14, Variety has learned.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Daniel Holloway", "tags": "American Idol, Kelly Clarkson, The Voice", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Joins \u2018The Voice\u2019 Season 14 as Coach (EXCLUSIVE)", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/kelly-clarkson-the-voice-1202424125/", "description": "Kelly Clarkson will join NBC's \u201cThe Voice\u201d as a coach for season 14, Variety has learned.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kelly-clarkson.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Kelly Clarkson"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-11T21:14:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-05-11T23:27:11+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kelly Clarkson will join NBC's \u201cThe Voice\u201d as a coach for season 14, Variety has learned.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@gdanielholloway", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Joins \u2018The Voice\u2019 Season 14 as Coach (EXCLUSIVE)", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kelly-clarkson.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494537253.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
