Of Azalea, the singer said, \u201cShe had a complete disregard for black culture. F\u2014king moron. I watched her career dissolve and it fascinated me.\u201d\n\nIn response, Azalea told Smallzy, \u201cI thought it was a bit of a strange thing to throw that out there, but she\u2019s young and I hope she learns maybe to be a bit less judgmental when she\u2019s kind of in the same shoes. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s getting judged all the time as well by people who don\u2019t really know her. So I think maybe it\u2019d be good for her to try to be a little more empathetic to other people that are in the same situation.\u201d\n\nListen to the full interview here.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/iggy-azalea-sept-2016-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/iggy-azalea-sept-2016-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colin Stutz", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/iggy-azalea-halseys-response-moron-never-met-her-7849211/", "title": "Iggy Azalea Responds to Halsey Calling Her a \u2018Moron\u2019: \u2018I\u2019ve Never Met Her\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "After Halsey recently dissed Iggy Azalea in the press, the Aussie rapper isn't looking to escalate anything things into a beef.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Colin Stutz", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Iggy Azalea Responds to Halsey Calling Her a \u2018Moron\u2019: \u2018I\u2019ve Never Met Her\u2019", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/iggy-azalea-halseys-response-moron-never-met-her-7849211/", "description": "After Halsey recently dissed Iggy Azalea in the press, the Aussie rapper isn't looking to escalate anything things into a beef.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/iggy-azalea-sept-2016-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Iggy Azalea attends the Longines Masters Gala on Sept. 29, 2016 in Long Beach, Calif."}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-27T22:45:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-28T17:01:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "After Halsey recently dissed Iggy Azalea in the press, the Aussie rapper isn't looking to escalate anything things into a beef.", "site": "@billboard", "creator": "@colinstutz", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Iggy Azalea Responds to Halsey Calling Her a \u2018Moron\u2019: \u2018I\u2019ve Never Met Her\u2019", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/iggy-azalea-sept-2016-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498603551.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
