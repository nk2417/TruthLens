The situation de-escalated after the captain recognized Rhames from their sons\u2019 playing sports together and apologized. He said police told him they were responding to a 911 call from a woman who \u201csaid a large black man was breaking into the house.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nVing Rhames filming scenes for \"Mission Impossible 6\" in London.

My problem is ... what if it was my son and he had a video game remote or something, and you thought it was a gun?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Santa Monica Police Department released a public statement about the incident on Saturday. The statement said police received \u201cseveral calls\u201d from neighbors reporting that a \u201cblack male was seen entering a residence and did not live there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs officers were assessing the residence, they encountered the resident at the front door,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cOfficers recognized the resident and the situation was quickly de-escalated with no use of force occurring.\u201d\n\nWhile Rhames said the event happened this year, the press release describes it as occurring in July 2016. The statement adds that after the incident, the department launched a \u201cMeet Your Neighbors\u201d community initiative to encourage neighbors to get to know one another and \u201caddress situations such as these.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis story has been updated with a statement from the Santa Monica Police Department.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/63596f922200002000c2d5be.jpg?ops=100_100", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b5cb06b200000dd02378622.jpeg?cache=TqEdfiD3sW&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b5cb06b200000dd02378622.jpeg?cache=TqEdfiD3sW&ops=1200_630", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/691c87541700009d2b9c5f37.jpg?ops=50_50"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b5cb06b200000dd02378622.jpeg?cache=TqEdfiD3sW&ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Deputy Editor", "Trends", "Whitney Snyder", "Editor-In-Chief Huffpost"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ving-rhames-police-gunpoint-home_n_5b5caf50e4b0b15aba99634c", "title": "Actor Ving Rhames Says Police Held Him At Gunpoint In His Own Home", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "The \"Mission: Impossible\" star said a neighbor had reported a \"large black man\" was breaking in.", "keywords": "mission impossible,911 calls,Mission: Impossible \u2015 Fallout,living while black,Ving Rhames,Black Voices,Entertainment,U.S. News", "fb": {"app_id": 46744042133}, "og": {"title": "Actor Ving Rhames Says Police Held Him At Gunpoint In His Own Home", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b5cb06b200000dd02378622.jpeg?cache=TqEdfiD3sW&ops=1200_630", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b5cb06b200000dd02378622.jpeg?cache=TqEdfiD3sW&ops=1200_630", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/ving-rhames-police-gunpoint-home_n_5b5caf50e4b0b15aba99634c", "site_name": "HuffPost", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The \"Mission: Impossible\" star said a neighbor had reported a \"large black man\" was breaking in."}, "article": {"tag": "mission impossible,911 calls,Mission: Impossible \u2015 Fallout,living while black,Ving Rhames,Black Voices,Entertainment,U.S. News", "section": "Black Voices", "published_time": "2018-07-28T18:23:16Z", "modified_time": "2018-07-28T22:06:09Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@blackvoices", "title": "Actor Ving Rhames Says Police Held Him At Gunpoint In His Own Home", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b5cb06b200000dd02378622.jpeg?cache=TqEdfiD3sW&ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "description": "The \"Mission: Impossible\" star said a neighbor had reported a \"large black man\" was breaking in."}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=us&entryID=us_5b5caf50e4b0b15aba99634c", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "bingbot": "noarchive", "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "97Mj-wW7u8U1NOnkW1rfH-I1kgO0-a9YsgoesOk41R8"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532802196.0, "source": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
