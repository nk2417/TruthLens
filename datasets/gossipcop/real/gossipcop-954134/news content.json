The group consisted of Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson and Zayn Malik (until his departure in 2015). The group sold over 70 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling boy bands of all time, before going on an indefinite hiatus in 2016.\n\nFormed on British singing competition The X Factor in 2010, the group were propelled to global success by social media. One Direction's debut single \"What Makes You Beautiful\" was a commercial and international success, reaching number one on the UK singles chart and being performed by the band at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. They became the first British act to have their debut album top the charts on the Billboard 200 with Up All Night (2011), and subsequently became the first band to have their first four albums debut at number one following the releases of Take Me Home (2012), Midnight Memories (2013), and Four (2014). The band's fifth and final album prior to their hiatus was Made in the A.M. (2015).\n\nConsidered teen idols, One Direction were often subject to fan hysteria comparable to Beatlemania. They embarked on four world tours, two of which were all\u2013stadium. The band's Where We Are Tour, in support of Midnight Memories, was the highest-grossing concert tour of 2014, the highest\u2013grossing tour by a vocal group in history, and the 15th\u2013highest\u2013grossing concert tour of all time, grossing $290 million. They have supported various charities, raising millions for causes like cancer research and autism, and spreading awareness of global issues such as poverty and climate change.\n\nWorth over $1 billion, the band won nearly 200 awards, including seven Brit Awards, four MTV Video Music Awards, six Billboard Music Awards, and seven American Music Awards. As the world's best-selling artist of 2013, the group were named the Global Recording Artist of the Year by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. In 2014, Billboard named the band the Artist of the Year. Forbes ranked them as the fourth highest-earning celebrities in the world in 2015 and subsequently in second in 2016. The band went on an indefinite hiatus in January 2016, allowing all members to pursue solo projects.\n\nHistory\n\n2010\u20132011: The X Factor\n\nOne Direction during The X Factor Live tour in 2011\n\nNiall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles, and Louis Tomlinson auditioned as solo candidates for the 2010 series of the British singing competition The X Factor.[1] They all failed to progress in the \"Boys\" category at the bootcamp stage of the competition, but were instead put together to form a five-piece boy band on 23 July 2010,[2][3]: 227 thus qualifying for the \"Groups\" category.[4] The American singer Nicole Scherzinger, a guest judge, and long-time judge Simon Cowell both claimed to have come up with the idea of forming the band.[1][5] In 2013, Cowell said that it \"took [him] 10 minutes to put them together as a group\".[5] In 2022, The X Factor released previously unseen footage showing that Scherzinger did play a significant role in forming the band.[6][7] The video revealed Horan being chosen as the band's first member, followed by Styles, Tomlinson, Payne, and Malik.[8] Styles came up with the band's name,[9] which has since been commonly abbreviated to 1D.[3]: 226 For their qualifying song at the judges' houses, and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of \"Torn\".[10][11][12] Cowell later commented that their performance convinced him that they \"were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well\".[13] Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were his final act in the competition. The group quickly gained popularity in the UK,[13] becoming a fan favourite on the show with a large online following.[14]\n\nOne Direction were the last contestants eliminated in the competition and finished in third place behind Matt Cardle and Rebecca Ferguson. Immediately after the final, their song \"Forever Young\", which would have been released if they had won The X Factor 2010, was leaked onto the Internet.[15] Shortly afterwards it was confirmed that One Direction had been signed by Cowell to a reported \u00a32 million Syco Records record contract.[16] Recording for their debut album began in January 2011, as they flew to Los Angeles to work with RedOne, a record producer.[17] A book licensed by One Direction, One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story), was published by HarperCollins in February 2011.[18] The same month, the boy band and other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour. During the tour, the group performed for 500,000 people throughout the UK.

It reached number one on the UK Singles Chart after becoming the most pre-ordered Sony Music Entertainment single in history.[25][26] Subsequent singles, \"Gotta Be You\" and \"One Thing\", peaked in the UK Singles Chart top ten.[27][28] In November 2011, One Direction signed a record deal with Columbia Records in North America.[29] Steve Barnett, the co-chairman of Columbia Records, said it was not a difficult decision to sign the band, stating that he \"thought there was a void, and maybe they could seize and hold it.\"[30] That same month, they released Up All Night, their debut studio album, in the UK and Ireland. Critically commended for its appeal to the teenage audience,[31][32] it became the UK's fastest-selling debut album of 2011 and the first debut album by a British band to reach number one on US charts.[33][34][35] In December 2011, they embarked on their first headlining UK concert tour, the Up All Night Tour,[36][37] with tickets selling out in 12 minutes.[38] Critics praised the group's musical performances and popularity whilst on tour,[39][40] and a recording of a concert from the tour, Up All Night: The Live Tour, was released in May 2012.[41] The DVD topped the charts in 25 countries, selling more than 1 million copies by August 2012.[42][43]\n\nUpon One Direction's arrival in the US in February 2012, the group embarked on a radio promotion spree, as well as their first North American concert tour as an opening act for Big Time Rush, opening 16 shows after they had completed the first leg of the Up All Night Tour.[44][45] That month, they announced that an Oceania leg had been added to the tour.[46] They made their first US television appearance on The Today Show, at the Rockefeller Center; an estimated 15,000 fans gathered on the plaza.[47] \"What Makes You Beautiful\" was officially released in the United States that same month, where it debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 28, becoming the highest debut for a British act in more than a decade.[48] By June 2016, it would sell 4.8 million copies in the US,[49] and over 7 million copies worldwide.[50] Up All Night was released internationally in March, and One Direction became the first UK group to have their debut album reach number one in the US, inducted into the Guinness World Records as a result.[51] After the album's international release, it topped the charts in 16 countries.[52] Up All Night had sold over 3 million copies worldwide by August 2012.[42] It was the third best-selling album in the world that year, selling 4.5 million copies.[53]\n\nOne Direction starred in an episode of American sitcom iCarly in April 2012.[54] One Direction's first book to be licensed in America, Dare to Dream: Life as One Direction, was published in the US in May 2012 and topped The New York Times Best Seller list.[55] In June 2012, Nick Gatfield, the chairman and chief executive officer of Sony Music Entertainment UK, said that he expected One Direction to represent a $100 million business empire by 2013.[56] In August 2012, the group's record sales exceeded 8 million singles, 3 million albums, and 1 million DVDs.[42] They performed \"What Makes You Beautiful\" at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in London the same month.[57][58] On 6 September 2012, One Direction won the most awards at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, receiving all three awards for which they were nominated, including Best New Artist.[59]\n\nIn April 2012, an American pop rock band that went by the same name filed a trademark infringement lawsuit.[60][61] According to the lawsuit, the US band had been using the name since 2009, recorded two albums and filed an application to register the trademark name in the US in February 2011. The US band said they were entitled to three times the profits made by the UK band, as well as compensatory damages in excess of US$1 million.[60] The lawsuit claimed that Syco and Sony Music \"chose to ignore the plaintiff's rights and wilfully infringed them\" after they realised in early 2011 that the two bands shared the same name.[60] The BBC reported in September 2012 that the UK group won the legal dispute over the right to keep using their band name, and the US band changed its name to Uncharted Shores.[62] The change of name was announced in a joint statement that also noted both groups were happy with the outcome.[62]\n\n2012\u20132013: Take Me Home\n\nOne Direction on the red carpet at the Logie Awards of 2012 in Melbourne, Australia\n\nIn September 2012, \"Live While We're Young\", the lead single from the group's second album, was released and was a global success.[63] It reached the top ten in almost every country it charted in and recorded the highest one-week opening sales figure for a song by a non-US artist in the US.[64][65] A second single, \"Little Things\", resulted in the band's second number one single in the UK.[66] In November 2012, One Direction released their second studio album, Take Me Home.[67] The album sold 540,000 copies in its first week in the US, debuted atop the Billboard 200, and topped the charts in more than 34 other countries.[68][69] Additionally, Up All Night and Take Me Home were the third and fifth best-selling album of the year respectively in the United States.[70] Upon reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the group became the first boy band in US chart history to record two number-one albums in the same calendar year, alongside becoming the first group since 2008 to record two number-one albums in the same year.[68] One Direction became the first group ever to have their first two albums reach atop the Billboard 200.[71]\n\nTake Me Home was written in groups and has an average of just under five songwriters per track. Savan Kotecha, Rami Yacoub, and Carl Falk, who composed One Direction's hits \"What Makes You Beautiful\" and \"One Thing\", spent six months in Stockholm developing songs for the album, and were able to shape melodies around their tones.[72] One Direction began recording the album in May 2012, in Stockholm at Kinglet Studios.[73][74][75] The album cover artwork features the group surrounding a traditional British K6 red telephone box.[76] Take Me Home garnered generally favourable reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production, although it was criticised for its generic, rushed nature.[77][78][79]\n\nOne Direction performed \"Little Things\" at the 2012 Royal Variety Performance in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, and headlined a sold-out show at New York City's Madison Square Garden on 3 December 2012.[80][81] In February 2013, One Direction released \"One Way or Another (Teenage Kicks)\", a cover version of \"One Way or Another\" and \"Teenage Kicks\", as the 2013 Comic Relief single.[82] The charity single reached number one in the UK and Ireland,[83] while peaking at 13 in the US.[84] The music video for the charity single was shot in Ghana,[85] where the group volunteered at a children's hospital;[86] Tokyo; New York City; and London,[87] including at 10 Downing Street, featuring a cameo from the then-British prime minister David Cameron.[88] Following the release of Take Me Home, One Direction embarked on their second concert tour and first all-arena tour in February 2013, the Take Me Home Tour.[89][90] The concert tour consisted of 123 shows in Europe, North America, Asia, and Oceania.[67] Ticket sales reached 300,000 within a day of release in the UK and Ireland, which included a six-date sell-out at the O 2 Arena in London.[91] The tour grossed $114 million.[67] The Official Charts Company revealed that One Direction had sold 2,425,000 records in the UK by February 2013.[92]\n\n2013\u20132014: Midnight Memories and This Is Us\n\nOne Direction in Glasgow, Scotland, on their Take Me Home Tour in February 2013\n\n\"Best Song Ever\", the lead single of the group's then-upcoming third studio album Midnight Memories, was released on 22 July 2013.[93][94] The song is their highest-charting single in the US to date, reaching number two.[95] It broke the 24-Hour Vevo Record with 10.9 million views on YouTube.[96][97] One Direction: This Is Us, a 3D documentary and concert film about the group directed by Morgan Spurlock and produced by Spurlock, Ben Winston, Adam Milano and Simon Cowell, was released by TriStar Pictures on 30 August 2013.[98] The film was a box office success, topping the UK and US box offices and grossing over $60 million worldwide, and became the fourth highest-grossing concert movie.[99] In August, the group released their third book, One Direction: Where We Are: Our Band, Our Story: 100% Official.[100]\n\nOn 16 May 2013, the band announced their first all-stadium tour, the Where We Are Tour.[101] In support of Midnight Memories, the band participated in \"1D Day\", a day dedicated to One Direction fans.[102] The day constituted of a 7 hour interactive YouTube live-stream sponsored by Google, featuring live band performances and celebrity guests, including Simon Cowell, Khloe Kardashian, Kelly Rowland, Robbie Williams, Celine Dion, and Piers Morgan.[103][102][104] On 28 October 2013, the second single from Midnight Memories, \"Story of My Life\", was released, charting at number six in the US and at number two in the UK, while charting at number one in countries such as Mexico, Spain, Bulgaria, Denmark, and Ireland.[95][105]\n\nThe band performing in Glasgow in February 2013\n\nMidnight Memories was released globally on 25 November 2013.[106] It debuted at number one in the UK and in the US, making them the first group to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 with its first three albums, and the second to reach the top after the Monkees in 1967.[107] The album was described by the band as \"edgy\" and as having a \"slightly rockier tone\" than their previous efforts.[108] Despite being released at the year's end, it was the best-selling album worldwide in 2013 with 4 million copies sold globally.[109]\n\nIn December 2013, One Direction broke yet another UK sales record with the DVD and Blu-ray release of This Is Us. Nearly 270,000 copies of the film were sold in the UK within three days of its release, beating the record previously set by Michael Jackson's This Is It in 2010 by 10,000 copies.[110] The group were named among the Top Global artists of 2013 by the IFPI because of strong digital downloads, physical albums, on-demand streams, and music videos.[111]\n\nThe band embarked on the Where We Are Tour on 25 April 2014, and it was concluded on 5 October 2014. Playing 69 shows, the tour grossed over $290 million, becoming the highest-grossing concert tour in 2014 (grossing $87 million more than the second highest-grossing tour, Justin Timberlake's The 20/20 Experience World Tour), the 15th highest-grossing concert tour of all time, and the highest-grossing tour of all time by a vocal group.[112][113] The tour was attended by 3.4 million people.[113]\n\n2014\u20132015: Four and Malik's departure\n\nOne Direction on stage in Santiago, Chile, during their Where We Are Tour in April 2014\n\nIn July 2014, One Direction announced One Direction: Where We Are \u2013 The Concert Film, a film which documents the concerts of 28 and 29 June 2014 that took place in San Siro Stadium during their Where We Are Tour.

I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world.\"[128][129] In a subsequent interview, Malik denied rumours of a rift between the members and said, \"My band has been really supportive\".[130] In later interviews, Malik would say he left the group because he was unhappy with its musical direction and his inability to \"put any input in\".[131] On 14 May, the group made their first official public appearance as a four-piece on The Late Late Show with James Corden, where they confirmed that they would continue working without a new fifth member.[132]\n\n2015: Made in the A.M.\n\nOn 31 July 2015, the group released \"Drag Me Down\", the first single from their fifth studio album, Made in the A.M., and the first song released by the group after Malik's departure.[133] The single was released without promotional material or announcement,[134] and topped the charts in multiple countries.

Rolling Stone praised the album, highlighting its rock influence and comparing the album to works of classic rock bands such as Fleetwood Mac and The Verve, and other pop boy bands such as Backstreet Boys.[151] The album received general praise for its reflective and mature tone as the band's final project.[152] It was the fastest and the 14th best-selling album of 2015.[153][154] At the 2015 American Music Awards on 22 November, One Direction won the award for Artist of the Year for the second year in succession.[155] On 13 December, One Direction performed on The X Factor final. Their final televised performance as a group took place on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on 31 December 2015.[156]\n\n2016\u2013present: Hiatus and Payne's death\n\nIn January 2016, Us Weekly reported that the group's hiatus would become a permanent split, citing unnamed sources that claimed the band had not renewed recording contracts.[157][158][159] Representatives for the group denied the report in a statement to Billboard, saying that \"nothing has changed regarding hiatus plans for the group, and all will be revealed in due time from the band members' own mouths.\"[158][160]\n\nAt the 2017 Brit Awards on 22 February, One Direction won the Video of the Year award for their song \"History\". Payne, the only member in attendance, accepted the award on behalf of the band.[161] By May 2017, all members of the group had released solo singles.[162] Since then, all band members have pursued other projects and released at least one solo album.[163] In February 2018, it was reported that the group had folded its touring company after applying for removal within the Companies House registry in October 2017.[164]\n\nStyles would say in a 2017 interview that he was the first member of the group to bring up the idea of the hiatus in late 2014, saying he \"didn't want to exhaust\" their fanbase, and that all members later eventually agreed.[165] In 2023, Tomlinson remarked that the split felt like \"another loss\".[166][167] Malik stated that the band had gotten \"sick\" of each other by 2015, contributing to their split. Malik also said that the band was a great experience, but had run its course.[168][169] In a 2025 interview with The Diary of a CEO, Tomlinson stated \"all of a sudden, you get someone thinking more independently and more for themselves, which, by the way, they have every right to do. But the room felt cold that day\u2026 I've never quite felt an energy like that in the room\" regarding the initial discussion of a hiatus. Tomlinson also discussed the chance of a potential reunion, stating \"I can't ever imagine ... I'm not sure it would be right to [Payne],\" and \"there's no one who would have campaigned more for One Direction to come back than Liam\".[170]\n\nOn 16 October 2024, Liam Payne died after accidentally falling from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, Argentina. At the time of his death, the members of One Direction had not reunited since their hiatus began in 2016.[171][172] Following his death, Malik, Styles, Tomlinson, and Horan released a joint statement paying tribute to him.[173] One Direction's music saw a significant surge on charts around the world soon after Payne's death, which included all five of the group's albums returning to the top 40 of the UK Albums Chart as well as all five charting on the US Billboard 200.[174][175] Malik and Tomlinson will reunite for an upcoming documentary series created by Netflix in 2026; Horan and Styles are not expected to appear.[176][177] The series will follow their careers since the end of the band and the death of Payne.[178]\n\nArtistry\n\nOne Direction's debut studio album, Up All Night (2011), is predominantly a pop music record, containing elements of teen pop, dance-pop, pop rock, with electropop and rock influences.[183][184] Digital Spy's Robert Copsey described the album as a \"collection of PG pop rock with killer choruses\",[185] while The New York Times considered it \"full of easy rock-inflected pop, blithe and sometimes clever\".[186] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard acknowledged that the album demonstrates an originality in sound that was \"necessary for the revitalization of the boy band movement\".[184] The songs \"One Thing\" and \"What Makes You Beautiful\" were particularly noted for the genres of power pop and pop rock, for their \"powerhouse\" guitar riffs and \"forceful\" choruses.[179][180][183][187]\n\nTheir second album, Take Me Home (2012), is characterised by rock-inherited pop, prominent electric guitar riffs, bright synthesisers, a homogeneous sound and message, and the pitch-correcting software Auto-Tune.[78][79][188][72] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian interpreted its signature sound as a \"peppy, synth-bolstered take on early-80s new-wave pop, heavy on clipped rhythms and chugging guitars\", which, he said, is at least an improvement on the substitute contemporary R&B \"that was once the grim lot of the boy band\".[79] Jon Caramanica, writing in The New York Times, considered the album \"far more mechanical\" than their debut album, although noted that it is sonically and lyrically similar.[78] The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, commitment, jealousy and longing for past significant others.[78][79][188][189]\n\nTheir third album, Midnight Memories (2013), is a pop rock record, noted as a departure from the band's original teen pop sound by several media outlets. The album was influenced by 80's rock and briefly integrates elements of dubstep, notably in \"Little White Lies\".[190][191] The album's lyrical themes primarily revolve around love, heartbreak and sexual intercourse. Many critics praised its lyrical depth and musical composition, as well as the group's level of involvement in the production process.[192]\n\nRolling Stone praised the group's live performances, complimenting member Niall Horan's guitar playing.\n\nTheir fourth album, Four (2014), was described as \"edgier\" by Payne, who said the group had written most of its songs. He also said Horan had suggested the album be named to commemorate their fourth album in the band's four years. Billboard wrote of the album's first single, \"Steal My Girl\", that it was \"no What Makes You Beautiful, but its Coldplay-like piano pop could be a good direction\",[193] and that the band were \"not entirely ready to let go of its bubble-gum days\". Rolling Stone described the record as \"saturated with retro vibes\", saying that its songs \"split the difference between big, splashy Eighties pop rock and more elegant Seventies flavours \u2013 a very pesky whipper-snapper move that's not so far from what Haim's hit 'Days Are Gone' did last year\".[194]\n\nOne Direction's fifth and final album Made in the A.M. was noted as a \"slick-sounding\" pop record, committing to a reflective mood with more ballads than usual. The album experimented with jazz-fusion, indie, brit-pop, and synth-pop.[152][151][195] The album was noted as being sadder than previous ones released by the band, with several songs about failed relationships.

Rolling Stone called the group \"one of the great rock bands of the 21st century.\"[2]\n\nWaxwork of One Direction at Madame Tussauds, London\n\nOne Direction were noted by Billboard as \"barreling into international success\" and falling into \"seemingly effortless superstardom\".[283] Their main \"competitor\", in terms of boy bands, was the Wanted, with many expecting a \"rivalry\" like the one between NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys.[283] However, in a 2014 article by Billboard, they wrote \"the boy band war was over before it even began\" and that \"the boy band war was not a war at all; it had been a one-sided stomping\".[283] The Wanted went on indefinite hiatus in 2014, and they cited One Direction's global success as part of the reason, saying, \"One Direction are a phenomenon that no one else can compete with\" and \"for The Wanted to try and compete against one of the biggest bands in the world...it's almost impossible\".[284] One Direction's rise to fame has been called \"meteoric\". The group were the first British band whose debut album topped the US charts.[282] During their continued rise outside of the United Kingdom and Ireland, the mania surrounding the group was dubbed \"One Direction Infection\".[285][286][287] Part of the group's rise to popularity was their \"atypical construct\" in the sense that they did not dance, rarely wore matching outfits, and were heavily tattooed, all three of which were rare in boy bands of the past.[288] HuffPost added that they \"didn't just sing cheesy ballads\" and instead \"embraced their differences\".[281] Slate noted that One Direction portrayed more of a \"joking\" and \"fun\" manner in their songs, music videos, and individual personas when compared to boy bands of the past.[289] Each member of the group was applied a persona: Horan as \"the cute Irish one\", Malik as \"the quiet and mysterious one\", Payne as \"the sensible one\", Styles as \"the charming flirt\" and Tomlinson as \"the funny one\".[290]\n\nMadame Tussauds in London made wax sculptures of the band in 2013, retiring them in 2022, six years after the band's indefinite hiatus.[291] In 2017, ABC premiered the television series Boy Band which aims to find male vocalists to become a member of a new five-piece boy band. Many media outlets suspected the show's premise and inspiration was to find \"the next One Direction\".[292][293] In 2024, Simon Cowell announced open casting calls for the \"next One Direction\", stating that he did not believe a boy band had reached the success of the group since the band's conception.[294]\n\nCultural impact\n\nOne Direction have appeared and been referenced in several pieces of media. The band appeared in a 2012 episode of American teen sitcom iCarly,[54] and inspired an animated cartoon version of themselves as superheroes, styled after the Power Rangers, titled The Adventurous Adventures of One Direction.[295] Jukebox musical Glee covered One Direction's \"What Makes You Beautiful\" in the episode Prom-asaurus.[296] In 2014, the band appeared on season 45 of the educational children's television series Sesame Street, singing about the letter U in a parody of their song \"What Makes You Beautiful\".[297][298] The same year, writer Anna Todd published After, originally a One Direction fan fiction on Wattpad.[299][300][301] The band were mentioned in J.

The documentary received intense backlash from the fandom, believing the portrayal was inaccurate.[328]: 19\u201325 [324]: 3 [329][330] A 2022 article by Fast Company wrote that \"One Direction fangirls made the internet a better place\", and credited the group for shaping modern social media interactions between fandoms.[331] In a 2020 story in honour of the band's 10-year anniversary, Billboard wrote that their \"groundbreaking success\" was in part due to the group's dedicated global fanbase, and accelerated by the rise of social media and online music streaming, and rivalling any other boy band fandom in history.[4] After Malik left the band in March 2015, fan reactions went viral on social media.[332] Candlelight vigils held in memory of Malik went viral, with sites like Rolling Stone writing articles about fan reactions.[333] Madame Tussauds in London hired \"tissue attendants\" to comfort guests visiting wax sculptures of the band following Malik's departure.[334][335]\n\nOne Direction were prominently featured in Maria Sherman's 2020 book Larger Than Life: A History of Boy Bands from NKOTB to BTS.[336] In 2022, Kaitlyn Tiffany released a book titled Everything I Need I Get from You: How Fangirls Created the Internet as We Know It, focusing on the cultural impact and online community created by Directioners.[337]\n\nLarries\n\nLarries are a subsection of the One Direction fandom who believe in \"Larry Stylinson\", a portmanteau of Louis Tomlinson and Harry Styles.[3]: 226 It is a conspiracy theory that the pair are or were in a romantic relationship.[338] Larries have been one of the largest groups of the One Direction fandom since the band's conception,[339]: 173\u2013174 contributing to a 2011 tweet by Tomlinson to Styles becoming one of the most-retweeted tweets on Twitter, peaking as the second-most retweeted tweet of all time.[340][341][342]\n\nSales and tour records\n\nOne Direction have broken numerous records, including sales, charts, and streaming records, earning six Guinness World Records through their successes and becoming one of the best-selling boy bands of all time.[343][344][345] The band is reportedly worth over $1 billion through merchandise, album, and tour sales.[346] The band became the first British act to enter the Billboard 200 at number one.
