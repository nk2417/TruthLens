The \"Unsolved\" star discussed their \"questionable parenting decisions\" on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show back in June.\n\n\"I have no idea what I'm doing half the time. She's definitely more evolved than I am and more patient,\" he told DeGeneres. \"I'm just doing the best I can and trying not to screw him up for life.\"\n\nCo-parenting is a difficult but noble task for many couples. We applaud Duhamel and Fergie for their honesty and commitment to Axl's happiness.\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.", "images": ["https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a578ab4ec1ade37876e224c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a578ab4ec1ade37876e224d?width=700", "https://i.insider.com/651f2ddf6561dd877e7242d0?width=168&format=jpeg&auto=webp&crop=1:1,smart", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5a578ab4ec1ade37876e224c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Callie Ahlgrim", "Enter Your Email", "Follow Authors", "Never Miss A Story"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/josh-duhamel-fergie-co-parenting-divorce2018-1", "title": "Josh Duhamel called co-parenting with Fergie a 'juggling act' in first interview since their divorce", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Josh Duhamel called co-parenting with Fergie a 'juggling act' in first interview since their divorce", "datePublished": "2018-01-11T15:45:21.000Z", "dateModified": "2018-01-11T15:45:24.000Z", "news_keywords": "News, Relationships, Parenting, Celebrities, Health, Wellness, Culture", "description": "Josh Duhamel and Fergie were together for 13 years before announcing their split in September.
