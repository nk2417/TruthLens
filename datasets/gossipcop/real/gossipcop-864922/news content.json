Celine Dion posed in nothing but her birthday suit for Vogue on Tuesday, July 4, while in Paris for Fashion Week.\n\nIn a photo shared on the fashion magazine\u2019s Instagram account, the seven-time Grammy winner sits nude on a chair, her right leg crossed over her left, her arms wrapped around her torso, with her left hand covering the lower part of her face as she gazes mysteriously into the camera.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a little naked fact to ponder while Celine Dion changes looks between shows,\u201d the publication shared in a lengthy caption that explored the singer\u2019s fashion experiences. \u201cFor the past five years, she has worn haute couture near exclusively for her own performances.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars Go Nude!
