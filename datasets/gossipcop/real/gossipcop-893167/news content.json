In a year in which we\u2019ve lost Carl (Chandler Riggs), Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and possibly Maggie (Lauren Cohan), Jesus (Tom Payne) breathed his last. In typical heroic fashion, he died trying to get others to safety.\n\nWhile on a mission to rescue Eugene (Josh McDermott) with Daryl (Norman Reedus) and Aaron (Ross Marquand), the group found themselves in a graveyard with a new foe approaching. After fighting off a few walkers with ninja-like skill, Jesus took one last swing of the sword only to have the would-be walker duck, then stab him in the back. Other than Eugene and Rosita, this was the group\u2019s first encounter with the Whisperers, living humans hiding among the dead.\n\nFans did not take Jesus\u2019s death lightly.\n\nThough many mourn, Payne was ready for his stint on the show to end. He said in a recent interview that he had become frustrated and bored with the character\u2019s storyline.\n\nThe Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on AMC.\n\nCheck out the surprise twist at the end of Rick Grimes\u2019s final episode of The Walking Dead:\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nTell us what you think!
