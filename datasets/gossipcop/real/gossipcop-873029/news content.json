At the same time, participation in the sport only increased 4.5 percent, which means that more and more women are adopting athleisure wear into their daily uniform. And why not? They\u2019re versatile, seasonless and most of all, comfortable. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can all wear them willy-nilly. There\u2019s a time and a place for everything.\n\nNeed a review? Here are the dos and don\u2019ts on how to wear yoga pants around town without getting the side-eye.\n\nDO: Learn from Lululemon\u2019s sheer pants recall. Make sure you select a pair that is truly opaque. Test them out in broad daylight or under bright lights.\n\nDON\u2019T: Wear them to work. Ever. \u201cDress Pant Yoga Pants\u201d is an oxymoron.\n\nDO: Invest in the correct size. It sounds like a no-brainer, but often women will purchase a size down to get a tighter fit or a longer shelf life since yoga pants stretch out. In reality, all you end up with is \u201ccamel toe.\u201d Avoid at all costs.\n\nDON\u2019T: Show your panty lines. If thongs aren\u2019t your thing, Commando and Zobha make great full-coverage bikini bottoms that are undetectable.\n\nDO: Layer up! Throwing on a leather jacket or a dark trench over your yoga pants and T-shirt will instantly dress up your look when you\u2019re running from bikram to brunch.\n\nDON\u2019T: Keep wearing your favorite pair after the expiration date. Unlike jeans, yoga pants don\u2019t age well. Toss them when they\u2019re overly faded, stretched or ripped.\n\nDO: Accessorize! Nothing pulls together athleisure wear like a statement handbag and a pair of sunglasses.\n\nDON\u2019T: Try to pull off your zaniest tie-dye yoga pants outside your ashtanga class. Stock up on neutral colors \u2014 navy, black, charcoal \u2014 that will go with anything.\n\nDO: Consider your tight-fitting yoga pants a thicker alternative to leggings in the wintertime. On the weekends, pair with knee-high boots and an oversized sweater, or wear them underneath a dress. No one will know the difference.\n\nTo shop the best yoga pants on the market, click on the slideshow below.\n\n[ Next: 11 Best Yoga Pants to Buy Now, According to Reviews ]", "images": ["https://www.thefashionspot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/03/GettyImages-509996008.jpg?w=282&h=188&crop=1", "https://www.thefashionspot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/11/MixCollage-19-Nov-2025-11-35-AM-9559.jpg?w=182&h=122&crop=1", "https://www.thefashionspot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/06/fashionspot_image_place_holder_r01.jpg", "https://www.thefashionspot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/11/Anya.jpg?w=182&h=122&crop=1", "https://www.thefashionspot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2024/06/hitsandmisses-menswearpfw-spring25-featured.jpg?w=282&h=188&crop=1", "https://www.thefashionspot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/11/GettyImages-2246692081.jpg?w=182&h=122&crop=1", "https://www.thefashionspot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/gallery/yoga-pants-update/../../2023/06/fashionspot_image_place_holder_r01.jpg", "https://www.thefashionspot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/06/fashionspot_image_place_holder_r01.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.thefashionspot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/10/hitsandmisses-pfw-spring24-featured2.jpg?w=282&h=188&crop=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/973b4adc551ce2b5106b134468f0a4c6dae6ce80834ac7f009ad1dc7e63c84c4?s=96&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.thefashionspot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/01/Screen-Shot-2022-12-18-at-01.04.21.png?w=282&h=188&crop=1", "https://www.thefashionspot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2025/11/Addison-Rae.jpg?w=182&h=122&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.thefashionspot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/06/fashionspot_image_place_holder_r01.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Denardo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thefashionspot.com/style-trends/566985-how-to-wear-yoga-pants/", "title": "The Dos and Don\u2019ts of Wearing Yoga Pants Around Town", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Your ultimate guide on how to wear yoga pants around town and still look good.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Dos and Don'ts of Wearing Yoga Pants Around Town", "description": "Your ultimate guide on how to wear yoga pants around town and still look good.", "url": "https://www.thefashionspot.com/style-trends/566985-how-to-wear-yoga-pants/", "site_name": "theFashionSpot", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thefashionspot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/06/fashionspot_image_place_holder_r01.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 627, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheFashionSpot/", "published_time": "2016-04-15T15:39:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-10-18T14:11:09+00:00"}, "author": "Maria Denardo", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fashion_spot", "site": "@fashion_spot", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Maria Denardo", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8.3", "parsely-title": "The Dos and Don\u2019ts of Wearing Yoga Pants Around Town", "parsely-link": "http://www.thefashionspot.com/style-trends/566985-how-to-wear-yoga-pants/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://www.thefashionspot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/06/fashionspot_image_place_holder_r01.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-04-15T15:39:25Z", "parsely-section": "Style", "parsely-tags": "athleisure,fashion 101,fitness apparel,hot on the spot,how to wear,leggings,pants,yoga,yoga pants", "parsely-author": "Maria Denardo", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.thefashionspot.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2023/04/cropped-thefashionspot_icon_512x512-1.jpg?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1460734765.0, "source": "http://www.thefashionspot.com", "summary": ""}
