He also must serve two years of supervised released, pay a $10,000 fine and complete 500 hours of community service.\n\nSorrentino and his brother Marc Sorrentino were charged for filing false tax returns and inaccurately reporting some $8.9 million in income. Mike Sorrentino pleaded guilty to tax evasion and concealing income in January. Marc Sorrentino also was sentenced Friday to two years in prison and a $75,000 fine.\n\nSeveral of The Situation\u2019s cast mates came to court to support Sorrentino at his sentencing including, Deena Nicole Cortese, Paul \u201cPauly D\u201d Delvecchio,\u201d Jenni \u201cJWoww\u201d Farley, Vinny Guadagnino and Ronnie Ortiz-Magro.\n\nSorrentino starred on MTV\u2019s Jersey Shore from 2009 to 2012 and currently appears on the show\u2019s spinoff Jersey Shore Family Vacation.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nIt\u2019s not known when Sorrentino will begin serving his sentence. According to media reports he plans to marry his fiancee next month before reporting to prison, so it\u2019s likely be able to finish work on Jersey Shore Family Vacation, which is currently in production on Season 2. If renewed for a third season though, it\u2019s highly unlikely Sorrentino would be able to continue. Maybe MTV will film cast members visiting him in prison? Just a thought.", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-situation.jpg?w=630", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-situation.jpg?w=630&h=383&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-situation.jpg?w=630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Denise Petski", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/10/jersey-shore-the-situation-sentenced-prison-tax-evasion-1202477334/", "title": "\u2018Jersey Shore\u2019s The Situation Sentenced To Prison For Tax Evasion", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Jersey Shore star Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino has been sentenced to eight months in prison for tax evasion.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Denise Petski", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Jersey Shore\u2019s The Situation Sentenced To Prison For Tax Evasion", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/10/jersey-shore-the-situation-sentenced-prison-tax-evasion-1202477334/", "description": "Jersey Shore star Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino has been sentenced to eight months in prison for tax evasion.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-situation.jpg?w=630", "width": 630, "height": 620, "alt": "The Situation"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-10-05T19:29:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-10-05T21:49:29+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Jersey Shore star Mike \"The Situation\" Sorrentino has been sentenced to eight months in prison for tax evasion.", "site": "@Deadline", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Jersey Shore\u2019s The Situation Sentenced To Prison For Tax Evasion", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/the-situation.jpg?w=630"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1538767776.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
