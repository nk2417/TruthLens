Zoe's mom is former \"The Cosby Show\" and \"A Different World\" star Lisa Bonet. Getty Images\n\nThe \"Fly Away\" singer shares Zoe with his ex-wife, former \"The Cosby Show\" and \"A Different World\" star Lisa Bonet.\n\nHe romanced Kidman, 50, back in 2003, two years after her split from ex-hubby Tom Cruise \u2014 and two years before she met Keith Urban, 50, whom she married in 2006.\n\nApparently Kidman looks back fondly on her time with Kravitz. After all, she was the one who revealed the pair were once secretly engaged.\n\nZoe Kravitz and Nicole Kidman currently star together in HBO's Emmy-winning series \"Big Little Lies.\" FilmMagic\n\nDuring a February 2017 interview with The EDIT, the Oscar winner casually revealed the special connection she shared with her younger \"Big Little Lies\" co-star.\n\n\"Well, I knew Zoe because I was engaged to her father,\" she shared, adding jokingly, \"It's all in the family!\"\n\nKidman obviously still thinks her old flame is pretty terrific. \"I love Lenny; he's a great guy,\" she said right after dropping her bombshell.\n\nStill friends: Lenny Kravitz poses with Nicole Kidman and her husband, Keith Urban, in 2013. WireImage\n\nAs for Zoe, she considers herself lucky to be acting with the woman who nearly became her stepmom.\n\nShe called Kidman a \"beast of an actress\" in the same interview.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so good that sometimes it was distracting,\" Zoe gushed. \"After every take I wanted to just stop and say, \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d\n\nMonths later, in June 2017, Zoe shared happy childhood memories of Kidman.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t seen her in a long time before 'Big Little Lies,' but there was a point where we were all kind of living together,\" she told the EDIT. \"I was about 13, and she would take me to see movies; she was so nice to me.\"", "images":
