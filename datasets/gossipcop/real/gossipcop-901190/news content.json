Every single thing about our relationship is better,\u201d the 29-year-old Vanderpump Rules star tells Us Weekly exclusively. \u201cI know how much he\u2019s wanting the wedding and how much he\u2019s wanting to marry me, how much effort he\u2019s putting into the wedding, just as much as me. I don\u2019t know, whenever you know somebody as well as I know Jax, you can just tell.\u201d\n\nJax, who popped the question in June, was caught cheating on Brittany with former SURver, Faith Stowers, during season 6.

I feel like we\u2019re almost starting over, but we\u2019ve grown so much. He does things before I even ask him now. Even just helping around the house. I can just tell in our everyday lives that he\u2019s changed.\u201d\n\nJax, a Florida native, for his part, tells Us that he was \u201cthis person\u201d Brittany is referring to before he moved to Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI just kind of fell into kind of a deep hole and that happens out here sometimes. You get sucked into this lifestyle,\u201d he says. \u201cYou start hanging out with people you probably shouldn\u2019t, you start doing things you probably shouldn\u2019t and sometimes, you know, you have to fall down to get back up.\u201d\n\nThe former SUR bartender explains that he hit his \u201clowest\u201d point in December 2017 after his father died.\n\nRelated: Couples Who Survived the Reality TV Curse (So Far) Who says true love doesn\u2019t exist on reality TV?
