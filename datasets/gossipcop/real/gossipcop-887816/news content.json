And I think I crack him up\u2014unless he's a really good actor and great at faking laughter.\"\n\nFaris added, \"It's understandable that people seemed so invested in our happiness together. All I can say about that is, it's all true, that we truly adore each other, and we love each other. I think it still comes through.\" I'm not crying, you are!\n\nThe House Bunny star's new book, Unqualified, comes out next week and includes plenty of details about Faris and Pratt's love story, their island wedding, and their five-year-old son Jack, as well as a foreword penned by Pratt himself. \"I am so grateful that he contributed to the book. Chris and I are really great friends, and I think that we always will be,\" Faris said of her ex's intro, in which Pratt reportedly notes that he and Faris will be \"just fine\" following their separation and will move forward together as they \"amicably coparent a human.\"\n\n\"At first I thought, 'Oh my gosh, this is crazy timing,'\" she told People of deciding to move forward with releasing a book about marriage and relationships in the wake of her separation. \"Now it sort of feels like maybe, in a way, everything that's happened helps bring it full circle.\"\n\nSince announcing the end of their eight-year marriage via a joint statement on social media in August, the couple has, for the most part, stayed mum on the topic. In September, however, while Faris was presenting an award at the Primetime Emmys, Pratt praised her performance onstage\u2014despite not being in attendance at the ceremony. \"I know she did great. Anna did an amazing job, she rules,\" he told a paparazzo in a video captured by TMZ. \"She was great. Her and Allison [Janney]\u2014they both looked great.\" He finished with a supportive plug for Faris and Janney's hit show, on which he once costarred as Faris' love interest: \"Go watch Mom on CBS!\" We will, Chris, as we dream of happier days.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/691ca6075dbfbce9d766d347/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6902550543870bc942f7c5c3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e782937f7b2b4f4cae456b/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/chriss%2520pratt%2520anna%2520faris.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/67a23d1cd1380148e0159eab/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68fa94268b4d1b984ef3ef23/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690b97320073fb740a2809dc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e782937f7b2b4f4cae456b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chriss%20pratt%20anna%20faris.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691103b499dd90c7e1bb1bfc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6914b1943b12b3ab44344370/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/688fc705711fa5299d576da4/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690cc1655625e2a9de14e258/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_640%2Cq_80%2Cw_640/v1615582646/glamour_demi-lovato-reacts-to-youtube-covers-of-her-songs.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/glamour-banner-v2.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/logo-oneNav.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/69010e90a18581c0faf5cbcc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/620d55d803e4447bb1303cbe/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e782937f7b2b4f4cae456b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chriss%20pratt%20anna%20faris.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrea Park"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/anna-faris-chris-pratt-will-always-have-each-other", "title": "Anna Faris Says She and Chris Pratt Will Always Be 'Incredible Friends'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Andrea Park", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "In the new issue of 'People,' Anna Faris says that she and ex-husband Chris Pratt still have 'so much laughter' and friendship in their lives together.", "id": "59e77f03017a263f7ded2eea", "keywords": "anna faris,chris pratt", "news_keywords": "anna faris,chris pratt", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59e77f03017a263f7ded2eea", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In the new issue of 'People,' Anna Faris says that she and ex-husband Chris Pratt still have 'so much laughter' and friendship in their lives together.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e782937f7b2b4f4cae456b/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/chriss%20pratt%20anna%20faris.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e782937f7b2b4f4cae456b/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/chriss%20pratt%20anna%20faris.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "No, you're crying!", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e782937f7b2b4f4cae456b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chriss%20pratt%20anna%20faris.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Anna Faris Says She and Chris Pratt Will 'Always Have Each Other'", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/anna-faris-chris-pratt-will-always-have-each-other"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-10-18T17:15:12.554Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-18T17:15:12.554Z", "author": "Andrea Park"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "No, you're crying!", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e782937f7b2b4f4cae456b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chriss%20pratt%20anna%20faris.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Anna Faris Says She and Chris Pratt Will 'Always Have Each Other'"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59e782937f7b2b4f4cae456b/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/chriss%20pratt%20anna%20faris.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508346912.554, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
