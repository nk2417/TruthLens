Danielle Maltby opened up about her history with Wells Adams and gushed over his new relationship with Sarah Hyland.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Friendly Exes: Hollywood\u2019s Ex-Lovers Who Have Stayed Close Love lost doesn't mean friendship lost for these friendly exes! Take a look at ex-lovers such as Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake, Hilary Duff and Mike Comrie, and Ryan Phillippe and Reese Witherspoon, who have maintained close relationships even after splitting up.\n\n\u201cOh, of course we are [still friends]. I\u2019m so happy for him,\u201d Maltby exclusively told Us Weekly on Monday, December 4. \u201cI\u2019ve met Sarah. Sarah is amazing.\u201d\n\nThe Bachelor alum also revealed what makes Adams and Hyland, 27, such a dynamic duo. \u201cThey bounce off of each other so well, like they really bring out the best of each other,\u201d she shared. \u201cLike they\u2019re both so funny and amp each other up so much. And the smile that Wells gets on his face is unreal. It\u2019s so cute. It really is so cute.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the Nashville-based nurse and the Your Favorite Thing podcast host sent Bachelor Nation fans into a frenzy when they shared a passionate kiss on Bachelor in Paradise this summer right before Maltby left the show. After the episode aired, the pair explained on Adams\u2019 podcast that, although they had briefly dated several years ago, they are just really good friends.\n\nMaltby told Us there is no awkwardness between herself and the Modern Family star, who has been dating Adams for several months. \u201cNo, she\u2019s really awesome,\u201d the reality star noted, adding that the couple seem really serious. \u201cThey spend a lot of time together. Any time Sarah comes to town she\u2019s like, \u2018Danielle!\u2019 and I\u2019m like \u2018Sarah, it\u2019s so good to see you!\u2019 It\u2019s cute.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Bachelorette After the Final Rose: Broken Engagements, Weddings, Babies, and More!

We are just friends now. If things progress romantically, we\u2019re going to take our time with that and not worry about the show or anything like that trying to make us something that we\u2019re not ready to be. I knew I always wanted to make out with her because she\u2019s gorgeous and awesome and one of my friends. But she\u2019s not part of my friend group, she\u2019s part of my inner circle of friends. So in Nashville I think that was just too weird.\u201d\n\nRelated: 10 Times \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 Made Our Heads Explode!

They really like each other.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
