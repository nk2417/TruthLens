That is, save for one: Lincoln Adim, who was convicted of indecent assault and battery offscreen as the show aired its pretaped season. Adim will not be present, nor will the season\u2019s finalists\u2014including Garrett Yrigoyen, whose social-media history also caused a furor among fans.\n\nThe \u201cMen Tell All\u201d episode, which tapes later than the competition portion of the series, has traditionally been used as a platform on which the show can discuss controversies like these, which took place offscreen while the series aired. (The special was recorded just this week.) But with Adim and Yrigoyen absent from the group, this one will gloss over both controversies\u2014which, together, have been the center of most of the season\u2019s discussion. Both Kufrin and franchise host and producer Chris Harrison, however, want viewers to keep an open mind\u2014at least, regarding Yrigoyen.\n\n\u201cI want to be very careful about people that put Garrett and Lincoln in the same sentence because they do not belong in the same sentence,\u201d Harrison told The Hollywood Reporter after the episode finished filming. \u201cWhat Garrett did is something that people disagree with. What Lincoln did is illegal. It\u2019s against the law. He committed a crime. He was convicted of that, so that\u2019s very different. . . . That\u2019s not to say that I agree at all with what Garrett did or if he stood for that or what he stood for,\u201d Harrison added, \u201cbut I\u2019m very careful to differentiate those.\u201d\n\nFor those who need a refresher, Yrigoyen emerged as a front-runner as soon as this season premiered, nabbing the coveted First Impression Rose\u2014which is frequently awarded to the show\u2019s eventual winner. Just as the season premiered, however, Yrigoyen\u2019s offscreen life proved troublesome: on a subsequently deleted Instagram account, Yrigoyen had \u201cliked\u201d offensive posts that ran the gamut of transphobia and anti-immigrant sentiments\u2014as well as a post supporting the conspiracy theory that teenaged Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg was a crisis actor.\n\nAdim, meanwhile was convicted in May for indecent assault and battery, after an incident that occurred back in 2016. At the time of his conviction, Warner Bros. Television, which produces The Bachelor and all its offshoots, indicated to V.F. through a statement that no one on the show\u2019s production had any knowledge about Adim\u2019s history, adding that it was investigating how the third-party company it employs to run its background checks missed this. Speaking with T.H.R., Harrison had no concrete information to offer regarding how the shows might alter their vetting process to prevent such oversights in the future.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4e2c719bedd20c4002b7a8/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/t-Bachelorette-Dudes.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690ceab84ab9d3e623decb16/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b58a53686763009a9857ce3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/149913_0150.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b0d58d814785d7498401a02/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/bachelorette-garrett.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/66e3496b1d2e398b5578d9d4/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69120b5a02774bc2b727aee8/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b57233211d0902df883bd10/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/bachelorette-final-two-garrett-blake.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e0661d7f7e7718194d67e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6914ab554a83822bb12772b6/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690a490b7e88452d77fcf4b2/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b58a53686763009a9857ce3/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/149913_0150.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690cf5156fd8f93f16471dcd/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68f681830b14cb66007b0480/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fb8e54c721f87930d61aba/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68f6d3f2b39e02ae10fc9789/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b58a53686763009a9857ce3/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/149913_0150.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Bradley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/bachelorette-men-tell-all-garrett-yrigoyen-instagram-lincoln-adim-conviction", "title": "The Bachelorette\u2019s \u201cMen Tell All\u201d Episode Will Ignore This Season\u2019s Biggest Problems", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Laura Bradley", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "All of Becca Kufrin\u2019s jilted contestants will be back, save for Lincoln Adim, who was convicted of indecent assault and battery\u2014a detail that won\u2019t be addressed during next week\u2019s episode.
