(Watch the full frosty encounter here!)\n\n\u201cYou have to love people from a distance sometimes, and when the [fame] came about, she totally changed,\u201d says Shannon, 37, of her mother Sandy. \u201cShe was not supportive. She wanted to sell crazy stories and wanted to start trouble.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey love the drama, so hey, let them stay with the drama with Sugar Bear and Jennifer,\u201d she adds. \u201cI can stay out of it and be myself!\u201d\n\nAnd despite Lamb\u2019s attempts to sabotage Shannon\u2019s daughters\u2019 diets with sweet treats, Shannon insists \u201cJennifer and Sugar Bear have nothing to do with my kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cY\u2019all are seeing how Sugar Bear really is,\u201d she says. \u201cAs this season ends, y\u2019all will be able to see more. Then we\u2019re also doing a special where y\u2019all will see the actual real side of Sugar Bear. The world is going to be shocked.\u201d\n\nAccording to Shannon, Thompson also doesn\u2019t have a strong relationship with the daughter the two share, Alana \u201cHoney Boo Boo\u201d Thompson.\n\n\u201cHe chooses not to be a part of Alana\u2019s life,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that\u2019s on him, not me.\u201d\n\nGetty (2)\n\nAnd Alana, 11, would have to agree: During an interview with Entertainment Tonight on Thursday, the Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star opened up about her \u201cnonexistent\u201d relationship with her father.\n\n\u201cHe calls me every once in a blue moon, so if there\u2019s a blue moon outside, he\u2019s going to call me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe other day we were on the phone \u2026 and he was like, \u2018I need to cut my grass,\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201cSo I was like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll come do it, but I\u2019m going to need a ride mower,\u2019 and he said, \u2018You\u2019re gonna need a push mower, \u2019cause it wouldn\u2019t hurt\u2026\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201c[He said] \u2018It wouldn\u2019t hurt if you lose weight,\u2019 \u201d Shannon interjected. \u201cAnd I think that was the most ignorant thing that he could ever have told anybody. I would never say that.\u201d\n\nFROM COINAGE: The Most Expensive TV Shows of All Time\n\nAlana said she was \u201cmore mad of the point that he said [that].\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get this shape from not eating,\u201d she said. \u201cThe other day, I was talking to him again and he said it again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, it pissed me off, I\u2019m not gonna lie,\u201d confessed Shannon. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about this. It makes me ill every time I talk about him.\u201d\n\nThe finale of Mama June: From Not to Hot airs Friday at 9 p.m. ET on WE tv.", "images":
