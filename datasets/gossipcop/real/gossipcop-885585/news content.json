As part of the listing, Woods\u2019 agent, Allen Gammons, said in a news release that Woods is retiring from acting and is looking to \u201csimplify his life\u201d by selling \u201chis many real estate holdings on both coasts.\u201d\n\nIt seems like Gammons might have complicated Woods\u2019 life instead, as Woods was prompted to set the record straight on social media.\n\nWhile Woods was busy setting the record straight on his future, the actor bluntly asserted that he has no interested in running for politics in California.\n\nPerhaps bolstered by the false reports of Woods\u2019 retirement, fans of the actor began calling foe the actor to run for Congress.\n\n\u201c#WoodsForCongress @RealJamesWoods WE LOVE YOU SIR! YOU WOULD MAKE A STRONG ALLY OF PRESIDENT TRUMP,\u201d read one call for Woods to enter the political fray.\n\n\u201cYou really should think about running,\u201d another encouraging tweet read. \u201cYou can\u2019t be bought and you actually think about every issue.\u201d\n\nAlas, it appears that a Congressman James Woods won\u2019t be a reality any time soon.\n\n\u201cI sincerely appreciate the thought, but I would rather drink battery acid than be involved in California politics,\u201d Woods responded.\n\nThe reports of my retirement are greatly exaggerated\u2026 (???? to Mark Twain) \u2014 James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) October 8, 2017\n\n#WoodsForCongress @RealJamesWoods WE LOVE YOU SIR!
