Can't you blame my head and not my heart? I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right but, promise there were no feelings involved,\" Puth continues. \"I'll admit, it's my fault, but you gotta believe me. When I say it only happened once. I try and I try, but you'll never see that. You're the only one I wanna love, oh yeah.\"\n\nPuth and Gomez collaborated on 2016's \"We Don't Talk Anymore,\" and were linked romantically the year before -- until Gomez made it clear they were just \"friends.\" The former Disney star is currently dating The Weeknd.\n\n\"I'm trying to evade the question,\" Puth admitted when asked about his relationship with Gomez in a 2016 radio interview. \"We're friends, and I'm very happy to have collaborated with her. She's a really awesome singer.\"", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/charlieputh_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-01/1280_charlie_puth_selena_gomez_jingle_ball_011017.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-01/1280_charlie_puth_selena_gomez_jingle_ball_011017.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1024&quality=80"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-01/1280_charlie_puth_selena_gomez_jingle_ball_011017.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/fans-think-there-might-be-selena-gomez-reference-charlie-puths-new-music-video-89568", "title": "Fans Think There Might Be a Selena Gomez Reference in Charlie Puth's New Music Video", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-01/1280_charlie_puth_selena_gomez_jingle_ball_011017.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "Puth was romantically linked to Gomez in 2015.", "title": "Fans Think There Might Be a Selena Gomez Reference in Charlie Puth's New Music Video", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/fans-think-there-might-be-selena-gomez-reference-charlie-puths-new-music-video-89568", "type": "Article"}, "description": "Puth was romantically linked to Gomez in 2015.", "twitter": {"description": "Puth was romantically linked to Gomez in 2015.", "title": "Fans Think There Might Be a Selena Gomez Reference in Charlie Puth's New Music Video", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/fans-think-there-might-be-selena-gomez-reference-charlie-puths-new-music-video-89568", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-01/1280_charlie_puth_selena_gomez_jingle_ball_011017.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Fans Think There Might Be a Selena Gomez Reference in Charlie Puth's New Music Video | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, Music, News, Charlie Puth, Selena Gomez", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
