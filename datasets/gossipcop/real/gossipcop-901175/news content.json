In honor of her efforts and social impact, she was chosen as the evening's special guest and will push the Waterford crystal button that drops the ball in Times Square starting the countdown to the new year.\n\nSeems like 2018 is already looking up.\n\n\"I am delighted to be participating in this momentous occasion,\" Burke said in a statement. \"I think it\u2019s fitting to honor the Me Too movement as we close a historic year and set our intentions for 2018. With the new year comes new momentum to fuel this work and we won\u2019t stop anytime soon.\"\n\nBurke's \"Me Too\" campaign gained traction this year after sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein began to surface. Actress Alyssa Milano used the #MeToo hashtag to encourage women to share their own stories of sexual harassment and assault, which was shared more than 100,000 times in its first 24 hours.\n\nMashable Trend Report Decode what\u2019s viral, what\u2019s next, and what it all means.

honoring \"The Silence Breakers\" \u2014 all the women, including Burke, who spoke out against sexual assault and harassment this year \u2014 as 2017's \"Person of the Year.\"\n\n#MeToo played a key role in encouraging women and all those who've experienced sexual misconduct to share their voices and stand up for themselves, so the fact that Burke was chosen as the special guest by the event's co-organizers is sending a powerful message.\n\n\"New Year\u2019s is a time when we look at the most significant cultural and political moments of the last year, when we look for inspiration by honoring and giving a global platform to those who have made a difference,\" Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, said in the release.\n\n\"Tarana Burke\u2019s courage and foresight have changed the world this year, and, we hope, forever,\" he added.\n\nAs the activist tweeted alongside her Twitter announcement, \"We are setting intentions for the new year.\"", "images":
