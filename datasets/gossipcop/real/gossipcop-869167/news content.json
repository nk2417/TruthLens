From her adorable new romcom Our Little Secret to filming Freakier Friday, Lindsay\u2019s been busy. Yet somehow despite doing all the things, she looks legit better than ever. In November, I hopped on a Zoom call with Lindsay to chat about her partnership with Nexxus and I haven\u2019t stopped thinking about how warm and lovely she was...and how freaking incredible her skin looked ever since.\n\nAs a skin-obsessed beauty editor, I need to know exactly what she has done and what she\u2019s using on her face. Lindsay has staunchly claimed that her ~glow-up~ is thanks to a combo of skincare and noninvasive treatments. In her Cosmo cover story from 2022, she did share that she\u2019s a big fan of IPL facial lasers for clearer, brighter skin and Morpheus8, a microneedling and radiofrequency treatment that can help tighten and firm your skin by encouraging collagen production. She recently told Allure that she simply takes good care of her skin with and .\n\nLast month, Michael Lohan, Lindsay\u2019s father, denied that she had any plastic surgery but confirmed that she\u2019s done Botox, chemical peels, and fillers. Then this week, Lindsay shared a snap to her IG Stories with her dermatologist Radmila Lukian, MD, founder of Lucia Clinic in Dubai, seemingly doubling down on the ~it\u2019s just the light stuff~ vibes.\n\nI know the types of results you can get from microneedling, lasers, and Botox. I\u2019ve done them myself. But in Lindsay\u2019s case I know, deep in my soul, there's gotta be more to the story, and I had to get to the bottom of it. Ya know, so I can hopefully, one day, look as good as her. So I asked experts, specifically plastic surgeons, to weigh in on what they think Lindsay has done (and hasn\u2019t done) to get her face and skin looking this damn good. Here\u2019s what they had to say.\n\nGetty Images\n\nLifestyle habits\n\nThis feels kinda basic, but its importance can\u2019t be understated: Many of the changes in Lindsay\u2019s appearance can be attributed to changes in her life. \u201cSobriety, a healthy lifestyle, and fluctuations in weight can all have significant effects on the appearance of your skin and face,\u201d says plastic surgeon David Shafer, MD, owner of the Shafer Clinic in New York, NY. For starters, \u201ca sober lifestyle can mean skin that\u2019s less puffy and inflamed and more hydrated and clear,\u201d he explains, because alcohol can cause dryness, dullness, dark circles, and inflammation. Similarly, a change in your eating habits\u2014that is, swapping for a high-antioxidant diet with lots of fruits and vegetables and protein\u2014plus an increase in physical activity and better sleep hygiene can all improve your skin\u2019s appearance, Dr. Shafer adds. Another thing: Losing weight can, obviously, make your face appear slimmer, resulting in a stronger, more pronounced jawline, which many have noticed on Lindsay.\n\nAnother huge impact on her skin potentially? Pregnancy. Smoking, alcohol, and excess sun exposure would also stop during pregnancy, which would not only limit potential skin damage but also possibly even improve any existing spots and signs of dullness. There\u2019s also the fact that \u201cyou can\u2019t get Botox while pregnant, and it\u2019s not recommended to have fillers or many other treatments except for facials,\u201d says plastic surgeon Gabriel Chiu, MD. \u201cPrior to pregnancy, her face showed signs of filler fatigue as well as filler migration in her cheeks, which started to go away and then really improved from July to September of this year,\" he adds. He theorizes she dissolved excess fillers, then utilized thermal treatments like RF microneedling (like Morpheus8, Vivace, Secret, and Genius) or Thermage to help tighten and firm her skin instead.\n\nPlastic surgery\n\nLindsay hasn\u2019t confirmed she\u2019s gone under the knife, but many surgeons believe she\u2019s had a few surgical things done based on their expertise. \u201cHer results cannot be achieved by any singular treatment,\u201d Dr. Chiu says. Based on the photos he\u2019s seen, Dr. Chiu believes Lindsay \u201clikely had upper and lower blepharoplasty with fat transfer to her under-eyes to account for the changes around her eyes.\u201d For the uninitiated, an upper and lower blepharoplasty is eyelid surgery that can help sagging and/or puffy under-eyes and lids.\n\n\u201cPrior, she had puffiness and heaviness from excess fat pads of her upper eyelids and lower eyelid skin excess causing creases, along with a depression in the inner corner of her eyes,\u201d he adds. \u201cThis could also have been improved with platelet-rich fibrin injections or under-eye filler and resurfacing\u2014along with sobriety\u2014but correction of the excess medial fat pads of the upper eyes is likely surgical in nature,\u201d he explains. Iiiiiinteresting.\n\nA rhinoplasty could also be the reason for the lift in the tip of her nose, says Dr. Chiu. Filler and makeup can potentially help do this, but this wouldn\u2019t be a permanent option, unlike a surgical rhinoplasty. \u201cThere is a technique that I use in rhinoplasty that will will shorten the nose, lift the central portion between the nostrils, and shorten the space between your nose and lips to provide more upper lip show, all of which are in Lindsay\u2019s improved look,\u201d he adds.\n\nAs much as we talk about traditional plastic surgery, though, part of Lindsay\u2019s look could also point to a change in her teeth. Dr. Chiu says that veneers can actually help push out your lips a bit and make them look fuller. The more ya know!\n\nGetty Images\n\nBotox and fillers\n\nContrary to Dr. Chiu (and pretty much the entirely of the internet at this point), plastic surgeon Ari Hoschander, MD, doesn\u2019t believe Lindsay\u2019s had any facial plastic surgery done. \u201cI have looked at older photos of her throughout the years, and I don\u2019t see much actual structural change in her face,\u201d he notes. Instead, he points to some cheek filler and neuromodulators, like Botox, Jeuveau, Daxxify, or Xeomin. \u201cWhat is very clear to me is that she did not have surgery\u2014a rhinoplasty, brow lift, eyelid surgery, or facelift\u2014 which everyone else seems to think she had,\u201d he says. Instead, he thinks people are speculating based on paparazzi photos in unflattering lights. (Relatable\u2014if you compared my thirst traps to the rogue front-camera selfies I accidentally took, you\u2019d think I had $300,000 worth of plastic surgery too.)\n\nSome people assume Lindsay\u2019s had a facelift, but plastic surgeon Dhivya Srinivasa , MD, believes she had a lot of her previous filler dissolved instead. Then she potentially used RF microneedling to lift and tighten her skin before restarting with fillers. This could help create a much more seamless look\u2014and potentially even mimic the look of a facelift depending on where the new fillers were placed.\n\n\u201cThere appears to be very slight differences in her eyebrows and eyelids,\u201d says Dr. Hoschander, \u201cbut these are extremely minor and likely due to either Botox or how she grooms her eyebrows now versus then.\u201d\n\nNoninvasive cosmetic treatments\n\nDr. Hoschander, however, does credit the improvement in Lindsay\u2019s skin to in-office skin treatments, like Fraxel, Erbium, and/or CO2, as well as RF microneedling. \u201cWhen it is hard to place a finger on exactly what someone has done, the results are likely from having well-planned treatment combinations in an appropriate sequence that allows for proper healing and recovery for maximal benefits,\u201d Dr. Chiu says.\n\nHer jawline also could be a result of a skin-tightening treatment, like Renuvion, which uses \u201cplasma energy applied to the tissues under the skin along the jawline to improve definition and create slimness,\u201d says Dr. Chiu. But she never really had any face sagging or jowls, though, says Dr. Hoschander. \u201cShe definitely lost a little weight and that could contribute to the slimmer, more structured appearance of her face,\u201d he says.\n\nMakeup and hair\n\nThis one also feels kinda basic, but it\u2019s true: Seemingly simple changes can have a strong effect on your appearance, says plastic surgeon Samuel Lin, MD. \u201cIt is amazing what a makeup artist can do with subtle changes,\u201d he says. Plastic surgeon Gabriel Chiu, MD, explains that lightening her hair color and changing her part to the center \u201chas shortened the appearance of her forehead as well as help brighten her look to make her appear more youthful and vibrant,\u201d he says. Her lip color is also slightly overlined, which shortens the distance from the bottom of her nose to her lips.\n\n\u201cThere are some who think she may have had a lip lift, which would accomplish the same look, but I don\u2019t believe she did,\u201d he adds. \u201cHer makeup has generally been applied more professionally with lighter tones, which brightens up her face and has helped to give her a smoother, even texture,\u201d he notes.\n\n\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nObviously, we won\u2019t know exactly what Lindsay\u2019s done until she tells us herself. (Hi, Linds, I will gladly write this expos\u00e9.) But for now, I can tell you that really good skincare, unfortunately, doesn\u2019t yield results like this. If that were the case, every beauty editor would be aging in reverse too.\n\n\u201cI always say my biggest goal when working with patients is for people to notice how good and refreshed they look but have a hard time putting a finger on why,\u201d says Dr. Shafer. \u201cTweaks that have subtle yet impactful results are how you know it\u2019s good work done by a professional,\u201d he adds. This is how you get a natural look\u2014\u201cenhancing your features rather than altering them drastically,\u201d he adds. And that, folks, is exactly what we\u2019re all after.\n\nMeet the experts:", "images":
