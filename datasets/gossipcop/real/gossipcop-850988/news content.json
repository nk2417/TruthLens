After graduating in 2008, Pippa worked at a public relations firm, then as an event planner in London. She married hedge fund manager James Matthews on May 20, 2017.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBorn Philippa Charlotte Middleton in Reading, Berkshire, England, on September 6, 1983, Pippa Middleton is the second of three children of Carole and Michael Middleton. Middleton's older sister, Kate, was born in 1982 and is the Duchess of Cambridge through her marriage to Prince William. Her younger brother James, born in 1987, is a businessman.\n\nMiddleton's parents met working for British Airways \u2014 Carole was a flight attendant, and Michael was first a flight attendant, then a flight dispatcher. In 1984, the couple moved to Amman, Jordan, where they were based briefly. In 1987, the Middleton family was back in England, living at Bradfield Southend in the county of Berkshire. Carole started a company called Party Pieces, selling decorations and accessories for children's parties. Middleton and her siblings got their first taste of the spotlight modeling for Party Pieces catalogs. Party Pieces went on to become a successful business.\n\nLike her older sister, Middleton attended Britain's elite schools, first at St. Andrew's School in Pangbourne, then Downe House, a girls' boarding school, and then Marlborough College at Wiltshire. She was known as an organized and attentive student and the more outgoing of the Middleton sisters. Though they were reportedly bullied at times, Middleton was popular with her fellow students. Middleton studied English literature at the University of Edinburgh, where she mixed with the children of the dukes and earls \u2014 her group of friends was known as the \"castle crew.\" She dated George Percy, the son of the Duke of Northumberland. Percy's family castle was used as Hogwarts castle in the Harry Potter films.\n\nRise to Fame\n\nAfter graduating in 2008, Middleton worked at a public relations firm, then as an event planner in London. She was often spotted out at London's poshest nightclubs and on the arm of handsome young aristocrats.\n\nIt was Middleton's sister, Kate, who changed the family's fortunes for good. As a freshman at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, Kate befriended and began dating, a young Prince William.\n\nAs Britons paid close attention to the future king's romance, Middleton became a familiar face. Often spotted out shopping with her sister, or partying with the same group of people at London nightclubs, Middleton's good looks and sense of style earned her many fans, as well as critics. Dubbed the \"wisteria sisters,\" Kate and Middleton were criticized for what some perceived as social climbing. Seen out and about frequently, Middleton became a paparazzi favorite.\n\nRoyal Wedding\n\nThe November 2010 announcement of the engagement of Prince William and Kate caused a national frenzy in Britain. Always close to her sister, Middleton reportedly helped Kate plan many of the details of the royal wedding and the reception.\n\nBridesmaid Dress\n\nWhen the much-anticipated wedding took place at Westminster Abbey on April 29, 2011, many eyes were on the bride's younger sister \u2014 and Middleton, as the maid of honor, didn't disappoint. Dressed in a slinky white dress by Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen, Middleton held her sister's train and chatted with Prince Harry during the televised ceremony. Her beau, stockbroker and former cricketer Alex Loudon, sat beside her in the front row at the ceremony. The rave reviews of Middleton's dress \u2014 and her figure \u2014 rivaled the enthusiasm for the bride's gown.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nMiddleton has been romantically linked to George Percy, the son of the Duke of Northumberland, and J.J. Jardine Paterson, the son of a banking family. She dated hedge fund manager James Matthews in 2012. After their split, she dated banker Nico Jackson from 2013 to 2015.\n\nWhen Middleton and Jackson ended their relationship, she and Matthews began dating again. On July 17, 2016, Middleton and Matthews announced their engagement and plans to marry in 2017. Matthews is the son of Scottish nobleman David Matthews, the Laird of Glen Affric, an honorary title his son will inherit. When he acquires the title, Middleton will receive the title Lady Glen Affric.\n\nThe couple married on May 20, 2017, at St. Mark\u2019s Church in the village of Englefield, near Reading. Big sister, Prince William, Prince Harry and other notables like tennis star Roger Federer were in attendance. Her nephew and niece, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, were page boy and flower girl.\n\nIn April 2018, it was reported that Middleton and Matthews were expecting their first child. The mom-to-be confirmed the news in June with a column in the publication Waitrose Weekend, titled, \"Exercising during pregnancy.\"\n\nMiddleton and Matthews welcomed their first child, son Arthur, on October 15, 2018, and daughter, Grace, on March 15, 2021.\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nBirth Year: 1983\n\nBirth date: September 6, 1983\n\nBirth City: Reading, Berkshire, England\n\nBirth Country: United Kingdom\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: Pippa Middleton is best known as the younger sister of Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nAstrological Sign: Virgo\n\nSchools\n\nUniversity of Edinburgh\n\nFact Check\n\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,contact us!\n\nCITATION INFORMATION", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/victoria-beckham-attends-the-premiere-of-lola-at-regency-news-photo-1759783427.pjpeg?crop=0.421xw:0.303xh;0.300xw,0.0737xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/biography/static/images/logos/logo.5ec9b18.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/biography/static/images/logos/network-logo.04aa008.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1127820765.jpg?crop=1xw:1.0xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/william-shakespeare-royalty-free-illustration-1758286994.pjpeg?crop=0.843xw:1.00xh;0.0801xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/professor-stephen-hawking-british-theoretical-physicist-news-photo-1695324822.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.666xh;0,0.0967xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/sharing.89c15b8.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/william-shakespeare-royalty-free-illustration-1755952497.pjpeg?crop=0.847xw:1.00xh;0.0797xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/musician-ozzy-osbourne-signs-copies-of-his-album-patient-news-photo-1693587338.jpg?crop=0.616xw:0.917xh;0.274xw,0.0827xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/x.3361b6d.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/search.f1c199c.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/royal-family-prince-andrew-gettyimages-826418528.jpg?crop=0.716xw:1.00xh;0.101xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/charlie-hunnam-attends-the-2024-met-gala-celebrating-news-photo-1729104230.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.667xh;0,0.0741xh&resize=360:*", "https://www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/images/privacy/opt-out.66f7eeb.svg", "https://www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dr-jane-goodall-attends-the-time-100-summit-2019-on-april-news-photo-1759355118.pjpeg?crop=0.670xw:1.00xh;0.263xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/author-mary-shelley-writing-at-her-desk-news-photo-1759761556.pjpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.689xh;0,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/inkt-ep04-thumbnail-682dd7da2d33d.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lusaka-zambia-british-prime-minister-margaret-thatcher-and-news-photo-1676650750.jpg?crop=0.803xw:0.988xh;0.0801xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/owen-cooper-accepts-the-outstanding-supporting-actor-in-a-news-photo-1757950768.pjpeg?crop=0.651xw:0.875xh;0.0561xw,0.0517xh&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anna-wintour-1.jpg?crop=0.958xw:0.958xh;0.0293xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.biography.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/close.38e3324.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1127820765.jpg?crop=1xw:0.5xh;center,top&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1127820765.jpg?crop=1xw:0.5xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.biography.com/royalty/pippa-middleton", "title": "Husband, Age & Facts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Pippa Middleton -
