From Rosie O'Donnell's and Jordin Sparks' respective 50 pound weight losses to Biggest Loser winner Rachel Frederickson's whopping 155 lighter frame, see before and after pictures of celebrities' weight loss transformations.\n\n\u201cToday, I am down a total of 43 pounds! Only 7 more pounds until I\u2019ve shed the 50 my doctor told me to lose following the heart attack,\u201d the Weight Watchers ambassador, 47, captioned an Instagram pic on Wednesday, June 13, crediting magician Penn Jillette and Ray Cronise for kickstarting his weight loss, and Weight Watchers for helping him slim down. \u201cThis #wwambassador is now at the absolute thinnest I\u2019ve been since I finished high school! And while I may look a little better, I FEEL f\u2014king fantastic! It\u2019ll be a few weeks, but I\u2019m ready to lose that final 7 points! And when I hit my goal, I\u2019ll let you know where I started.\u201d\n\nSmith made headlines in February after revealing that he experienced a \u201cmassive\u201d heart attack backstage at an L.A. comedy show. He recently showed off his weight loss in May, telling his 1.2 million Instagram followers that he\u2019s lost 32 lbs since the traumatic experience.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Health Scares Trista Sutter, Selena Gomez, Ellen DeGeneres and more stars have opened up about their unexpected illnesses and injuries \u2014 read more\n\nThe filmmaker previously opened up about his weight loss journey exclusively to Us Weekly back in April.\n\n\u201cFor me, food was not like fuel. It wasn\u2019t, like, you eat food because it powers your body and you move on,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI\u2019m an American who grew up in the \u201870s when America figured out, if we start putting more sugar in everything, they\u2019ll buy it. So sugar starts showing up in the bread and everything.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u201990s Nostalgia Photos: Pictures of Boy Bands, Grunge, Throwback Moments From boy bands to Britney Spears to Beverly Hills, 90210, the 1990s were chock-full of decade-defining musical acts, TV shows, and personalities. See photos sure to induce some '90s nostalgia.\n\nSmith added that he didn\u2019t think he was having a heart attack when it happened, given that he lost 85 lbs three years ago after cutting sugar out of his diet entirely. \u201cI was sweaty, I thought I couldn\u2019t catch my breath, I felt nauseated, but I didn\u2019t think of those as heart attack symptoms,\u201d he explained. \u201cI couldn\u2019t piece it together, but that\u2019s me being incredibly stupid because my mom has two stents in her heart and my father died of a massive heart attack at 67.\u201d", "images":
