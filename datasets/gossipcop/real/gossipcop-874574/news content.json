Just recently, another former \u2018Hills cast member, Lauren Conrad welcomed her first child, a baby boy named Liam Tell. Now, at 31-weeks-pregnant, Heidi Montag is counting down the days until she gives birth to her son. Now, the longtime reality TV couple are closer than ever to becoming parents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too much for me!\u2026 I think I\u2019m just adjusting to the level of anxiety I\u2019m dealing with. This is terrifying.\u201d\n\nFor her first pregnancy, Heidi said she\u2019s feeling pretty good. The mom-to-be is trying to work out a little more by swimming.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling good. I\u2019m trying to work out a little bit more\u2026 swimming to flip the baby\u2019s position inside.\u201d\n\nSpencer and Heidi have finally chosen a name for their first born, but has chosen not to reveal the unique baby name just yet.\n\n\u201cWe have a name as of right now, so that\u2019s exciting\u2026 It\u2019s very original.\u201d\n\nThe former reality television stars decided on a name after much thought even though Spencer wanted something more extravagant, \u201cI definitely wanted Speidi. At least a middle name!\u201d\n\nThe baby\u2019s name is as Pratt said, \u201cNot as flashy as I would like.\u201d Heidi Montag added, \u201cWe came to a common ground.\u201d\n\nPotential play dates with The Hills co-stars and their little ones are more of a reality now that Whitney Port is now the proud mom to son Sonny Rosenman, Kristin Cavallari has three kids of her own and Audrina Patridge recently celebrated daughter Kirra Bohan\u2019s first birthday.\n\nHeidi and Spencer, who wed in 2008, recently returned from a babymoon in Hawaii where they celebrated Pratt\u2019s 34th birthday.\n\nSpencer joked about his son being marriage potential for Kristin Cavallari\u2019s little girl, Saylor Cutler, down the line.\n\n\u201cWe got NFL superstar [Jay Cutler], Kristin Cavallari. Go marry into that family, please. And Kristin hooked Heidi and I up, so it would make sense\u2026 Liam, Sonny. We got the whole squad. I\u2019m hoping they get their own series\u2014 The Hills Nickelodeon.\u201d\n\nKristin Cavallari, the 30-year-old is a mother to three: son Camden, 4, and Jaxon, 3, as well as daughter Saylor, 1, has had practice in the motherhood realm and gave her former co-stars some tips on parenting.\n\n\u201cWhen Audrina was pregnant, she reached out a lot and asked me some questions, like what pregnancy jeans I liked, and that kind of stuff\u2026 I\u2019ve talked to her since she\u2019s had the baby and she sounds like she\u2019s just loving life. For Heidi, I put together a little list of different products and toys that I\u2019ve loved and sent that over to her.\u201d\n\nA major piece of advice that Cavallari shared with Today was that with her three kids, she realized each child is different and every person in every family is different so it\u2019s important for parents to remain open-minded. Cavallari said at the end of the day a mom must do what she thinks is best for her child and trust \u201cyour gut feelings.\u201d\n\nSpencer Pratt and Heidi Montag are already joking about their future son marrying Kristin Cavallari\u2019s daughter. https://t.co/We48Xu0CaI pic.twitter.com/jpmdBwSQ9B \u2014 E! News (@enews) August 20, 2017\n\nMontag revealed to Us magazine that she\u2019s looking forward to watching their son develop his own interests whether they be Micky Mouse or ballerinas .\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited for his personality and his little smile\u2026 I\u2019m excited to take him to Disneyland and to see if he\u2019s into dinosaurs, Mickey Mouse or ballerinas \u2014 it can be anything. Maybe he\u2019ll be the best dancer!\u201d\n\n[Featured Image by Jerod Harris/Getty Images]", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2421769f-57a4-4bff-913f-cf316747493e.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20157'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20492%20142'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo-white.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/98ada80519ab60d3407c0587222ffb15?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent-Dark-Mode.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20120%20120'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/heidi-montag-and-spencer-pratt-talk-future-play-dates-with-the-hills-kids", "title": "Heidi Montag And Spencer Pratt Talk Future Play Dates With \u2018The Hills\u2019 Kids", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.png", "description": "Soon-to-be parents Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt are just a few short weeks away from welcoming their first baby.
