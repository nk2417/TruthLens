Fall is the favorite season of the nation, with 29% responding that they prefer an autumnal climate. A winter chill is only preferred by 7% of us.\n\nSummertime activities like swimming, sunbathing and outdoor sports may be why the solstice rates higher among younger than older people. While for the majority (30%) of 18-34 year old Americans summer is their favorite season, this is the case for just 20% of those aged 55 and over. 37% of 55s and older prefer spring above all \u2013 the perfect time of year for gardening and enjoying the warmer weather before the height of summer. The biggest proportion of winter fans was in the West and the South \u2013 where temperatures can reach over 100 degrees Fahrenheit in July \u2013 as 14% of westerners and 11% of southerners prefer cooler climes.", "images": ["https://dnc08nwcya6mg.cloudfront.net/original_images/ShareBtn-Bluesky.png", "https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/GettyImages-1063020944.original.jpg?pw=336", "https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/weatherchart2.format-webp.webp", "https://dnc08nwcya6mg.cloudfront.net/original_images/YG_Logo.png", "https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/GettyImages-2238300756.original.jpg?pw=336", "https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/congress-getty-images_.original.jpg?pw=336", "https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/weather.original.jpg?pw=1200", "https://d39be2hlyrutg8.cloudfront.net/static/favicon.ico", "https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/weatherchart3.format-webp.webp", "https://d39be2hlyrutg8.cloudfront.net/1fdb9afd/assets/images/svg/yougov-logo.svg", "https://dnc08nwcya6mg.cloudfront.net/original_images/Group.original.png", "https://dnc08nwcya6mg.cloudfront.net/original_images/rss.png", "https://dnc08nwcya6mg.cloudfront.net/original_images/Group_3.original.png", "https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/shutdown_GettyImages-2239211528_copy.original.jpg?pw=336", "https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/GettyImages-2240388025.original.jpg?pw=336", "https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/GettyImages-2238300792.original.jpg?pw=336", "https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/shutdown_GettyImages-2241005153_copy.original.jpg?pw=336", "https://dnc08nwcya6mg.cloudfront.net/original_images/twitter-x.png", "https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/GettyImages-2225189195.original.jpg?pw=336", "https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/GettyImages-1055691676.original.jpg?pw=336", "https://ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Weatherchart1.format-webp.webp"], "top_img": "https://d39be2hlyrutg8.cloudfront.net/static/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "YouGov", "meta_data": {"referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "noarchive"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1370836800.0, "source": "https://today.yougov.com", "summary": ""}
