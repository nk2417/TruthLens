I needed to let go,\u201d said Collins, 28, who plays a woman struggling with anorexia in her new film To The Bone.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always strived to start conversations about taboo subjects with young women \u2026 having suffered from an eating disorder does not define me, I\u2019m not ashamed of my past.\u201d\n\nAdam Franzino/SHAPE\n\nThe self-described \u201cclean eater\u201d now has a healthy relationship with food. \u201cI love chicken, fish and vegetables and grains like quinoa, but I don\u2019t eat red meat.\u201d she said. She also shuns processed foods. \u201cI\u2019m very farm-to-table; growing up in the English countryside it was a way of life, not a trend.\u201d\n\nNot that Collins deprives herself entirely. She\u2019ll have \u201cthe occasional dessert\u201d when out with friends.\n\n\u201cWhen I splurge, it\u2019s usually on things I\u2019ve baked, because it\u2019s satisfying physically and emotionally,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019m not gluten-free or vegan, but I love baking things because of the sense of accomplishment I get from creating something that\u2019s yummy and healthy.\u201d\n\nWhile the star can be known to whip up \u201ceverything from doughnuts to birthday cakes and banana-walnut bread,\u201d she does admit, \u201cthere was a time when I wouldn\u2019t let myself taste those foods, let alone make them.\u201d\n\nAdam Franzino/SHAPE\n\nNow, the star takes pride in her shape.\n\nFROM PEN: This Is Us\u2019 Chrissy Metz on Finding Happiness After Years of Dieting and Depression\n\n\u201cI used to see healthy as this image of what I thought perfect looked like \u2014 the perfect muscle definition, etc,\u201d said Collins. \u201cBut healthy now is how strong I feel. It\u2019s a beautiful change, because if you\u2019re strong and confident, it doesn\u2019t matter what muscles are showing. Today I love my shape. My body is the shape it is because it holds my heart.\u201d\n\nAdam Franzino/SHAPE\n\nExercise also plays a big part in keeping her body and mind strong.\n\n\u201cI try to be active in some way everyday: It\u2019s my time to disappear and be in my own world,\u201d said Collins, who loves swimming and counts Body by Simone as her favorite workout. \u201d I can also push myself past what I thought I was capable of.\u201d\n\nAdam Franzino/SHAPE\n\nAnd Collins doesn\u2019t sweat it if she doesn\u2019t make it to the gym.\n\n\u201cOf course, if I\u2019m traveling or tired I give my body a rest,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to feel guilty if I skipped a workout in the past, but now it just means life is offering up things that I want to do instead. Those ellipticals will always be there but experiences won\u2019t.\u201d", "images":
