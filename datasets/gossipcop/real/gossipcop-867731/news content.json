We made a bunch of money, we won a Grammy, album was triple platinum. I had motorcycles and cars. I called the Gucci store in Atlanta, and I was like, \u2018Hey, will y\u2019all close it down if I bring my friends?\u2019 And I\u2019m smiling but that\u2019s stupid.\u201d\n\nJim Spellman/WireImage\n\n\u201cWe released our next album and it was, like, a flop,\u201d Smith said. \u201cIt was a tragedy, it went, like, double plastic. I had spent all my money and I didn\u2019t forget but I didn\u2019t pay the IRS. In my mind, I wasn\u2019t trying to avoid taxes, I was just like \u2018Ah, damn, they need their money.'\u201d\n\nSmith continued, \u201cThe IRS took all that stuff, so I was like, broke, broke, broke. Being famous and broke is a s\u2014 combination because you\u2019re still famous and [people] recognize you but they recognize you while you sitting next to them on the bus.\u201d\n\nThe Suicide Squad star recalled his then-girlfriend urging him to pay a visit to the Arsenio Hall Show and told him to hang out and try to meet with other creators in Hollywood in an attempt to turn his career around.\n\n\u201cI went to the Arsenio Hall Show and I met a dude named Benny Medina. Benny Medina is the real-life Fresh Prince of Bel Air,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI met Benny and he pitches me the idea for this show, and I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m not an actor.\u2019\u201d\n\nDespite his doubts about acting, Medina introduced Smith to Quincy Jones, who was producing the show with him. In December 1989, Smith went to Jones\u2019 home where he was surrounded by artists, describing the party as something out of The Wiz.\n\n\u201c[Jones] said, \u2018Hey, man, I saw your music videos, I love you what\u2019re doing, I love what you\u2019re doing. Tell me what your rap name was again?'\u201d\n\nChris Haston/NBCU Photo Bank\n\nSmith said, \u201cThey call me the Fresh Prince,\u201d to which Jones said, \u201c\u2018All right, good, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll call the show.\u2019 And he handed me a screenplay for A Failed Morris Day Pilot.\u201d\n\nJones asked Smith to study the script for a few minutes before having him audition, but the Men in Black actor protested saying he wasn\u2019t ready to audition for the part.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jada Pinkett Smith Had \u2018No Idea\u2019 Daughter Willow Walked in on Her Parents Having Sex\n\nThe legendary music producer acquiesced, saying Smith could meet him in two weeks for an audition or he \u201ccould take 10 minutes right now and you could change your life forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like f\u2014 it then. I said yes and I let it rip and I got to the end and everyone\u2019s clapping,\u201d Smith said of his impromptu audition.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Quincy is like popping up at the windows going like, \u2018No paralysis, do analysis! No paralysis, do analysis!\u2019 Like how did he make Thriller like this?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe took a picture and we signed the basic deal for Fresh Prince and three months later we were shooting the pilot and that\u2019s the story of how I became the Prince of Bel Air,\u201d Smith recalled.\n\nHe added, \u201cThe moral of the story is always say yes and I guess listen to your girlfriend.\u201d",
