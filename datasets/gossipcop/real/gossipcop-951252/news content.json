We\u2019re having the baby and we\u2019re doing it next month.\u2019 And then the next, I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s wait a year.\u2019 It\u2019s hard because I want them to be close in age and at the same time, maybe I need a little more time in between.\u201d\n\nFellow Hills alum Kristin Cavallari is a proponent of having kids back-to-back. \u201cI talked to Kristin about it and she\u2019s like, \u2018Just knock \u2018em out!\u201d Heidi said.
