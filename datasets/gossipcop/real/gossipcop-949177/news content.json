He was 59.\n\nA spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner tells PEOPLE Craig was pronounced dead at 12:38 p.m. after being found dead in his Studio City, California, home from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Tuesday.\n\nHis autopsy is pending. A rep for Tina did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nCraig is the son of Tina \u2014 who was just 18 when she gave birth to him \u2014 and saxophonist Raymond Hill, who performed with Ike Turner\u2019s band Kings of Rhythm. Craig was adopted by Ike after he and Tina married in 1962.\n\nCraig worked as a real estate agent in California, according to The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nCraig Turner/Facebook\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: Warning Signs to Look for If You Are Concerned Someone Is Suicidal\n\nJust hours before her son took his own life, Tina attended Giorgio Armani Priv\u00e9 Haute Couture fashion show in Paris, France, as part of the Haute Couture Paris Fashion Week.\n\nThe iconic singer has lived in Europe since 1995 with her German record-executive husband Erwin Bach. In 2013, she relinquished her American citizenship.\n\nTina has been open about the abuse she suffered at the hands of Craig\u2019s adoptive father, Ike, who died in 2007.\n\nIn May 2005, Tina revealed to Oprah that it particularly took a toll on Craig, who \u201cwas a very emotional kid.\u201d\n\nStephane Cardinale/Corbis via Getty\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d always look down in sadness,\u201d she said of her son\u2019s response to her abuse. \u201cOne day when Ike was fighting me, Craig knocked on the door and said, \u2018Mother, are you all right?\u2019 I thought, \u2018Oh, please, don\u2019t beat me at home.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want my children to hear.\u201d\n\nThe singer recently launched a musical based on her life, Tina, in London \u2014 which details every turbulent moment of her 50-year singing career.\n\nTMZ was first to report the news of Craig\u2019s tragic death.\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline
