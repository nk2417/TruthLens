The movie, which reunites key cast members from the original 2003 film, will air on Red Nose Day in May.\n\nThe Red Nose Day Actually clip opens with scenes from the first film before introducing what\u2019s currently happening in the characters\u2019 lives. Several scenes echo moments from the original movie, including the famous cue card scene. This time around Andrew Lincoln\u2018s character queries Keira Knightley\u2018s character about his beard (she isn\u2019t a fan). Meanwhile, Hugh Grant reprises his dance moves, though now he\u2019s a little worse for wear, and Bill Nighy\u2019s character boasts he\u2019s had sex with a Kardashian, but he can\u2019t recall which one.\n\nLiam Neeson, Laura Linney, Colin Firth and Rowan Atkinson also star in the trailer and new sequel made by the original film\u2019s writer-director Richard Curtis.\n\nTrending Stories Kevin Spacey Says He Has 'No Home' After Sexual Misconduct Allegations 2025 CMA Awards: The Complete Winners List \u2018Faith Is Under Attack': Nicki Minaj Spreads Misleading Information at the United Nations Neighbor Indicted in Murder of \u2018King of the Hill\u2019 Star Jonathan Joss\n\nThe sequel first aired in the U.K. in March to coincide with its Red Nose Day.
