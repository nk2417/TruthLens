Franco stars in the show but also directed several episodes and serves as one of its producers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still reading it the same as everyone else, trying to discern what is or isn\u2019t there,\u201d Simon told Variety in a statement. \u201cPersonally I can only speak knowledgeably to \u2018The Deuce.\u2019 I\u2019ve checked with all my fellow producers and other personnel. We have no complainant or complaint or any awareness of any incident of concern involving Mr. Franco. Nor has HBO been approached with any complaint.\n\nSimon concluded: \u201cIn our experience, he was entirely professional as an actor, director, and producer.\u201d\n\nThe Los Angeles Times published a report on January 11 in which five women went on record accusing Franco of sexually inappropriate and exploitative behavior. Four of the accusers are Franco\u2019s former acting students. The majority of the accusations allege Franco pressured women into appearing nude on film sets.\n\n\u201cI feel there was an abuse of power, and there was a culture of exploiting non-celebrity women, and a culture of women being replaceable,\u201d Sarah Tither-Kaplan told the Times about Franco\u2019s set.\n\nTither-Kaplan was acting in Franco\u2019s film \u201cThe Long Home\u201d when she was asked by a producer to appear in a \u201cbonus scene\u201d that included a simulated orgy. The actress agreed to appear fully nude in the background of the scene, but she says she observed Franco allegedly remove clear plastic guards that covered actresses\u2019 vaginas \u201cto simulate the sex act with no protection.\u201d\n\nAnother woman, Violet Paley, says Franco pressured her into performing oral sex on him while sitting in her car in 2016. The two had been in a consensual romantic relationship at the time.\n\n\u201cI was talking to him, all of a sudden his penis was out,\u201d said Paley. \u201cI got really nervous, and I said, \u2018Can we do this later?\u2019 He was kind of nudging my head down, and I just didn\u2019t want him to hate me, so I did it.\u201d\n\nFranco has said during appearances on both \u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert\u201d and \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers\u201d that the allegations against him are \u201cnot accurate.\u201d The actor told Seth Meyers that he wasn\u2019t going to \u201cactively refute\u201d the accusations since he felt every woman should be able to share her story.\n\n\u201cThe Deuce,\u201d in which Franco stars opposite Maggie Gyllenhaal, wrapped up its debut season in October 27 and has been renewed for a second season.", "images": ["https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/caitlin-clark-wnbpa-panini.png?resize=232,175",
