Soules proposed to fertility nurse Whitney Bischoff in the finale of his show; they split about six months later. Soules also appeared on Dancing With the Stars in 2015.\n\nAn Iowa farmer in Buchanan County when not on TV, Soules struck a tractor driven by a neighbor on April 24 last year in northern Iowa, sending it into a ditch. He called 911 and waited for first responders, but left before police arrived. He was charged with felony hit and run when the tractor driver died at a local hospital. Court documents claimed alcoholic beverages or containers were found at the scene of the crash.\n\nThe Iowa State Patrol said Soules fled on foot after the 8:20 PM wreck, which occurred about 15 miles south of Soules\u2019 farm in Arlington.\n\nSoules contended Iowa law doesn\u2019t require fatal wreck surviving drivers to wait for police. But state prosecutors say it does. Soules previously asked a judge to dismiss the case but the judge declined last month and Soules appealed.\n\nThe Class D felony carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $7,000 fine.", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/chris-soules-mug-sho-and-bachelor-2-shot.jpg?w=628&h=383&crop=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/chris-soules-mug-sho-and-bachelor-2-shot.jpg?w=628", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/chris-soules-mug-sho-and-bachelor-2-shot.jpg?w=628", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bruce Haring", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/02/the-bachelor-star-chris-soules-denied-appeal-on-fatal-iowa-accident-will-stand-trial-1202301794/", "title": "\u2018The Bachelor\u2019 Star Chris Soules Denied Appeal On Fatal Iowa Accident", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The Iowa Supreme Court won't hear an appeal by 'The Bachelor' star Chris Soules on leaving a fatal accident.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Bruce Haring", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018The Bachelor\u2019 Star Chris Soules Denied Appeal On Fatal Iowa Accident", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/02/the-bachelor-star-chris-soules-denied-appeal-on-fatal-iowa-accident-will-stand-trial-1202301794/", "description": "The Iowa Supreme Court won't hear an appeal by 'The Bachelor' star Chris Soules on leaving a fatal accident.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/chris-soules-mug-sho-and-bachelor-2-shot.jpg?w=628", "width": 628, "height": 422, "alt": "Chris Soules"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-24T02:40:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-24T16:20:42+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The Iowa Supreme Court won't hear an appeal by 'The Bachelor' star Chris Soules on leaving a fatal accident.", "site": "@Deadline", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018The Bachelor\u2019 Star Chris Soules Denied Appeal On Fatal Iowa Accident", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/chris-soules-mug-sho-and-bachelor-2-shot.jpg?w=628"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519440001.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
