The Uncommon James founder stopped by Us Weekly\u2019s \u201cWatch With Us\u201d podcast on Monday, July 2, ahead of the premiere of her new reality show, Very Cavallari. It\u2019s been eight years since Cavallari has been on reality TV \u2013 she starred on Laguna Beach from 2004 to 2006 then joined The Hills from 2009 to 2010.\n\nRelated: The Hills Stars: Then and Now The rest may still be unwritten, but since 'The Hills' went off the air in 2010, the reality show's stars have gone on to become best-selling authors, clothing designers, chefs, musicians, and more. See where your 'Hills' favorites, including Lauren Conrad, Heidi Montag, and Audrina Patridge ended up!\n\nHowever, her life has completely changed since then. Now 31, she\u2019s married to former NFL star Jay Cutler and they have three children. For years, Cavallari has been pitched reality TV shows, but this one had something the others didn\u2019t: she got to be an executive producer, a deal breaker for her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different when you\u2019re 18 or 20 and it\u2019s just you. But I have three kids. I\u2019m a wife. It\u2019s not just me anymore that I have to be responsible for and look out for,\u201d she told Us. \u201cSo I have that security blanket just knowing I\u2019m going to see everything beforehand, I can get things taken out if I want to. In that same breath, I want to make a good show. I know that I have to leave some stuff in there that maybe personally is not my best moment, but I know that it\u2019s good TV. As a producer, I\u2019ve had to battle that a little bit.\u201d\n\nRelated: From \u2018Laguna Beach\u2019 to \u2018The Hills\u2019: Relive Kristin Cavallari\u2019s Most Memorable Moments in Reality TV From reality star villain \u2026 to reality star powerhouse! Kristin Cavallari is returning to TV with a new reality show, Very Cavallari, looking inside her life as a boss, business woman and wife to NFL star Jay Cutler. In honor of the event, Us Weekly is looking back at some of her most iconic moments [\u2026]\n\nWhile the show is good TV, it\u2019s not about the drama. \u201cThis is not the kind of show that we\u2019re flipping tables. I didn\u2019t want to do a show like that,\u201d she said, adding that it will feature Cutler, despite him not wanting to do it. \u201cHe never thought he would be doing a reality show, and he really wants no part of it but he\u2019s doing it because he supports me of course.\u201d\n\nCutler has also never seen The Hills or Laguna Beach, Cavallari noted, but if he did \u2013 or if her kids do when they are old enough, she wouldn\u2019t really mind, since she was a kid then.\n\nRelated: Stars Who Got Their Start on Reality TV The road to success in Hollywood is a little different for every would-be actor, but these days, reality TV is becoming a major launching pad for some of the industry's biggest stars. Before they were red-carpet regulars, NeNe Leakes, Jennifer Hudson, Julianne Hough and Lucy Hale were among those who broke through as reality stars\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so innocent compared to what\u2019s on TV now. I\u2019m like, \u2018God, we weren\u2019t doing anything,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201c[I was] 17 years old with a red solo cup! Then all of a sudden, I\u2019m like \u2018Woo!\u2019 We were so innocent then. Simpler times.\u201d\n\nCavallari was painted as the villain on both MTV classic shows, and even admitted that people are shocked when they meet her and she\u2019s nice. \u201cI\u2019m excited for people to see me!\u201d As for advice she\u2019d give her teen self before Laguna Beach began, it would be simple: \u201cJust calm down. I was so nervous, I started spouting away. If I wasn\u2019t so nervous, I probably would have come out looking a little bit better.\u201d\n\nCavallari\u2019s ex and former costar Stephen Colletti recently stopped by the podcast and answered the question a bit differently \u2013 he\u2019d tell himself not to drink so much on that now infamous Cabo trip. \u201cThat\u2019s good advice, Stephen. I concur,\u201d Cavallari said about his answer. \u201cYou and me both, but you especially!\u201d\n\nVery Cavallari premieres on E!
