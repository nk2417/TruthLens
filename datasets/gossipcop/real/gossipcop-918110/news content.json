His director and animator Glen Keane thanked Bryant for helping write their award-winning short film.\n\nKevin Winter/Getty\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a message for all of us,\u201d Keane said in his acceptance speech. \u201cWhatever form your dream may take, it\u2019s through passion and perseverance that it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nBryant chimed in, \u201cWell I don\u2019t know if anything is possible. As a basketball player we\u2019re really supposed to shut up and dribble.\u201d\n\nBe sure to check out PEOPLE\u2019s full Academy Awards coverage to get the latest news on Hollywood\u2019s big night.\n\nFox News anchor Laura Ingraham used the phrase \u201cshut up and dribble\u201d last month when she told Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James to stop commenting on politics.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: We Are Counting Down the Best Moments Between LeBron James and Kobe Bryant\n\nBryant went on to thank composer John Williams, his wife Vanessa and their three daughters Natalia, 15, Gianna, 11, and Bianka, 14 months.\n\n\u201c\u2018I feel better than winning the championship,\u201d Bryant told reporters following his victory. \u201cI swear. Growing up as a kid, I dreamt of winning championships and worked really hard. But then to have something like this come out of left field. I heard a lot of people tell me, \u2018What are you going to do when you retire?\u2019 I want to be a writer and a storyteller. I got a lot of, \u2018That\u2019s cute.\u2019 I got that a lot. To be here right now and have a sense of validation, this is crazy.\u201d\n\nThe former guard, who said he\u2019s working on five novels, also explained why he decided to get political on the Oscars stage. \u201cFor us, not just as athletes, but as people in general, we have the ability to speak up for what it is that we believe in; whether you\u2019re an athlete or not, whether you\u2019re an actor or not,\u201d Bryant continued in the press room. \u201cWe have the ability to speak up as well as people have a right to criticize. It\u2019s the democracy that we live in. That\u2019s what makes America beautiful.\u201d\n\nJames appreciated the act of solidarity. \u201cSalute @kobebryant on that Oscar!!\u201d the Cavaliers forward, 33, tweeted Sunday. \u201c#WeAreMoreThanShutUpDribble #UJustContinueToSitBackAndWatch\u201c\n\nFellow NBA alum Earvin \u201cMagic\u201d Johnson also showed his support for Bryant.\n\n\u201cCongratulations to my good friend @kobebryant for winning the Oscar for best animated short film,\u201d Johnson, 58, tweeted. \u201cWell deserved!\u201d\n\nThe 2018 Oscars were held at the Dolby Theatre at Hollywood & Highland Center on March 4 and were telecast live on ABC.", "images":
