Try adopting a more mindful approach to dressing by building your own capsule collection.\n\nWhat to Read Next\n\nRaimonda Kulikauskiene // Getty Images\n\nAttitudes to fashion and shopping have changed dramatically over the years. Instead of being swayed by passing trends and one-hit wonders, many of us are now trying to take more of a considered approach to what we buy and how we shop. With sustainability increasingly at the forefront of conversation, there has been a shift in focus to quality over quantity, adopting a curated edit and investing in pieces that will stand the test of time.\n\nIf you would like to embrace a more considered approach to fashion, but feel that you need a little help on where to start, read on.\n\nWhat is a capsule wardrobe?\n\nWhen a wardrobe is considered 'capsule', it tends to mean a streamlined edit of items that all work well together. This helps to ensure that nothing goes unused. Traditionally, a capsule wardrobe sticks to neutral hues so that everything coordinates (but this doesn't have to be the case), and is made up of around 10 to 20 pieces such as staple jeans, the perfect white T-shirt, a classic trench coat, a crisp blazer, dresses that can be styled up or down, and comfortable knitwear. With that said, a capsule wardrobe will look different to everyone \u2013 ultimately, it should be comprised of pieces that work for your lifestyle, that make you feel good, and that you love.\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe all have those same few pieces that we wear on repeat, regardless of how many clothes we have in our closet, and we need to be encouraged to build from that,\u201d fashion commentator and writer Aleska Servian tells us.\n\nInstead of trying to create a wardrobe of what we think is a capsule classic, we should build around those pieces that we already wear to death. We don't all have the same job, lifestyle or live in the same climate, so a capsule wardrobe should be a considered edit of pieces that you can rely on all the time, and that work together for you. It won't look the same for everyone.\n\n\n\nWhere do I start in building a capsule wardrobe?\n\nFirst off, you definitely do not need to clear everything in your wardrobe out and start from scratch. Curating a capsule wardrobe is about working out what you wear a lot, and want to keep, and identifying anything that is missing.\n\n\"There\u2019s no need to toss everything to start over from scratch if you don\u2019t have to,\" Lakyn Carlton, a personal stylist and sustainability expert, explains. \"Evaluate your wardrobe and pull out the things you already wear, create new combinations from the old, and then if you absolutely need to add something, figure out what that is.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut, if your wardrobe is overflowing and out of control, it can be daunting to know where to begin. Fanny Moizant, president and co-founder of the pre-loved designer site , advises us on how to detox our wardrobes in a smart, effective way.\n\nRachpoot/Bauer-Griffin // Getty Images\n\n\u201cYou need to give yourself a couple of hours and commit. Start by splitting up your wardrobe by season,\u201d she notes . \u201cClear out the previous season so you can focus on what you'll be wearing for the next few months, and then ask yourself these questions: 'Is the item something you still wear? Is it a timeless classic? Does it still fit you?'\u201d\n\nWhat if you\u2019re unsure about an item? Moizant relies on the 'hanger trick' when she\u2019s clearing out her own wardrobe so that it feels fresh and under control. \u201cAt the beginning of the season, place all your hangers in the same direction,\u201d she tells us. \u201cEach time you wear a piece, turn the hanger the other way. Very quickly within the season, you\u2019ll see what you wear and what you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIt is also important not to be totally unrealistic in thinking that you will never purchase anything again. Allow yourself the opportunity to buy a new item every now and then \u2013 just try to be mindful about what you are purchasing and how much you will realistically wear it.\n\n\"Don\u2019t buy an item just because it looks great on someone you admire or follow on Instagram,\" says Charlotte Warburton, founder of capsule-wardrobe brand TBC (To Be Created). \"Really think about your shape and size and whether their lifestyle relates to yours before you let yourself be influenced by someone else.\"\n\nHow to identify what you're missing\n\nWhen re-evaluating your wardrobe, try to identify the areas that need a little work so you can make the most of the pieces you already own.\n\nPerhaps you love to make a statement with the clothes you wear, and have a wardrobe filled with bold pieces, but you feel that you're not getting enough wear out of them day-to-day. If you have more staple pieces \u2013 such as T-shirts, a good pair of jeans and trans-seasonal boots \u2013 these more statement-making pieces can be dressed down, and ultimately made more wearable.\n\nChristian Vierig // Getty Images\n\nThe same rule applies if you\u2019re a minimalist. You might need to invest in some stand-out pieces like jewellery or a great coat that will give your neutral items a new lease of life. Consider how to style what is already loved in your wardrobe, and only invest in something new if it is going to help you to wear these more.\n\nCan I wear trend-led pieces and keep a capsule wardrobe?\n\nA capsule wardrobe is supposed to represent you and your personal style. And, for many of us, it is not realistic to never be tempted by trends. Sometimes, we want to experiment with something that feels fun and fresh to wear, and it's hard to deny the thrill of that feeling of newness. But, purchasing these pieces \u2013 those which may not stand the test of time, and may quickly feel dated \u2013 definitely does not align with the idea of a capsule wardrobe.\n\nEdward Berthelot // Getty Images\n\nThis is where resale and rental services can come in handy. Renting rather than buying for a special occasion will give you that feeling of newness, without impacting your carefully curated edit. For interchangeable pieces like bags, shoes and jewellery, renting is a great way to add something new to your ensembles at a fraction of the price. It's also a great way to experiment, and figure out whether or not a certain item should belong in your permanent collection. If you wear something and really love it, you could consider investing in one for good. Likewise, if you did purchase something that you no longer think you'll wear, consider reselling so that someone else can give it a second life.", "images":
