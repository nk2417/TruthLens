The Broadway legend went off on Madge during Tuesday\u2019s (May 9) episode of Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, where she made it clear she doesn\u2019t care for Mad\u2019s singing, acting, or anything else, really.\n\nExplore Madonna Patti LuPone See latest videos, charts and news\n\nThe American Theater Hall of Famer took particular issue with Madonna\u2019s portrayal of Argentina\u2019s Eva Peron in the 1996 movie musical Evita, a role LuPone originated on Broadway in 1979. \u201cI thought it was a piece of s\u2013t,\u201d she told host Cohen. \u201cMadonna is a movie killer.\u201d\n\nThat hurt, but LuPone was not nearly done. \u201cShe\u2019s dead behind the eyes. She couldn\u2019t act her way out of a paper bag. She should not be on film or on stage. She\u2019s a wonderful performer for what she does, but she is not an actress.\u201d\n\nThe two-time Grammy and Tony Award winner went after Madonna when a caller asked if the two had ever spoken about their shared performances as the late First Lady of Argentina. She explained that she was performing in Anything Goes while Madonna was making her Broadway debut in David Mamet\u2019s Speed the Plow in 1988 when a press agent put a sign up that said \u201cthere was only one diva allowed\u201d in the theater at a time.\n\nLuPone got a snicker out of that, but quickly followed up by saying that the only words Madonna has ever spoken to her were: \u201cI\u2019m taller than you.\u201d A spokesperson for Madonna could not be reached for comment.\n\nWatch the video below:", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/patti-lupone-wwhl-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=628&crop=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/patti-lupone-wwhl-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/patti-lupone-wwhl-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gil Kaufman", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/patti-lupone-disses-madonna-watch-what-happens-live-video-7792083/", "title": "Patti LuPone Says Madonna \u2018Should Not Be on Film or on Stage\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Patti LuPone went off on Madonna on Wednesday's (May 10) episode of &quot;Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,&quot; making it clear she's not a fan.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Gil Kaufman", "tags": "broadway", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Patti LuPone Says Madonna \u2018Should Not Be on Film or on Stage\u2019", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/patti-lupone-disses-madonna-watch-what-happens-live-video-7792083/", "description": "Patti LuPone went off on Madonna on Wednesday's (May 10) episode of \"Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,\" making it clear she's not a fan. \"I thought it was a piece of s--t,\" she said of Madonna's role as the lead in \"Evita,\" a role LuPone originated in the 1979 Broadway production.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/patti-lupone-wwhl-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Patti LuPone on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-10T15:57:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-05-10T15:57:15+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Patti LuPone went off on Madonna on Wednesday's (May 10) episode of \"Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,\" making it clear she's not a fan. \"I thought it was a piece of s--t,\" she said of Madonna's role as the lead in \"Evita,\" a role LuPone originated in the 1979 Broadway production.", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Patti LuPone Says Madonna \u2018Should Not Be on Film or on Stage\u2019", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/patti-lupone-wwhl-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494431835.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
