It serves grades nine through twelve in general and special education. East High School was founded in 1913[3] and currently has an enrolled student body of around 1,900. It is located at 840 South 1300 East in the East Bench neighborhood. The original building was completed in 1913, and the current structure was built in 1997.[3]\n\nMost of the Disney Channel film High School Musical was filmed at East High School. The opening scenes of its first sequel High School Musical 2 (including the film's opening number, \"What Time Is It?\") were also filmed at East High. Additional filming took place in St. George. The filming of the second sequel High School Musical 3: Senior Year began at East High on May 3, 2008. High School Musical: The Musical: The Series was also filmed at East High School.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nIn 1972, a fire destroyed the interior of the main building.[4]\n\nIn 2017, the school re-purposed two locker rooms below the gymnasium and installed washing machines in order to accommodate homeless students.[5] The non-profit organization Chapman-Richards Cares donated two washing machines and two dryers to the school. About 100 students at the time were homeless.[6]\n\nIn July 2017, a flood caused about $3 million in damages to the school.[7]\n\nHigh School Musical [ edit ]\n\nMuch of the Disney Channel film High School Musical and parts of its two sequels, High School Musical 2 and High School Musical 3: Senior Year, were filmed at East High. As a result, the school has become a destination for some tourists. In the summer of 2007, the school received 40 to 50 visitors per day who wanted to visit the location of the film.[8]\n\nIn November 2007, the school staged its own production of High School Musical.[8] Demand for tickets was so strong that the school added an extra performance.[9]\n\nThe school is the setting of the Disney+ show, High School Musical: The Musical: The Series.[10]\n\nThe exterior grounds of the school were used in the 1991 film Dream Machine.[citation needed]\n\nPanoramic view of East High School in August 2016\n\nNotable alumni [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nOfficial website", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cd/East_High_School%2C_Salt_Lake_City%2C_Utah.jpg/1000px-East_High_School%2C_Salt_Lake_City%2C_Utah.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Open_Access_logo_PLoS_transparent.svg/20px-Open_Access_logo_PLoS_transparent.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://maps.wikimedia.org/img/osm-intl,13,a,a,270x200.png?lang=en&domain=en.wikipedia.org&title=East_High_School_%28Utah%29&revid=1322181131&groups=_6652582c050851f018633c882da800fab0bb3aae", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Salt_Lake_City_East_High_School_3.jpg/1200px-Salt_Lake_City_East_High_School_3.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/40px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Salt_Lake_City_East_High_School_3.jpg/330px-Salt_Lake_City_East_High_School_3.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Salt_Lake_City_East_High_School_3.jpg/1200px-Salt_Lake_City_East_High_School_3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_High_School_(Utah)", "title": "East High School (Utah)", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.3", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8b/Salt_Lake_City_East_High_School_3.jpg/1200px-Salt_Lake_City_East_High_School_3.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 900}, "title": "East High School (Utah) - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
