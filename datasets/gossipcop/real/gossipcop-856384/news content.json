I love them both.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd does Nas like both of them the same as well?\u201d DeGeneres asked.\n\n\n\nSmooth, Ellen. So smooth.\n\nSponsored\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a rumor y\u2019all are dating, and if it\u2019s true, I\u2019m all for it. I love him so much\u2014ever since \u2018One Mic.\u2019 That\u2019s where I first found him,\u201d DeGeneres said. \u201cHe\u2019s fantastic and a really good guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so dope,\u201d Minaj responded. \u201cHe\u2019s the king. He is the king of Queens, and I\u2019d like to think I\u2019m the queen of Queens. I have a lot of respect for him. And, you know, he\u2019s kind of cute, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut have you had sleepovers yet, or is it just ... ?\u201d DeGeneres asked.\n\n\u201cWe have. Yup,\u201d Minaj said. \u201cI go to him. I just thought him coming to me was too forward. We didn\u2019t do the ... ,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cNasty?\u201d DeGeneres asked.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d Minaj replied.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just chillin\u2019 right now. I\u2019m celibate. I wanted to go a year without dating any man. I hate men,\u201d Minaj said. \u201cI might make an exception to the rule for him, because he\u2019s so dope.\u201d\n\nWell, there you have it. A two-for-one. New boyfriend.
