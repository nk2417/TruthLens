Hemsworth needed a place to live, so he unknowingly purchased the Malibu home Cyrus had used to record her first album.\n\n\u201cThe person [selling the house] hid all the plaques in the garage so he would still buy the house,\u201d Cyrus explained, according to E! News. \u201cSo then he went to move in and he was like \u2018F\u2014, I cannot get away, this b\u2014- is all over my f\u2014ing house!\u201d\n\nNow, the two live in the house together, and Cyrus even wrote her song \u201cMalibu\u201d about the space. The singer said Hemsworth is \u201cthe most normal NORMAL part of my life.\u201d\n\nOn the VMAs\n\nCyrus famously caused controversy at the 2013 show when she performed with Robin Thicke, gyrating on the singer while wearing a nude latex ensemble and a foam finger. Cyrus explained that the performance showed her own power, which she utilized the next year when she brought a homeless teen to the show.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t like it because I thought I had done something that was gonna make everyone talk about me. That\u2019s not why I liked it,\u201d she explained. \u201cThe reason why that\u2019s the best thing that\u2019s ever happened to me in my life is that\u2019s when I realized my power. I brought a young homeless teen because I realized my f\u2014ing power there.\u201d\n\nOn Drugs\n\nCyrus famously flaunted her marijuana use over recent years, but she recently revealed that she quit smoking weed. When asked by Stern why she made the decision, Cyrus replied, \u201cThis record means so much to me and I want to be able to tell people what I feel about the record in a non-stoned way.\u201d\n\nDuring a June appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Cyrus further elaborated on her point.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually the most passionate about what I\u2019m doing with this record than I\u2019ve been \u2014 I say this every time, but I loved making this record so, so much,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd this record at this moment is the most important album that I\u2019ve ever made. So I wanted to make sure that I was super clear in the way I\u2019m talking.\u201d\n\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock.com", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/boston-blue-faith-and-family-sonequa-martin-green-donnie-wahlberg-cbs.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/04/70839b1d-3826-4242-9848-ca2fff9b687f.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/04/45511bc5-8791-4d0b-a2e9-34e9c9011b24.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/70afec6a-3143-4947-b047-428e525611d4.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hannah Barnes", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/miley-cyrus-howard-stern-interview-vmas-liam-hemsworth/", "title": "The Most Fascinating Facts From Miley Cyrus\u2019 Interview With Howard Stern", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Most Fascinating Facts From Miley Cyrus' Interview With Howard Stern", "description": "Miley Cyrus isn\u2019t one to hold back when sharing stories, so it\u2019s no surprise that the singer\u2019s new interview on The Howard Stern Show covered a wide range of topics, including her fianc\u00e9, Liam Hemsworth, the MTV VMAs, her new music and marijuana use.
