A day after Harry, 33, and Markle, 36, announced their engagement, palace officials have started to stoke the media engines. The wedding will take place in St George's Chapel, palace officials said in a statement, adding that the royal family will foot the bill.\n\nPalace officials also said that Markle will be baptized in the Church of England prior to the wedding. She will also start the process of becoming a British citizen prior to the marriage \u2014 a process that involves her applying for a spousal visa and could take several years.\n\nHannah Jewell, our own British-American pop culture host, explains Prince Harry's engagement to Meghan Markle. (Video: David Jorgenson/The Washington Post)\n\nStill, many questions remain: What specific day in May will they wed? What title will Markle take after the marriage? Who will be on the guest list? Will there be a sea of dazzling hats in the audience?\n\nWe are told that more details will follow in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nMany royal watchers said that St George\u2019s Chapel in Windsor \u2014 a charming city about 20 miles west of London \u2014 was the most likely venue for the wedding. The chapel is contained inside the walls of Windsor Castle, and has been the setting for other royal weddings, including Harry\u2019s cousin Peter Phillips, who married Autumn Kelly, a Canadian, in 2008.\n\nWhen Harry\u2019s father, Prince Charles, married Camilla Parker Bowles in 2005, they held a civil ceremony in Windsor but afterward had a service of blessing at the chapel.\n\nHarry's spokesman told reporters at a briefing in London on Tuesday that Windsor was a \"special place for them.\u201d It\u2019s also where Harry was baptized.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton, said she and her husband, Prince William, are \u201cabsolutely thrilled\u201d about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s engagement.

During an interview broadcast Monday on BBC, Markle was asked about giving up her acting career. She recently wrapped up filming in the legal drama \"Suits.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/washpost/f87cfca4-5656-47df-9be9-83cb6ec9ad1f.png&h=196&w=196", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-11-28/AP/APTOPIX_Britain_Royal_Engagement_28075-ef4e5.jpg&w=1440", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/dr/resources/images/generic-newsletter-signup.png"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-11-28/AP/APTOPIX_Britain_Royal_Engagement_28075-ef4e5.jpg&w=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Adam", "Hannah Natanson", "Emily Yahr", "Reis Thebault", "Katie Mettler", "Tim Craig", "Kim Bellware", "Ben Brasch", "John Harden", "Carson Terbush"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/11/28/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-pick-a-date-and-place-windsor-castle-in-may/", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle pick a place and a date: Windsor Castle in May", "meta_data": {"description": "The wedding will take place in St George's Chapel, palace officials said in a statement, adding that the royal family will foot the bill.", "og": {"site_name": "The Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/11/28/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-pick-a-date-and-place-windsor-castle-in-may/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-11-28/AP/APTOPIX_Britain_Royal_Engagement_28075-ef4e5.jpg&w=1440", "title": "Analysis | Prince Harry and Meghan Markle pick a place and a date: Windsor Castle in May", "description": "The wedding will take place in St George's Chapel, palace officials said in a statement, adding that the royal family will foot the bill."}, "og_site_name": "The Washington Post", "og_type": "article", "og_url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/11/28/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-pick-a-date-and-place-windsor-castle-in-may/", "og_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-11-28/AP/APTOPIX_Britain_Royal_Engagement_28075-ef4e5.jpg&w=1440", "og_title": "Analysis | Prince Harry and Meghan Markle pick a place and a date: Windsor Castle in May", "og_description": "The wedding will take place in St George's Chapel, palace officials said in a statement, adding that the royal family will foot the bill.", "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Analysis | Prince Harry and Meghan Markle pick a place and a date: Windsor Castle in May", "description": "The wedding will take place in St George's Chapel, palace officials said in a statement, adding that the royal family will foot the bill."}, "last_updated_date": "2021-12-01T06:06:31.982Z", "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-28T18:37:58.000Z", "modified_time": "2021-12-01T06:06:31.982Z", "section": "World", "content_tier": "metered"}, "article_published_time": "2017-11-28T18:37:58.000Z", "article_modified_time": "2021-12-01T06:06:31.982Z", "article_section": "World", "article_content_tier": "metered", "og_author": "Karla Adam", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "next-head-count": 88, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=352509417, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/11/28/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-pick-a-date-and-place-windsor-castle-in-may/?sourceApp=apple-banner"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511845200.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
