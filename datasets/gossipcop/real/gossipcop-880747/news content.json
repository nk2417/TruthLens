I mean, that's always a good thing, Anthony Rizzo with his shirt off. That's always good news.'\n\n\n\nThe 35-year-old actress, who is nominated for an Emmy in Outstanding Lead actress in a Drama Series, feels that it's exactly the matter that makes it resonate so well with the audience and inspires her fans to share their feelings with its stars.\n\n\n\nShe explained, 'It inspires them. It's sometimes very dark but they feel they've taken hope from it and that means a lot to me.'", "images": ["https://static.mid-day.com/assets/images/googlefollowimg.png", "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2025/nov/Revised1_d_d.png", "https://www.mid-day.com/assets/images/thumb-down.png", "https://static.mid-day.com/assets/images/happiest-places-desktop.png", "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2025/nov/aaszUapaaaaaiDasRakaAJpAAAtauaaga4aAA-1763644633830_d.png", "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2017/sep/Elisabeth-Moss-l.jpg", "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2025/nov/Shirley-Bose-a-1763671272117_d.png", "https://static.mid-day.com/assets/images/latest-icons.png", "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2025/nov/aaszUapaaaaaiDaasRakaaAJaapAAAaAtapuaaga4aAA_d.jpg", "https://static.mid-day.com/assets/images/twitter-new-icon.png", "https://static.mid-day.com/assets/images/logo.png", "https://static.mid-day.com/assets/images/youtube-shorts-icon.png", "https://www.mid-day.com/assets/images/thumb-up.png", "https://static.mid-day.com/assets/images/shotbutton.png", "https://static.mid-day.com/assets/images/epaper-rhs-banner.jpg?tr=w-300,h-235", "https://static.mid-day.com/assets/images/happiest-places-mobile.png", "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2025/nov/nanadamuribalaksa-1763660874345_d.png", "https://static.mid-day.com/assets/images/notification.gif", "https://static.mid-day.com/assets/images/article-conscent-loader.gif", "https://static.mid-day.com/assets/images/webstories-icon-desktop.png", "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2017/sep/Elisabeth-Moss.jpg", "https://static.mid-day.com/assets/images/newspaper-icon.png", "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2024/nov/Revised_m.jpg", "https://static.mid-day.com/assets/images/webstories-icon.png", "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2025/nov/hah-amsrit-lkans-1763659669024_d.png", "https://static.mid-day.com/assets/images/flight.png"], "top_img": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2017/sep/Elisabeth-Moss-l.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Top Authors"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/hollywood-news/article/emmy-awards-2017-elisabeth-moss-nomination-gif-hollywood-news-18588154", "title": "Emmy Awards 2017: Elisabeth Moss found out about her nomination through a GIF!", "meta_data": {"keywords": "Elisabeth Moss, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, The Handmaid's Tale, 69th Emmy Awards, Emmy Awards 2017,  Emmy Awards, Hollywood news", "news_keywords": "Elisabeth Moss, Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, The Handmaid's Tale, 69th Emmy Awards, Emmy Awards 2017,  Emmy Awards, Hollywood news", "og": {"title": "Emmy Awards 2017: Elisabeth Moss found out about her nomination through a GIF!", "site_name": "Mid-day", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/hollywood-news/article/emmy-awards-2017-elisabeth-moss-nomination-gif-hollywood-news-18588154", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.mid-day.com/images/images/2017/sep/Elisabeth-Moss-l.jpg", "alt": "Elisabeth Moss accepts the award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for 'The Handmaid's Tale' during the 69th Emmy Awards at the Microsoft Theatre in Los Angeles.
