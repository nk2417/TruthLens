His attitude is that all professional athletes do it, and many of them do. La La has put up with a lot. She knew it was going on, but I guess this time she\u2019s had enough.\u201d\n\nA rep for Melo declined to comment on allegations of his cheating or the report that he impregnated a stripper who works at a New York gentlemen\u2019s club over six months ago. The dancer allegedly is demanding money for medical bills and other baby expenses.\n\nA source close to Melo added, \u201cThe stripper pregnancy rumor is not true. Yes he\u2019s not been perfect, but the baby with a stripper isn\u2019t true.\u201d\n\nOther sources say La La and Carmelo currently have no plans to file for divorce.\n\nOne told Page Six, \u201cThey\u2019ve been living separately for several months. They\u2019ve broken up in the past, they split three years ago, gave it some time and then got back together. They\u2019re hoping the same works again.\u201d\n\nIn the light of the new allegations that Carmelo impregnated a stripper, as reported by TMZ, a source close to his wife said, \u201cLa La doesn\u2019t want to deal with all of these rumors \u2026 she doesn\u2019t want to focus on any of it at the moment \u2026 She\u2019ll deal with it when it all comes down.\n\n\u201cThe cheating rumors have always been out there and the majority will talk about the rumors over and over. She\u2019s waiting on his team to respond and decide how to handle the rumors.\u201d\n\nA complicating factor is that La La\u2019s career is really taking off just when Carmelo\u2019s really struggling with his. She\u2019s starring in 50 Cent\u2018s \u201cPower\u201d and last week she wrapped her latest movie, \u201cEmergency Furlough\u201d with Whoopi Goldberg and Anna Paquin. She\u2019s also hosting a Mother\u2019s Day special on VH1.\n\nThe source continued, \u201cCarmelo\u2019s career problems, on the other hand, don\u2019t put him in a good mental place,\u201d adding, \u201cThere\u2019s also the uncertainty about their future \u2014 Carmelo is likely to be leaving New York but who knows for where.\n\n\u201cThey want to see how that shakes out before figuring out what to do.\u201d\n\nOf the couple, who have a 10-year-old son, Kiyan, the source said, \u201cLa La thinks Melo is a great dad. But the fact is, they\u2019re better when they\u2019re not together.\u201d", "images": ["https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/CMA.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/04/lala-melo.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=653", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F100-live-115674573.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115743727.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115485559.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/kevin-spacey-reveals-homeless-living-115762000.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/fergie.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115752191.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115743727.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fjones-road-black-friday-sale.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1763551750&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fbethenny-frankels-gift-picks-include-115619188.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115742458.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/fergie.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/kevin-spacey-reveals-homeless-living-115762000.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/04/lala-melo.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115733621.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/minka-kelly-jenna-bush-hager.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115723827.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115742458.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/04/dsc_3033_2_142664405-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115731438.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2FCMA.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2FKrisJennersaystheseamazingPDRNproductshavebecomehernewessentials.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/04/dsc_3010_3_142664445.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115757930.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/04/lala-melo.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/04/18/how-carmelo-anthony-justified-allegedly-cheating-on-la-la/", "title": "Exclusive | How Carmelo Anthony justified allegedly cheating on La La", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
