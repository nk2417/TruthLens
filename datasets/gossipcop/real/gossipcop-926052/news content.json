I came back to Winter Games because I\u2019ve seen this franchise work miracles before. Through The Bachelor and my journey around the world, I have made deep connections, true meaningful intimate relationships with many walks of life. I know it\u2019s imperative to find someone who chooses us and acknowledges our many layers, who can be open and vulnerable, and most importantly, who is ready. To meet someone and be met. To be chosen and to choose. To love and to be loved. This is everything. All we need is that same energy reciprocated, and despite how open and loving you attempt to be, people can only meet you as deeply as they\u2019ve met themselves.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars Who Love The Bachelor Stars really are just like Us \u2014 they, too, can\u2019t get enough of the Bachelor franchise!

It was a long winter, and I\u2019m excited for a new season. Let the spring cleaning commence. I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\nOne day earlier, Unglert posted a cryptic message to his own personal account after it was reported that the pair had called it quits.\n\nRelated: Biggest Bachelor and Bachelorette Villains Evil comes in all shapes and sizes in Bachelor Nation!

I always had this idea that no matter what you did, no matter how you act, as long as you\u2019re true to yourself and act in good conscious, your path would lead you to the one person on this planet you\u2019re meant to be with,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older, I\u2019ve learned that although everyone DESERVES love, it\u2019s not something we\u2019re entitled to. Love takes work. Love is compromise. Love is earned. I still have a lot of work to do on myself, a lot to prove to myself, before I\u2019m ready for something like that.\u201d\n\nMurphy and Unglert began dating on the ABC series and the Bachelorette alum gave her a key to his place during the finale.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
