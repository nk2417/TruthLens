{"url": "https://ew.com/tv/the-office-where-are-they-now/", "text": "As we celebrate two decades of The Office and gear up for its next chapter, let's clock in to where the original cast is now.\n\nChronicling the daily absurdities of a humble Scranton, Pa., paper company, this nine-season sitcom \u2014 an adaptation of Ricky Gervais ' British original \u2014 redefined the workplace comedy genre while propelling the careers of Steve Carell , John Krasinski , Mindy Kaling , and more of its ensemble. Fans have rewatched, reunited, and quoted it into oblivion, but now there's fresh ink in the printer.\n\nAs today marks the 20th anniversary of the premiere of The Office , it's hard to picture a world without its best boss and his Dunder Mifflin crew. But when the mockumentary series first aired as a midseason replacement on NBC on March 24, 2005, it struggled in the ratings and nearly got laid off. But \"well, well, well, how the turntables\" \u2014 season 2 came back stronger, reviving the network's Thursday night lineup and ushering in a new era of comedy post- Friends .\n\nAngela Kinsey (Angela Martin) Angela Martin; Angela Kinsey. Paul Drinkwater/NBCU/Getty Images; Gregg DeGuire/WireImage Angela Kinsey was best known for a recurring voice role on King of the Hill before being cast as uptight, rule-stickler Angela Martin on The Office. Her scandalous, long-kept secret office romance with Dwight Schrute served as a fun counterpoint to the more tender romance of Jim and Pam. \"I think the show keeps finding an audience, A) because it's really funny and it holds up. But also because I think the workers at Dunder Mifflin were this dysfunctional family,\" she told Today in 2020. \"And we all have a Dwight in our family. We all have an aunt that's like Angela.\" She's continued to excel on television, starring on Hulu's Real Housewives spoof The Hotwives of Las Vegas and the Netflix series Haters Back Off!. She was a guest star on The Real O'Neals, Life in Pieces, New Girl, Impress Me, and more. She also costarred in Netflix's Tall Girl (2019) and its 2022 sequel, and lead Hallmark's Confessions of a Christmas Letter. She cohosts Office Ladies with Fischer and wrote the book Office BFFs with her former costar. Kinsey shares a child with her ex-husband, writer and producer Warren Lieberstein. Since 2016, she's been married to actor Joshua Snyder and is stepmom to his two children.\n\nKate Flannery (Meredith Palmer) Meredith Palmer; Kate Flannery. Chris Haston/NBC/Getty Images; JC Olivera/Getty Images Kate Flannery was well-known in the comedy world and as a stage performer before landing the part of the boozy Meredith Palmer. \"Meredith was such a beautiful character to play. She could get a laugh without even having a line,\" she told Philadelphia Magazine in 2023. \"I might just do something small in the background. I loved the subtlety of it. My mother would always say, 'I wish Meredith talked more.' But I feel like when Meredith talked, it was worth the wait. This was a really smart show that treated the audience like they had a brain.\"\n\nFlannery's since taken on similarly bawdy, gruff, and outlandish characters in guest-starring roles on shows like New Girl, Kevin (Probably) Saves the World, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and Night Court. She lent her voice talents to the cartoons OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes and Steven Universe, and had a nine-episode stint on the Hulu series All Night. In 2019, Flannery was a contestant on Dancing With the Stars (ultimately placing seventh), and five years later, she competed on The Masked Singer (placing eighth). Flannery has been with her longtime partner, photographer Chris Haston, since 2006.\n\nOscar Nu\u00f1ez (Oscar Martinez) Oscar Martinez; Oscar Nu\u00f1ez. Paul Drinkwater/NBCU/Getty Images; Greg Doherty/Getty Images Oscar Nu\u00f1ez built himself a solid career as a comedian and actor before earning his biggest role yet as Oscar Martinez, an office employee who is frequently the target of casual racism and homophobia. In 2009, he had a memorable turn as a stripper (and various other occupations) named Ramone in The Proposal. \"[The Office] holds up, 'cause it's just so well written. And then the cast was really good. If the cast sucked, but it was well written, or if the cast was great, and it wasn't well written, we can't do anything if we don't have material,\" he said to Today in 2020. \"It's just a workplace, and then it's all based on the characters, on people's foibles and people's peccadilloes and delusions of grandeur.\u201d Following The Office, he's headlined shows like Benched and People of Earth, as well as guest-starred on Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Shameless, and Liv and Maddie. He also played Mr. Hernandez on Netflix's Mr. Iglesias; guested on three episodes of Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist; and had supporting parts in The Lost City (2022), Disenchanted (2022), and Dashing Through the Snow (2023). Nu\u00f1ez is the only Office cast member signed on for the Peacock follow-up series. He shares a child with his actress Ursula Whittaker, whom he married in 2011.\n\nCreed Bratton (Creed Bratton) Creed Bratton; Creed Bratton. Justin Lubin/NBC/Getty Images; Leon Bennett/WireImage Creed Bratton \u2014 who, before the show, was likely best known as a member of the folk band the Grass Roots \u2014 plays a fictional version of himself on The Office as the resident eccentric, enigmatic oddball. \"I think in these times, we need something with a good heart and a kindness to it, and even though it was cringeworthy comedy, [the show] had heart and it just touched a sweet spot,\" he told Today in 2020. \"I think truly The Office has a sweet spot for everyone or else they wouldn't keep coming back to it. I know I loved being on that show, and apparently everyone else loved it too, so, lucky us. All of us.\u201d Since The Office, he's guest-starred on various shows like Grace and Frankie, Franklin & Bash, and Upload, and has appeared in films such as Terri (2011), The Guilt Trip (2012), and The Sisters Brothers (2018). He's also released solo studio albums, such as Slightly Altered (2020) and Tao Pop (2024).\n\nEd Helms (Andy Bernard) Andy Bernard; Ed Helms. Chris Haston/NBC/Getty Images; Paul Bruinooge/Patrick McMullan via Getty Images Like Steve Carell, Ed Helms was another former Daily Show correspondent who rose to wider fame on The Office, portraying a cappella-obsessed Cornell alum Andy Bernard. \"The staying power of that show is just mind-boggling,\" he said during a 2021 appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. \"People love it, and I'm so proud to be part of it. That's all amazing.\" Helms hit it big on the big screen as a mild-mannered dentist who loses a tooth after a wild night in Vegas in 2009's The Hangover. He has since appeared in multiple Hangover sequels and other films like Cedar Rapids (2011), We're the Millers (2013), Tag (2018) and Family Switch (2023). Helms also continued to amass a long string of guest-star credits on shows like Brooklyn Nine-Nine, The Mindy Project, Angie Tribeca, Arrested Development, and more. In 2021, he co-created and starred on the Peacock sitcom Rutherford Falls, which was cancelled after two seasons.\n\nPaul Lieberstein (Toby Flenderson) Paul Lieberstein; Toby Flenderson. Mitchell Haaseth/NBC/Getty Images; Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images Paul Lieberstein moonlighted as put-upon HR rep Toby Flenderson for all nine seasons of The Office, but he was also actually one of the executive producers and writers of the show, even becoming showrunner for seasons 5\u20138. \"So this was like kind of a very traditional thing that writers and actors are kind of separated on a TV show, you know, and they're kind of asked not to talk.... We talked about just doing a little thing to kind of have the experience of being an actor. And hopefully it would inform our writing,\" Lieberstein explained in a 2020 episode of the Office Ladies podcast. \"I'm not sure how Toby happened, but I feel like I left the room and I came back and they said, 'You're going to play this part.' And it was one line, you know, in \"Diversity Day\" \u2014 I say this one line and get kicked out of the room.\"\n\nFollowing The Office, he went on to executive produce the third and final season of The Newsroom, which he appeared on as a train passenger named Richard Westbrook. He also took over as showrunner for Fox's short-lived Ghosted. He guest-starred on an episode of The Mindy Project and had a recurring role on the series People of Earth. In 2018, he wrote and directed his first feature film, Song of Back and Neck, which screened at the Tribeca Film Festival. He went on to write and direct the 2022 Comedy Central TV movie Out of Office. In 2008, Lieberstein married Janine Serafin Poreba \u2014 who appeared in the first two episodes of The Office as Toby's girlfriend, Amy.", "images":
