The stars of Marvel Studios\u2019 Avengers: Infinity War boarded a bus for the company\u2019s inaugural tour.\n\nTom Hiddleston was the first castmember to arrive. After Hiddleston introduced himself, a quiet Corden responded, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just got lost in your eyes.\u201d\n\nPaul Bettany, Chris Pratt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Pom Klementieff, Zoe Saldana, Winston Duke, Sebastian Stan, Letitia Wright, Elizabeth Olsen, Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie and Josh Brolin then all boarded the bus one by one to join Hiddleston on the tour. \u201cThis is more stars than I could have dreamt of,\u201d declared Corden during the boarding process.\n\nWhile welcoming the group to the tour, Corden stated that flash photography was allowed. \u201cJust make sure you tag me in all the photos,\u201d he said. The host added, \u201cWeapons are prohibited on the bus. That includes firearms, mace, war hammers, Vibranium and Infinity Gauntlets.\u201d\n\nCorden then checked that everyone was wearing sunscreen before assigning Cumberbatch and Pratt to apply sunscreen to his own legs.\n\nThe first stop on the tour was a local Coffee Bean. \u201cThat is where, when you shout out of a room, \u2018Can someone get me a coffee?\u2019 someone will run down to a shop very similar to that, and they will physically go in, wait in line and bring you back the coffee,\u201d Corden explained to the actors.\n\nThe next planned activity was a sing-along led by bandleader Reggie Watts. \u201cI like outer space, looking at alien races. Utilizing energy weapons,\u201d the group sang in unison following Watts\u2019 lead. \u201cIf somebody attacks me, I have the skills to defend myself. And if somebody doubts me \u2026 Well, that\u2019s too bad for them, because they gonna die.\u201d\n\nThe actors then stopped to take pictures and learn about places like Barbra Streisand\u2019s alleged holiday home and a popular brunch spot.\n\nBrolin asked the tour guide if he could stop to use the bathroom, to which Corden explained an exclusive bathroom privilege that the actor did not yet have. \u201cThe problem with that, Josh, is, as rules on the Star Tours, you have to have appeared in three or more Marvel movies to use the bathroom. End-credit scenes don\u2019t count.\u201d\n\nCorden then tried to get the scoop on the latest Marvel spoilers by asking if anyone on the bus dies in the next Avengers movie. After a moment of silence, Bettany shouted, \u201cSnitches end up in ditches!\u201d\n\nThe actors eventually made a pit stop at Golden Apple Comics, where they greeted fans, signed comic books and took pictures. As the Avengers stars were busy talking with fans, Corden stood by a Peter Rabbit poster, eagerly waiting for someone to ask for his autograph.\n\nOnce the group got back on the tour bus, Watts and Corden led another sing-along. \u201cWe save the world. We are Avengers. We\u2019ll probably be doing these movies till we have dentures,\u201d they sang. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re hoping to escape without a scratch. We must protect the pretty face of Cumberbatch.\u201d\n\nAs Corden wrapped up the tour, a very late Chris Hemsworth boarded the bus and tried to join. As his co-stars got off the bus, Corden reluctantly agreed to give the tour all over again for the tardy star.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/112593_167bc-h_2018_0.jpg?w=1280&h=722&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/112593_167bc-h_2018_0.jpg?w=1280&h=722&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Schaffstall", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/james-corden-hosts-avengers-infinity-war-cast-tour-around-los-angeles-1106488/", "title": "James Corden Hosts \u2018Avengers: Infinity War\u2019 Cast on Tour Around Los Angeles", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The 'Late Late Show' host's tour included a stop at a comic book store full of Marvel fans.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Katherine Schaffstall", "tags": "Avengers: Infinity War, Chris Hemsworth, James Corden, Josh Brolin, Late Night TV, The Late Late Show, Tom Hiddleston", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "James Corden Hosts \u2018Avengers: Infinity War\u2019 Cast on Tour Around Los Angeles", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/james-corden-hosts-avengers-infinity-war-cast-tour-around-los-angeles-1106488/", "description": "The 'Late Late Show' host's tour included a stop at a comic book store full of Marvel fans.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/112593_167bc-h_2018_0.jpg?w=1280&h=722&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 578, "alt": "James Corden Hosts 'Avengers: Infinity War' Cast on Tour Around Los Angeles"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-27T11:33:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-27T13:15:31+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 'Late Late Show' host's tour included a stop at a comic book store full of Marvel fans.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "James Corden Hosts \u2018Avengers: Infinity War\u2019 Cast on Tour Around Los Angeles", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/112593_167bc-h_2018_0.jpg?w=1280&h=722&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524828815.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
