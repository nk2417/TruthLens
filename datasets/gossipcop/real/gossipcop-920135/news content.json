They\u2019re shaped, of course, by the footage editors choose to air\u2014though it always helps when Bachelors, Bachelorettes, and their would-be suitors come in with personalities of their own, ready to be enhanced and exaggerated into TV gold. Last year, Rachel Lindsay proved she\u2019s a smart, no-nonsense lawyer with an occasionally risqu\u00e9 sense of humor. Before her, there was Joelle \u201cJoJo\u201d Fletcher, a bubbly Texan who felt like an amalgamation of every Southern Girl trope\u2014a somewhat obvious identity, but a clear one.\n\nThis year\u2019s Bachelorette, though, is tougher to pin down. What is Rebecca \u201cBecca\u201d Kufrin\u2019s \u201cthing\u201d\u2014and does The Bachelorette even care if she has one?\n\nThroughout this season, as we\u2019ve gotten to know Becca\u2019s contestants, it\u2019s become increasingly clear that we also don\u2019t know much about the woman whose heart they\u2019re competing to win. Nothing about Becca feels particularly specific, beyond the information one could find on a title card. She\u2019s from Minnesota. She works in P.R. What else? You\u2019d be hard pressed to think of much.\n\nInstead, Becca continues to be defined by the incident that landed her the Bachelorette gig in the first place: her horrific breakup with Arie Luyendyk Jr. on the last season of The Bachelor. Which is frustrating. A breakup can make for a good beginning, but the rest of the story has to go somewhere. And rather than build Becca up as a character and give her a redemptive romantic romp, this season has appeared more than happy to let her simply exist as a passive participant in her own story.\n\nMost of this season\u2019s most intense drama has occurred offscreen, as when viewers found out that front-runner Garrett Yrigoyen has an appalling social-media history, and eliminated contestant Lincoln Adim had been convicted of assault and battery. Within the confines of the series itself, however, the proceedings have been pretty rote: there was the requisite feud between two equally annoying contestants, the jealous meltdown, and the cool guy eliminated too soon. Arie\u2019s season of The Bachelor was widely called out for being boring, and now, Becca\u2019s, which sprang from that dull well, appears to have committed the same sin. That reality grew even more stark as the show betrayed its apparent true goal this week: making sure there is at least one potential Bachelor on lock for next year, even if the producers have to manufacture him out of thin air. They\u2019ll do anything to avoid having a Bachelor as uninspiring as Arie again.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b4e2c719bedd20c4002b7a8/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/t-Bachelorette-Dudes.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/648b34b891601d9e135bad91/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6904b792447a00332ceb4fd3/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69138dc2108d96082627c8f5/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b0d58d814785d7498401a02/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/bachelorette-garrett.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/66e3496b1d2e398b5578d9d4/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68f7f5b76b78476ce0754a1b/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690944318b75c927a793b8d6/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b57233211d0902df883bd10/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/bachelorette-final-two-garrett-blake.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690391f1eebf6e975f3db06f/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6901026c7b6db29214cd9d68/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b08638114785d74984019f8/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/Bachelorette-Becca-Kufrin.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b57233211d0902df883bd10/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/bachelorette-final-two-garrett-blake.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6914ab554a83822bb12772b6/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/67ffb148c73840957cc5df06/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b57233211d0902df883bd10/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/bachelorette-final-two-garrett-blake.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Bradley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/07/bachelorette-final-two-garrett-blake-jason-next-bachelor", "title": "How The Bachelorette Failed Becca Kufrin", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Laura Bradley", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "This season was supposed to be Becca\u2019s chance for redemption.
