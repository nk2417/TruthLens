After booking several national commercials, she was cast in a guest spot on the series Valerie. At age 5, she debuted as Full House's Stephanie Tanner, the middle sister of three. Sweetin continues to perform, appearing in the big-screen releases Small Bits of Happiness (2008), Redefining Love (2009) and Port City (2009).\n\nEarly Life\n\nJodie Lee Ann Sweetin was born on January 19, 1982, in Los Angeles, California. Sweetin was adopted by Sam, a handyman, and Janice, a wedding coordinator. Her acting talent was evident early on and, at the urging of family friends, Janice brought her 4-year-old to meet with a talent agent. After booking several national commercials, Sweetin was cast in a guest spot on the popular series, Valerie. Her precociousness and winning smile caught the eyes of Thomas Miller and Robert Boyett, producers who were then putting together the framework of the sitcom Full House.\n\nFull House\n\nAt the age of 5, Jodie Sweetin debuted as Full House's Stephanie Tanner, the middle sister of three. Her catchphrase\u2014\"How rude!\"\u2014is still requested by fans. That same year, she was cast in Jim Henson Presents: Mother Goose Stories.\n\nAlthough she quickly bonded with her Full House family, Sweetin had a difficult time adjusting to school. A strong student, Sweetin was teased by classmates for her burgeoning fame. She spent her grammar and middle school years trying to embrace a normal life and separate herself from her on-screen persona. At the age of 13, she entered Los Alamitos High School. That year, Full House was canceled, and Sweetin experienced her first brushes with alcohol abuse.\n\nAfter graduating in 1999, Sweetin temporarily capped her acting career with a two-episode role on Party of Five. She began attending Chapman University in Orange, California, and although she had an academic scholarship, she rarely attended classes. Instead, Sweetin's hard-partying ways earned her a .9 GPA, and stanched her scholarship. Sweetin returned to her parent's house to break her ties to drugs and alcohol, and to refocus her life.\n\nDrug Addiction and Rehab\n\nIn July 2002, Sweetin wed boyfriend Shaun Holguin, a police officer. During their marriage, she experimented with crystal methamphetamine, and soon became deeply addicted to the drug. Three years later, after a drug-related hospitalization, she agreed to enter a rehabilitation program. Sweetin underwent six weeks of intensive treatment, and entered a sober living facility after her release. As a result of her addiction, she and Holguin divorced in 2006.\n\nShortly after her time in recovery, Sweetin began to re-enter the limelight. In 2006, she was tapped to host FUSE's Pants-Off Dance-Off. The following year, she met and married Cory Herpin, a set designer. Her daughter Zoie was born in April 2008. Although the couple had plans to star in a reality show about their life and family, they split seven months later.\n\nSweetin continues to perform, appearing in the big-screen releases Small Bits of Happiness (2008), Redefining Love (2009) and Port City (2009). Since then, Sweetin appeared in a couple of independent films. Sweetin had her second child, Beatrix, with her third husband, Morty Coyle. The couple married in March 2012, but their union didn't last. Sweetin announced she was legally separating from Coyle in June 2013.\n\nWatch The Unauthorized Full House Story on Lifetime Movie Club\n\nQUICK FACTS\n\nName: Jodie Sweetin\n\nBirth Year: 1982\n\nBirth date: January 19, 1982\n\nBirth State: California\n\nBirth City: Los Angeles\n\nBirth Country: United States\n\nGender: Female\n\nBest Known For: At age 5, actress Jodie Sweetin debuted as Full House's Stephanie Tanner, the middle sister.
