And what better way to advertise it than by crashing an art show and flipping the bird at the president? If Snoop\u2019s not around, at least Stewart had a convenient portrait to stand in for him.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5810fead2d5899f533f7c12f/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/martha-stewart-sexted.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691505934f93271855d8a78a/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69177930e84ad375fd84ec60/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69134e1408e5ee77e37d2651/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6914df4d4a83822bb12772ba/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6901026c7b6db29214cd9d68/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6919bbed01714426f5a0dc01/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e0661d7f7e7718194d67e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690ce036e4de48864a6dff15/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691755d7cf2db08d53ca35a0/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691c8b089c65b610ab31a7f4/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Stefansky"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/05/martha-stewart-donald-trump-middle-finger", "title": "Martha Stewart Appears to Give Donald Trump the Middle Finger", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Emma Stefansky", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "She crashed an Instagram with portraits of Trump and Snoop Dogg.", "id": "590f4f0f5caad73f2ce0cc95", "keywords": "martha stewart,snoop dogg,donald trump,andres serrano", "news_keywords": "martha stewart,snoop dogg,donald trump,andres serrano", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "590f4f0f5caad73f2ce0cc95", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"She crashed an Instagram with portraits of Trump and Snoop Dogg.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "She crashed an Instagram with portraits of Trump and Snoop Dogg.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Martha Stewart Appears to Give Donald Trump the Middle Finger", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/05/martha-stewart-donald-trump-middle-finger"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-05-07T18:52:25.034Z", "modified_time": "2017-05-07T18:52:25.034Z", "author": "Emma Stefansky"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "She crashed an Instagram with portraits of Trump and Snoop Dogg.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Martha Stewart Appears to Give Donald Trump the Middle Finger"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5841bb78ba2ef6d738a212ab/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/martha-stewart-art-basel.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google": "nopagereadaloud", "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494183145.034, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
