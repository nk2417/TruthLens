But rather than revealing her rumored rekindled love on the red carpet, Gomez debuted a brand-new hairstyle instead: The 25-year-old singer has a chic, icy platinum lob now.\n\nWhether the stunning new blond 'do is a permanent change or a temporary look for the AMAs is unclear\u2014especially considering six hours prior, Gomez had dark hair and blunt bangs, per her Insta story. But her longtime stylist Marissa Marino's Instagram gives us some clues: apparently Nine Zero One colorist Nikki Lee is the one responsible for Gomez's new hair, meaning she very well could have just joined Kim Kardashian and Ariana Grande in the \"real fake blondes\" club. And Gomez also posted a photo with the caption, \"so i am blonde now\" on Instagram right before the show.", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/thegiftshop.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a122070081e4d296f18fbd9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/selena-gomez-2.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_640%2Cq_80%2Cw_640/v1475708212/glamour_9-times-we-wanted-someone-to-look-at-us-the-way-selena-gomez-looks-at-taylor-swift.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/69174c099747b5d130b803e2/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6902283d601dff04f14d5bc6/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690a2debe28cbde87dacf946/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691378e49a4ea3b29e905459/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68fa6a68144538f657f31f4f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6904e66b71ae894e89117f3b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/69012339a18581c0faf5cbd3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690cc1655625e2a9de14e258/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/691c8c4ac82d8405cfaf18f6/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/68fe47b1d896c6cbe8f46045/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-global/assets/logo-oneNav.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a1218079951b31ef0cb8a6a/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-876396354.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/690cf58f5625e2a9de14e271/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.svg?v=1"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a122070081e4d296f18fbd9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/selena-gomez-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lynsey Eidell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/selena-gomez-blonde-bob-american-music-awards-2017", "title": "Selena Gomez Debuts Blond Hair at the American Music Awards 2017", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Lynsey Eidell", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Selena Gomez arrived at the red carpet for the 2017 American Music Awards debuting a new platinum blonde bob.", "id": "5a1212229951b31ef0cb8a62", "keywords": "selena gomez,amas,american music awards", "news_keywords": "selena gomez,amas,american music awards", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a1212229951b31ef0cb8a62", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Selena Gomez arrived at the red carpet for the 2017 American Music Awards debuting a new platinum blonde bob.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a121c5b95a2ed7694d9b3a9/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/SELENA-GOMEZ.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a121c5b95a2ed7694d9b3a9/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/SELENA-GOMEZ.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "It looks SO good.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a122070081e4d296f18fbd9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/selena-gomez-2.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Selena Gomez Just Went Platinum Blond!", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/selena-gomez-blonde-bob-american-music-awards-2017"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-11-20T00:14:39.125Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-20T00:14:39.125Z", "author": "Lynsey Eidell"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "It looks SO good.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a122070081e4d296f18fbd9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/selena-gomez-2.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Selena Gomez Just Went Platinum Blond!"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a122070081e4d296f18fbd9/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/selena-gomez-2.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511136879.125, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
