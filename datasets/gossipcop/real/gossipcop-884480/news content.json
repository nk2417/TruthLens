Log in .\n\nNetflix made a deal with Marvel Comics back in 2013 to produce four Marvel-universe shows and a mini-series.\n\nThe deal expanded in 2017, when Netflix released its sixth Marvel show, \"The Punisher.\" Its latest is season three of \"Daredevil,\" which dropped October 19.\n\nUnfortunately, two of the shows have already been canceled: \"Iron Fist\" and \"Luke Cage,\" which both had two seasons.\n\nTo find out which of the Marvel Netflix shows have fared the best among critics, we turned to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes for the composite critical receptions of all seasons for each series. We used audience scores to break any ties.\n\nHere are Netflix's six original Marvel shows, ranked from worst to best, according to critics:", "images": ["https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5bca24b9dde8676b04591013?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/57f509d49bd9789b018b4d36?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "https://i.insider.com/57e28473dd0895775e8b4ed0?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5bca24b8dde8676b0459100e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5975f5879d09183b521615eb?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a0f29d83dbef41e008b6c99?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5b918a772be4ab392d8b4dd3?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5bd06c42d2e64854e77d5718?width=700", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5bca24b8dde8676b0459100e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["John Lynch", "Carrie Wittmer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-original-marvel-shows-ranked-worst-to-best-2017-9", "title": "Netflix's 6 original Marvel superhero shows, ranked from worst to best", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Netflix's 6 original Marvel superhero shows, ranked from worst to best", "datePublished": "2018-10-24T13:02:00.000Z", "dateModified": "2018-10-24T13:02:47.000Z", "news_keywords": "Tech, Media, News, Entertainment, Lifestyle, TV, Netflix, Marvel", "description": "We turned to Rotten Tomatoes to see which of Netflix's original Marvel shows, from \"Luke Cage\" to \"The Punisher\" to \"Daredevil,\" have fared the best among critics.", "author": "John Lynch, Carrie Wittmer", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "tbi-vertical": "Tech", "og": {"title": "Netflix's 6 original Marvel superhero shows, ranked from worst to best", "description": "We turned to Rotten Tomatoes to see which of Netflix's original Marvel shows, from \"Luke Cage\" to \"The Punisher\" to \"Daredevil,\" have fared the best among critics.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-original-marvel-shows-ranked-worst-to-best-2017-9", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/5bca24b8dde8676b0459100e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"psvp": "c"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "59b6d9b6609c30390b8b644c", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"sections": "Tech", "tags": "Page Type:slideshow"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2025-05", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
