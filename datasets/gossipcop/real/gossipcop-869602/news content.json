He has insulted our dignity.\"\n\nLast year, Ms Jenner told the BBC that she had been \"really upset\" by some of the president's policies, including his decision to revoke Obama-era guidance which allowed transgender students to use school toilets matching their gender identity.\n\n\"It doesn't make me regret my vote yet, but it is very disappointing and I have been very verbal about that,\" she said at the time.", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/6F9D/production/_104037582_38eb5b2e-da00-45ce-bedf-71836af841e1.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/96AD/production/_104037583_38eb5b2e-da00-45ce-bedf-71836af841e1.jpg", "https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/96AD/production/_104037583_38eb5b2e-da00-45ce-bedf-71836af841e1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45987123", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner: Trump 'relentlessly attacking' trans people", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "page.section": "News", "page.subsection": "Us_and_canada", "og": {"title": "Caitlyn Jenner: Trump 'relentlessly attacking' trans people", "description": "The Republican activist says the president has \"relentlessly attacked\" the transgender community.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/96AD/production/_104037583_38eb5b2e-da00-45ce-bedf-71836af841e1.jpg", "alt": "Caitlyn Jenner arrives at the 2018 Vanity Fair Oscar Party, 4 March 2018"}}, "twitter": {"title": "Caitlyn Jenner: Trump 'relentlessly attacking' trans people", "description": "The Republican activist says the president has \"relentlessly attacked\" the transgender community.", "image": {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/96AD/production/_104037583_38eb5b2e-da00-45ce-bedf-71836af841e1.jpg", "alt": "Caitlyn Jenner arrives at the 2018 Vanity Fair Oscar Party, 4 March 2018"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "The Republican activist says the president has \"relentlessly attacked\" the transgender community.", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364147881, app-argument=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45987123", "version": "web-2.33.2-3", "al": {"ios": {"url": "bbcx://news/world-us-canada-45987123", "app_store_id": 364147881, "app_name": "BBC: World News & Stories"}, "android": {"url": "bbcx://news/world-us-canada-45987123", "app_name": "BBC: World News & Stories", "package": "bbc.mobile.news.ww"}, "web": {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45987123"}}, "cXenseParse": {"pageclass": "article", "publishtime": "2018-10-26T01:18:48.000Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2018-10-26T01:18:48.000Z"}, "next-head-count": 41}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.bbc.com", "summary": ""}
