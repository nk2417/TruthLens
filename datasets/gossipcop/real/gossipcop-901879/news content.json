In a joint statement, Carey and Dick Clark Productions said, \u201cWe can all agree that last year didn\u2019t go exactly as planned and we are thrilled to move forward together to provide America with an incredible night of music and celebration on Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve with Ryan Seacrest 2018. See you in Times Square!\u201d\n\nCarey will once again perform at 11:45 p.m. EST on the special despite blaming Dick Clark Productions for turning the New Year\u2019s show into \u201can opportunity to humiliate me,\u201d the singer said after last year\u2019s mishap.\n\nA faulty in-ear monitor was ultimately blamed as the cause for the nightmarish performance, with Carey unable to hear the backing music among \u201call the noise, the freezing cold, the smoke from the smoke machines, and thousands of people celebrating,\u201d the singer said. Instead of singing along with her \u201cEmotions\u201d and \u201cWe Belong Together,\u201d Carey spoke to the crowd about her technical difficulties while still following the planned choreography.\n\nAt the time, Carey\u2019s management was also upset that Dick Clark Productions didn\u2019t withhold the performance from the West Coast feed. However, Carey has since parted ways with that management team and is now repped by Roc Nation, who championed the \u201credemptive\u201d performance.\n\nThis year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve performance will follow the template of Carey\u2019s recent Las Vegas residency, where the singer is accompanied by a full band and dancers, Variety reports.\n\nCamila Cabello, Nick Jonas, Sugarland and Britney Spears (via satellite from her Piece of Me show in Las Vegas) are also scheduled to appear on the Ryan Seacrest-hosted special.", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-630828088-445069d6-dd9f-4e58-86ce-7bb3e1c67db1.jpg?w=1024&h=662&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-630828088-445069d6-dd9f-4e58-86ce-7bb3e1c67db1.jpg?w=1024&h=662&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Kreps", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mariah-carey-to-return-to-dick-clarks-new-years-rockin-eve-special-197593/", "title": "Mariah Carey to Return to \u2018Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve\u2019 Special", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Mariah Carey will return to Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on December 31st, exactly a year after the singer staged a disastrous performance.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Daniel Kreps", "tags": "Mariah Carey", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Mariah Carey to Return to 'Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve' Special", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mariah-carey-to-return-to-dick-clarks-new-years-rockin-eve-special-197593/", "description": "Mariah Carey will return to Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on December 31st, exactly a year after the singer staged a disastrous performance.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-630828088-445069d6-dd9f-4e58-86ce-7bb3e1c67db1.jpg?w=1024&h=662&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 662, "alt": "Mariah Carey to Return to 'New Year's Rockin' Eve' Special"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-23T01:17:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T16:16:21+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mariah Carey will return to Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve on December 31st, exactly a year after the singer staged a disastrous performance.", "site": "@RollingStone", "creator": "@danielkreps", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mariah Carey to Return to \u2018Dick Clark\u2019s New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve\u2019 Special", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-630828088-445069d6-dd9f-4e58-86ce-7bb3e1c67db1.jpg?w=1024&h=662&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513991838.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
