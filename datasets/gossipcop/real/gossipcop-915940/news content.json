We spoke to Drag Race superfans for their predictions on who they want to win - and why.\n\nAquaria\n\nAllow Instagram content?

And she's also been impressed with her knowledge of drag and LGBT culture.\n\n\"Aquaria is very young and to have all the cultural references, the confidence and the self-awareness is a real testament to her as a queen,\" he says.\n\nKameron Michaels\n\nAllow Instagram content?

She's often lifted up so many other queens who have been in the race.\"\n\nShould the final four be more diverse?\n\nVH1 Aquaria, Kameron, Eureka and Asia entered the show among a broad and diverse range of contestants\n\nNoni, along with some viewers and even contestants, says she is disappointed by the lack of more queens of colour in the final four - in a series where the likes of Monet X Change, The Vixen and Monique Heart brought some of the most memorable moments.\n\nShe says both Kameron and Eureka have been given second chances by the show's judges which would not have been given to contestants of colour.\n\n\"Lots of black queens haven't been given the same time, support - space to be better,\" she says.\n\n\"It echoes society that black women are judged more harshly and you have to be a certain way - if you're not then you're not important and you have to work ten times harder than everyone else.\"\n\nThe season 10 final of RuPaul's Drag Race will screen in the UK on Netflix on 28 June 2018.\n\nFollow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.", "images": ["https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251110-152207-94080fba49-web-2.33.2-3/grey-placeholder.png", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/0AFE/production/_102141820_season10finalists976.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/B434/production/_102123164_dragrace10.jpg.webp", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DB44/production/_102123165_dragrace10.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/604B/production/_97415642_007_in_numbers_624.png.webp"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DB44/production/_102123165_dragrace10.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-44546430", "title": "RuPaul's Drag Race: Who should win season 10?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "page.section": "News", "page.subsection": "Newsbeat", "og": {"title": "RuPaul's Drag Race: Who should win season 10?", "description": "Drag Race superfans explain why either Aquaria, Kameron, Eureka or Asia should win the 2018 series of the show.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DB44/production/_102123165_dragrace10.jpg", "alt": "RuPaul's Drag Race"}}, "twitter": {"title": "RuPaul's Drag Race: Who should win season 10?", "description": "Drag Race superfans explain why either Aquaria, Kameron, Eureka or Asia should win the 2018 series of the show.", "image": {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/DB44/production/_102123165_dragrace10.jpg", "alt": "RuPaul's Drag Race"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "description": "Drag Race superfans explain why either Aquaria, Kameron, Eureka or Asia should win the 2018 series of the show.", "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "NOODP, NOYDIR", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=364147881, app-argument=https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-44546430", "version": "web-2.33.2-3", "al": {"ios": {"url": "bbcx://news/newsbeat-44546430", "app_store_id": 364147881, "app_name": "BBC: World News & Stories"}, "android": {"url": "bbcx://news/newsbeat-44546430", "app_name": "BBC: World News & Stories", "package": "bbc.mobile.news.ww"}, "web": {"url": "https://bbc.com/news/newsbeat-44546430"}}, "cXenseParse": {"pageclass": "article", "publishtime": "2018-06-25T00:35:57.000Z", "author": "Michael Baggs"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2018-06-25T00:35:57.000Z"}, "next-head-count": 42}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.bbc.com", "summary": ""}
