Harry had earlier this year admitted to undergoing counseling to cope with the loss of mother Princess Diana.", "images": ["https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Catherine-Princess-of-Wales-attends-the-Royal-Variety-Performance-at-Royal-Albert-Hall-on-November-19-2025-in-London.-Photo-Getty-Images-1-768x476.jpg", "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MF-Masthead-1.png", "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/f85a3a3d-ce7e-4db8-8907-dbdbfb040b9b-768x549.jpg", "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/MiNDFOOD_white.png", "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/MiNDFOOD-copy.jpg", "http://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/harry-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/FILE-PHOTO-A-tourist-kisses-a-monkey-at-the-Jaguar-Animal-Rescue-Center-in-Puerto-Viejo-de-Limon-August-25-2010.--768x461.jpg", "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/harry-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/footer-banner-2.png"], "top_img": "http://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/harry-1024x683.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carmarlena Murdaca"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mindfood.com/article/prince-harry-there-is-much-much-more-that-we-can-do-to-promote-mental-health-awareness/", "title": "Prince Harry: \u2018There Is Much More We Can Do\u2019 To Promote Mental Health Awareness", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Prince Harry: 'There Is Much More We Can Do' To Promote Mental Health Awareness | MiNDFOOD", "description": "According to Prince Harry, more people should take a break from checking their mobile phones to \"process their thoughts\" instead of rushing through their day.", "url": "https://www.mindfood.com/article/prince-harry-there-is-much-much-more-that-we-can-do-to-promote-mental-health-awareness/", "site_name": "MiNDFOOD", "image": "http://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/harry-1024x683.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/mindfoodmag/", "section": "News 24/7"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "According to Prince Harry, more people should take a break from checking their mobile phones to \"process their thoughts\" instead of rushing through their day.", "title": "Prince Harry: 'There Is Much More We Can Do' To Promote Mental Health Awareness | MiNDFOOD", "site": "@mindfood_mag", "image": "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/harry.jpg", "creator": "@mindfood_mag"}, "generator": "Elementor 3.22.1; features: e_optimized_assets_loading, e_optimized_css_loading, additional_custom_breakpoints; settings: css_print_method-internal, google_font-enabled, font_display-auto", "description": "According to Prince Harry, more people should take a break from checking their mobile phones to \"process their thoughts\" instead of rushing through their day.", "google-adsense-platform-account": "ca-host-pub-2644536267352236", "google-adsense-platform-domain": "sitekit.withgoogle.com", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.mindfood.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/favicon.gif"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.mindfood.com", "summary": ""}
