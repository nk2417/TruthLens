They spent $400,000 to renovate the house, which was built in the 1940s, and Farahan said of the home's original condition, \"Visually it looked OK. But the layout was very choppy. You walked into a tiny vestibule, but the living room was the master bedroom. There was a small kitchen with one window and a beehive fireplace in one corner, which we nicknamed 'the pizza oven.' The bathroom floor was giving out; if you jumped up and down in there, you'd end up in the crawl space.\"", "images": ["https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/1JoH3482haSLevnlEMdqhrz36y0=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/11/George-Clooney.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/I4dSiTJhq0kprSuO--deoPCEAmQ=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/06/taylor.png", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/uRsxoLs7Ymmit5ATgRtN2utad40=/221x5:381x236/132x132/filters:format(webp):strip_exif()/2009/09/P-Diddy.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/n1yRpQGIUPFslvK5YCCW9GNO6fY=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2012/01/Asa-Soltan-Rahmati-2.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/uC4mYidzXucBv47uwX6U_nPDjPg=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2012/01/Mercedes-MJ-Javid.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Reza-Farahan.jpg?x46379", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/WwOqyW747p8tOFpz_iNHPhenJWc=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/07/Gharachedaghi.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/KNDSqD-9inbRekV6AGgXDEG2Scw=/375x35:810x586/132x132/filters:format(webp):strip_exif()/2015/09/GettyImages-476575299.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/themes/cnw_2023/svg/logo.svg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/8G0Wvx8Rf-zIVVi0NHzVG7hgddE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2012/01/mike.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/0dOqT2nlNQM7u_J-5xWrCsf2nAw=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/02/Angelina-Jolie.png", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/_hOmdPz8Ht24ZxIeZM7m4mGRouk=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/11/GettyImages-1094653148.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/Y14fttV9jls9mxFLuNAHJTnNWTE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/10/denzel-washington-1.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/lt1abKKVHSBtY-US0k9GLU9MTmM=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/09/Brad-Pitt.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/ku8OWT-D2Wz7r0HTDEgzGTM23so=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2017/12/sf.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/dXuAPIEBU--L_kRib4u0nSzjUtE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/04/Megan-Fox.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/48Eg7ZlSgqZcMhSB26NpacdbZUE=/600x300/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2021/05/Reza-Farahan.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/lY3-oCS-xIdiqDaOi1qHd6UaTjg=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/09/Cristiano-Ronaldo.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/KFAqJ9F4o80l6an2fe78-0jw28s=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/04/rr.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript"], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Reza-Farahan.jpg?x46379", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/reza-farahan-net-worth/", "title": "Reza Farahan Net Worth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Reza Farahan is an Iranian-American real estate agent and reality television star who has a net worth of $3 million.
