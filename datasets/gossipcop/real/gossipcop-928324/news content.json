As The Hollywood Reporter reports, the actress confirmed the news during an interview with Howard Stern on Sirius XM on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it,\u201d Danes said when Stern addressed the rumors that next season would bring the CIA drama to a close. A representative for Showtime told Rolling Stone that the network has not made a decision beyond Season 8.\n\nDanes said she felt \u201creally conflicted\u201d about the series ending. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready,\u201d Danes said. \u201cShe\u2019s a lot, this Carrie fricking Mathison. I mean, she\u2019s under constant duress. I mean, it\u2019s a workout.\n\n\u201cSo, I\u2019ll be ready for a reprieve from that,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut, you know, I\u2019ve never done anything this long.\u201d\n\nShowtime renewed Homeland for an additional two seasons ahead of its Season 6 premiere.\n\nTrending Stories Kevin Spacey Says He Has \u2018No Home\u2019 After Sexual-Misconduct Allegations Kristen Bell Is the Star of a New Jesus Podcast From Fox. No One Told Her Brandi Carlile and Patty Loveless Pay Tribute to Vince Gill at 2025 CMA Awards Is This Mysterious U.K. Rapper Actually Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely going to be my last year,\u201d executive producer and writer Alex Gansa told THR in February, before the show\u2019s seventh season debut. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for Claire or Mandy [Patinkin], but it will be my final year and it will be designed to be the end of an eight-season story. If Showtime, Fox, Claire and Mandy want to take the show further, that\u2019s their decision. And we would leave some room for that to happen, if there\u2019s an appetite.\u201d\n\nThe Season 7 finale airs on April 29th. Homeland has garnered 10 Primetime Emmy Awards, including Danes winning two for best actress in a drama series.", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/clairedaneshomeland-fc6be6a3-22eb-47c1-99b5-bb5eeefef39a.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/clairedaneshomeland-fc6be6a3-22eb-47c1-99b5-bb5eeefef39a.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Althea Legaspi", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/claire-danes-says-homeland-will-end-with-season-8-630195/", "title": "Claire Danes Says \u2018Homeland\u2019 Will End With Season 8", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "'Homeland' will end after Season 8, according to the show's star Claire Danes.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Althea Legaspi", "tags": "Claire Danes, Homeland, Showtime", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Claire Danes Says 'Homeland' Will End With Season 8", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-news/claire-danes-says-homeland-will-end-with-season-8-630195/", "description": "'Homeland' will end after Season 8, according to the show's star Claire Danes.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/clairedaneshomeland-fc6be6a3-22eb-47c1-99b5-bb5eeefef39a.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1", "width": 1500, "height": 900, "alt": "Claire Danes, Homeland"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-19T02:31:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T16:18:47+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "'Homeland' will end after Season 8, according to the show's star Claire Danes.", "site": "@RollingStone", "creator": "@AltheaLegaspi", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Claire Danes Says \u2018Homeland\u2019 Will End With Season 8", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/clairedaneshomeland-fc6be6a3-22eb-47c1-99b5-bb5eeefef39a.jpg?w=1500&h=900&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524105080.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
