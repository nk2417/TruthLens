Eggert was a minor, and Baio is more than 11 years older than her.\n\n\u201cHe started expressing his love for me and talking about marriage and the future,\u201d Eggert said of when she was 14 years old. According to Eggert, the sexual abuse started before her 15th birthday when \u201cwe were at his house in his car in his garage, and he reached over and penetrated me with his finger.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was very young. It was shocking,\u201d Eggert recalled. \u201cHe was playing not only on my emotions, but my hormones and all of those things.\u201d\n\nEggert pointed out the imbalanced power dynamic, noting that Baio was the boss, as the star of the show.\n\nEggert says the abuse continued from the ages of 14 to 17, which is when she and Baio \u2014 who, at the time, were often rumored to be a couple \u2014 first had sexual intercourse. Eggert admits she was a willing participant, but felt uncomfortable because she was so young.\n\n\u201cMy truth is I wasn\u2019t ready to tell my story. For me it was always protecting the show,\u201d Eggert said, defending herself from those who say she was consensually involved with Baio, and has spoken positively about him in previous interviews.\n\nBaio has insisted that Eggert was 18 years old when they first had sex, and Eggert says she was 17 years old, which would legally make her a minor in the state of California.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind,\u201d Eggert said when Kelly asked her if she was in fact a minor when she first had sexual intercourse with Baio, which she said he initiated. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a hold-me-down rape me situation, but I was 17. \u2026 I just wasn\u2019t ready to tell my story. \u2026 It was upsetting. It wasn\u2019t a good experience at all. \u2026 It was at my house in my spare bedroom, he laid down a towel and it happened there.\u201d\n\nEggert says after she and Baio had sex, his treatment of her noticeably changed. \u201cHe didn\u2019t treat me well on set after it happened. He was quite mean to me,\u201d she explained.\n\nPrior to Eggert\u2019s \u201cMegyn Kelly Today\u201d interview, the actress first accused Baio on Twitter, posting, \u201cAsk Scott Baio what happened in his garage at his house when I was a minor. Creep.\u201d\n\nSoon after, Baio defended himself on Facebook Live, saying Eggert\u2019s accusations have damaged his reputation and are impacting his family. He called Eggert\u2019s allegations \u201clies,\u201d and recalled back to the garage incident \u2014 though his side of the story is that Eggert \u201cseduced\u201d him. \u201cIf you have a real claim, you go to the real people, not social media, where people like me get beat up,\u201d Baio said in his Facebook Live video.\n\nOn \u201cMegyn Kelly Today,\u201d Eggert, seated next to her attorney Lisa Bloom, said she is exploring all legal options and is considering filing a police report.\n\nEggert\u2019s \u201cCharles in Charge\u201d castmates, Alexander Polinsky and Adam Carl, have supported the actress and have come to her defense, recalling witnessing Baio\u2019s inappropriate behavior on set.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nActor Scott Baio denies misconduct claims by former co-star\n\nDiane Keaton and Alec Baldwin are Woody Allen\u2019s loudest defenders\n\nDylan Farrow describes alleged Woody Allen assault in first TV interview\n\n.galleries:after {\n\ncontent: \u201d;\n\ndisplay: block;\n\nbackground-color: #144A7C;\n\nmargin: 16px auto 0;\n\nheight: 5px;\n\nwidth: 100px;\n\n}\n\n.galleries:before {\n\ncontent: \u201cEntertainment Photos and Video\u201d;\n\ndisplay: block;\n\nfont: 700 20px Georgia,serif;\n\ntext-align: center;\n\ncolor: #1e1e1e;\n\nvar playlist = \u2018chi_ent_movie_trailers\u2019,\n\nlayout = \u2018autoblurb\u2019,\n\niu = \u2018%2F4011%2Ftrb.chicagotribune%2Fent\u2019;\n\nWatch the latest movie trailers.", "images": ["data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2560px-Chicago_Tribune_Logo.svg-1.png", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/01/30/2M5VNZTFGZFHPHID34WVXAOYMI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2018/01/30/2M5VNZTFGZFHPHID34WVXAOYMI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elizabeth Wagmeister"], "canonical_link": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2018/01/30/nicole-eggert-details-alleged-scott-baio-sexual-abuse-with-megyn-kelly/", "title": "Nicole Eggert details alleged Scott Baio sexual abuse with Megyn Kelly", "meta_data": {"application-name": "chicagotribune", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Elizabeth Wagmeister", "canonical": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2018/01/30/nicole-eggert-details-alleged-scott-baio-sexual-abuse-with-megyn-kelly/"}, "description": "Actress Nicole Eggert, who has accused her former co-star Scott Baio of molesting her when she was a minor, revealed more details of her alleged harassment and abuse during her first television interview on Tuesday morning.
