The videos show her swinging her children\u2019s ride-on toy car around, trying to hit someone with it. At various points in the altercation, her friends hold her back. A source close to the Kardashians told E! News that they were not at all surprised to hear that Chyna had blown up.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\n\u201cNobody is surprised to see what happened,\u201d the insider said. \u201cThey are just glad Dream was not in the stroller and was safe. It\u2019s concerning that Chyna behaves this way with Dream around, but this is typical Chyna behavior.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that she can lose control of herself and rage so easily,\u201d the insider continued. \u201cThe family hopes that she will be better for Dream and will learn from this.\u201d\n\nRob Kardashian has previously alleged that Chyna had assaulted him and even tried to strangle him with an iPhone charger. She was accused of going on a rampage, destroying walls and fixtures in the house Kardashian was renting from his sister, Kylie Jenner. Chyna later said that all of her actions were in self defense.\n\nThey told Blac Chyna that her boyfriend wasn\u2019t old enough to ride the rides & she set it off at Six Flags. pic.twitter.com/oTSA1PTI2i \u2014 ronald isley (@yoyotrav) April 2, 2018\n\n\n\nA representative from Six Flags Magic Mountain spoke to the outlet as well.\n\n\u201cLast evening, a verbal and physical altercation broke out among two visiting groups,\u201d the repsaid. \u201cOur security department responded immediately and both groups were escorted out of the park. The safety and security of our guests and employees is our top priority and we have zero tolerance for this type of behavior.\u201d\n\nChyna took to her Instagram story, defending her actions without denying any of the rumors about the fight.\n\n\u201cBeing famous is hard enough dealing with scrutiny but when someone feels comfortable to come and touch your child it\u2019s a whole other story,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI do not condone violence nor am I a violent person but shout out to all of the amazing mothers out there that will protect their children at all cost. Love, King and Dreams Mommy.\u201d\n\nAn 18-year-old girl claiming to be the one on the other end of the fight emerged on Twitter. In a series of now-deleted tweets, she described the whole confrontation from her perspective.\n\n\u201c[S]ooo I was having a good little time and I see black chyna\u2019s beautiful baby right?\u201d wrote the woman. \u201cSo I\u2019m like awwwww like omg this baby is so cute (not even knowing this was her f\u2014ing baby) so I\u2019m guessing it was the nanny but she rolled the baby towards me right?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo a lady comes up to me and she\u2019s like \u2018omg was that you black Chyna was talking about?\u2019\u201d she went on. \u201c\u2018She said she was goonna whoop yo a\u2014\u2019 so now I\u2019m in tears like lmaoooo for what wtf this b\u2014 think cause she black chyna she won\u2019t get slapped.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo y\u2019all know me \u2026..
