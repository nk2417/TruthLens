Libra season was all about connecting with other people and learning from and with them, then Scorpio season was a quieter time where we focused on making our relationships more intimate and learning more about the world around us. On November 21, the Sun enters Sagittarius and kicks off Sagittarius season 2024. Over the next four weeks, you\u2019re able to take these relationships and all the things you\u2019ve learned and integrate them into yourself. You can go off and explore the world, have new experiences, and become a more well-rounded person. Fire signs Sagittarius, Aries, and Leo are shining the brightest right now, while mutable signs Gemini, Virgo, and Pisces are putting in extra work.\n\nSagittarius is the sign of higher knowledge, adventure, and wisdom. It\u2019s ruled by Jupiter, the planet of abundance, expansion, and generosity. No matter your zodiac sign, this season is an expansive time for you, because Sagittarius energy is practically obsessed with finding the capital-T truth. Your mindset is changing so that every conversation you have, person you meet, and move you make becomes an opportunity to learn, change, and grow. Sagittarius season is giving you an insatiable appetite for novelty and a voracious thirst for knowledge.\n\nIt may sound like this is a time of year where you\u2019ll be hitting the books, studying, or taking a class, but that isn\u2019t necessarily the case. This is a great time for higher education or learning about spirituality, but Sagittarius is also an extroverted fire sign, ruled by expansive, unrestrainable Jupiter. Right now, you\u2019re seeking out new things that give you a hands-on learning experience. Sagittarius is kind of like a really fun teacher. This sign loves to share their knowledge, experiment, and learn more with their pupils, instead of just preaching.\n\nThe biggest issue with this time of year is that Sagittarius energy has a bit of a \u201cknow-it-all\u201d vibe. You\u2019re identifying with the knowledge (or biases) that you\u2019ve cultivated from your life. This means that when you encounter someone from a different walk of life, a foreign culture, or just someone who has contrasting opinions, the urge to say, \u201cI know more than you\u201d is very strong. Be confident with your knowledge and take ownership over your opinions, but try not to lecture anyone! This is an opportunity for you to be generous with your knowledge and help others learn and grow. But you need to remember that there are plenty of learning experiences for you to take part in as well. Watch out for Mercury Retrograde, too\u2014it begins on November 25 and can make miscommunications and arguments a much bigger problem.\n\nFor all zodiac signs, Sagittarius season is an expansive time where you can lean into your curiosity to do more, learn more, and become more. Jupiter energy is dominating the astro weather for the next month, and you\u2019re being encouraged to shine bright by guiding others through new experiences\u2014whether it\u2019s by telling stories, teaching a new skill, or just going on an IRL adventure together. Enjoy yourself, remember to listen, and take this month to realize that nothing is mundane\u2014everything is an experience.\n\nRelated Story Your Monthly Horoscope for November Is Here\n\nRead your Sun/Rising sign horoscope for Sagittarius season 2024:\n\nAries\n\nWith the Sun floating through Sagittarius, a like-minded fire sign, you\u2019re thriving right now.
