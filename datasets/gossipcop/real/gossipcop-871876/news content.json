Fortunately, the cancer didn\u2019t spread to other parts of the body \u2013 \u201cIf that had happened it would have been all over for me\u201d \u2013 and the guitarist didn\u2019t require chemotherapy, which was good news as Wood didn\u2019t \u201cwant to lose my hair,\u201d he told Metro.\n\n\u201cIf your body is riddled with cancer, it\u2019s a losing cause. Luckily, all mine was contained within the left lung and I was fortunate enough to get shot of it, bang. There was none in the rest of my body so I didn\u2019t require chemo,\u201d Wood added, marveling that his lungs didn\u2019t \u201cexplode\u201d after smoking cigarettes for over 50 years. Wood has since quit his nicotine habit.\n\nWood also doled out some advice for those dealing with cancer. \u201cJust be strong and remain positive,\u201d he said. \u201cI was prepared to remain positive to my dying breath. I\u2019ve had a great life and I was all ready to go. Wow! I didn\u2019t know I was going to be given the ticket to last this long. What a reprieve.\u201d\n\nWith a clean bill of health, Wood will join the Rolling Stones on their upcoming European tour.", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ronnie-wood-cancer-free-2018-84e8b5ab-3067-433c-a7f2-3d3e11b8c1ad.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ronnie-wood-cancer-free-2018-84e8b5ab-3067-433c-a7f2-3d3e11b8c1ad.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Kreps", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ronnie-wood-all-clear-after-lung-cancer-scare-204881/", "title": "Ronnie Wood \u2018All Clear\u2019 After Lung Cancer Scare", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Ronnie Wood revealed in a new interview that the Rolling Stones guitarist is now cancer-free after being diagnosed with \"a touch of lung cancer.\"", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Daniel Kreps", "tags": "Ronnie Wood, The Rolling Stones", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ronnie Wood 'All Clear' After Lung Cancer Scare", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/ronnie-wood-all-clear-after-lung-cancer-scare-204881/", "description": "Ronnie Wood revealed in a new interview that the Rolling Stones guitarist is now cancer-free after being diagnosed with \"a touch of lung cancer.\"", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ronnie-wood-cancer-free-2018-84e8b5ab-3067-433c-a7f2-3d3e11b8c1ad.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "width": 1600, "height": 900, "alt": "Ronnie Wood Cancer-Free"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-28T16:01:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T15:43:46+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ronnie Wood revealed in a new interview that the Rolling Stones guitarist is now cancer-free after being diagnosed with \"a touch of lung cancer.\"", "site": "@RollingStone", "creator": "@danielkreps", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ronnie Wood \u2018All Clear\u2019 After Lung Cancer Scare", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ronnie-wood-cancer-free-2018-84e8b5ab-3067-433c-a7f2-3d3e11b8c1ad.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522252870.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
