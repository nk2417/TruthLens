Kerr later explained that she and Spiegel, 27, don\u2019t plan on showcasing their baby-to-be via Snapchat at all. \u201cOh no, No, I don\u2019t think so. What I love about Snap is you can send to your friends and family, like, you know, the little intimate moments that you\u2019re sharing. So my family in Australia, we Snap all day long.
