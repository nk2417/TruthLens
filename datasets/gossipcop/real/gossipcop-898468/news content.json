Its Dec. 7 premiere set a new benchmark for the network in Live+3 ratings with 1.708 million viewers in total viewers and 779,000 adults 18-49, ranking as Syfy\u2019s best series premiere since The Magicians in January 2016 across all key demos. In addition, the premiere opened strong on social, drawing more than 212 million impressions on Twitter.\n\n\u201cHappy! struck a chord with our Syfy audience and disrupted the TV landscape with its unique storytelling and outrageous performances led by Christopher Meloni,\u201d said Chris McCumber, President, Entertainment Networks, NBCUniversal Cable Entertainment. \u201cIf people thought this season was crazy \u2013 I can\u2019t wait for fans to see what Grant Morrison, Brian Taylor and the entire cast and crew have in store for Sax and Happy!\u201d\n\nBased on Grant Morrison and Darick Robertson\u2019s graphic novel of the same name, Happy! follows Nick Sax (Meloni) \u2013 an intoxicated, corrupt ex-cop turned hit man \u2013 who is adrift in a world of casual murder, soulless sex and betrayal. After a hit gone wrong, his inebriated life is forever changed by a tiny, relentlessly positive, imaginary blue winged horse named Happy (Oswalt). In the must-see finale, Sax and Happy are locked in a climatic confrontation to rescue Hailey (Bryce Lorenzo) from Very Bad Santa\u2019s (Joseph Reitman) lair, as Merry (Lili Mirojnick) sets out to save Amanda (Medina Senghore) from a far more powerful foe. The series also stars Ritchie Coster (Blue) and Patrick Fischler (Smoothie).\n\nHappy! is executive produced by Morrison and Brian Taylor, who co-wrote the pilot teleplay, as well as Neal Moritz, Pavun Shetty and Toby Jaffe of Original Film, Meloni and showrunner Patrick Macmanus.", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/plugins/lazy-load-0.7/images/1x1.trans.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/happy.jpg?w=807", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/happy.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/syfy-new-black-logo-featured.jpg"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/happy.jpg?w=807", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nellie Andreeva", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/01/happy-renewed-season-2-syfy-1202269250/", "title": "\u2018Happy!\u2019 Renewed For Season 2 By Syfy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Ahead of Happy!'s Season 1 finale, the quirky comedy series\u00a0starring Christopher Meloni has been renewed for a second season.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Nellie Andreeva", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Happy!\u2019 Renewed For Season 2 By Syfy", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/01/happy-renewed-season-2-syfy-1202269250/", "description": "Ahead of Happy!'s Season 1 finale, the quirky comedy series\u00a0starring Christopher Meloni has been renewed for a second season.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/happy.jpg?w=807", "width": 807, "height": 425, "alt": "Happy!"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-29T20:00:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-29T20:02:34+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Ahead of Happy!'s Season 1 finale, the quirky comedy series\u00a0starring Christopher Meloni has been renewed for a second season.", "site": "@Deadline", "creator": "@DeadlineNellie", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Happy!\u2019 Renewed For Season 2 By Syfy", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/happy.jpg?w=807"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517256025.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
