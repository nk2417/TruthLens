In the Tuesday, June 20, episode of The View, Kim Kardashian reveals that she\u2019s hopeful to heal the rift with Caitlyn Jenner over claims in the former Olympian\u2019s tell-all, The Secrets of My Life.\n\nRelated: Biggest Celebrity Family Feuds of All Time From Angelina Jolie and Jon Voight to Mackenzie and John Phillips, these famous families have had their share of public feuds\n\nIn the preview, the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 36, admits she was hurt over how the memoir portrayed her mom, Kris Jenner. \u201cI definitely got upset about it,\u201d she says. \u201cIn our family, we definitely are always so close and stick through everything, so everything is definitely going to be fine.\u201d\n\nShe adds that she was a \u201clittle shocked\u201d that Caitlyn, 67, wrote some things that \u201cweren\u2019t true or didn\u2019t really make sense\u201d in the book. \u201cAt the end of the day, my mom and Caitlyn had a 25-year relationship, and you\u2019ve gotta have some respect for it,\u201d she says. (The memoir claimed that Kris knew about Caitlyn\u2019s gender identity years before she transitioned in 2015.)\n\nRelated: Caitlyn Jenner Through the Years Caitlyn Jenner, formerly Bruce Jenner, reintroduced herself with a gorgeous Vanity Fair July cover in June 2015 -- see photos of the reality star and former Olympic athlete through the years!\n\nKardashian says she did try to understand Caitlyn\u2019s point-of-view, though. \u201cI think just maybe their stories are different, maybe their accounts are different,\u201d she continues. \u201cI don\u2019t want to discredit [Caitlyn\u2019s] feelings or her account, but when all of us were there witnessing some things and seeing some things really different, it was just a little bit surprising for me.\u201d\n\nRelated: Kim Kardashian\u2019s Best Hairstyles Ever Mane moments! Kim Kardashian has tried out a bevy of unforgettable styles and a wide range of hair colors over the years. From platinum blonde to braided hairstyles \u2014 have a look at the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star's most adventurous looks of all time.\n\nThe Selfish author says that she and Caitlyn haven\u2019t spoken \u201cin months,\u201d but the I Am Cait star has been a huge part of her life. \u201cShe\u2019ll always be my stepdad and and always be a person that raised me and taught me so much in life. [She] really stepped up to the plate and took over for my dad when he passed away, and I\u2019ll never forget what Caitlyn instilled in us as kids and was a part of who I am today, so I\u2019ll never forget that,\u201d she says. \u201cTo say I don\u2019t have a relationship, she\u2019ll always be a part of me. Have I talked to her in the last couple months? No.\u201d\n\nDespite the drama, the KKW Beauty founder hopes that the feud will end soon. \u201cWe\u2019re not that kind of family so I think we\u2019re just taking a breather. We\u2019ll get it together. We have siblings,\u201d she says of Caitlyn and Kris\u2019 daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner. \u201cIt will work out.\u201d\n\nThe full interview airs on ABC\u2019s The View Tuesday, June 20, at 11
