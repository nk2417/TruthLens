Cameran Eubanks, 33, Rose tells PEOPLE another one of the Charm-ers who helped him keep his mojo up on the journey to love was Ravenel, 54.\n\n\u201cWe had a party down at J.D. Madison\u2019s restaurant and Thomas showed up with a date and I loved introducing him to the girls. I was like, \u2018You will not believe this character. There\u2019s nobody else like him on earth.\u2019 I like Thomas for that fact. He\u2019s like a unicorn. Never a dull moment.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Will Southern Charm\u2018s Most Eligible Bachelor Shep Rose Finally Settle Down?\n\nThough Rose can\u2019t share much about the show just yet, he does admit it taught him as much about himself as it did about the women he was wooing.\n\n\u201cMy standards are unjustly high. I need to relax a little bit. It\u2019s complicated,\u201d he shares. \u201c\u2018Til death do us part\u2019 is a lot of time. And it\u2019s really a lot of time if it\u2019s a person you don\u2019t absolutely enjoy being around. I choose my friends carefully and my girlfriends, too. I like to surround myself with I can be totally comfortable and happy with and hopefully make them feel that way, too.\u201d\n\nRelationShep premieres later this year on Bravo.", "images":
