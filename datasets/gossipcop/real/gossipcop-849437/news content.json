In recent years Antonio has garnered some controversy for his political views.

In 1985, the family immigrated to the United States. Sab\u00e0to was educated at Palisades Charter High School in Los Angeles, California.\n\nModeling Career\n\nAs a model, Sab\u00e0to first gained attention in the early 1990s when he was featured on the cover of Playgirl. Later, in 1996, he became famous as an underwear model for Calvin Klein. Sab\u00e0to was represented by fashion agent Omar Albertto at that time.\n\nActing Career\n\nAfter acting in some Italian films, Sab\u00e0to achieved fame in the United States for his role as Jagger Cates on the television soap opera \"General Hospital.\" He played that character from 1992 to 1995. During that time, Sab\u00e0to starred in the television films \"Moment of Truth: Why My Daughter?\" and \"Jailbreakers.\" He also had a main role in the short-lived NBC science-fiction series \"Earth 2,\" and a recurring role on the primetime soap opera \"Melrose Place.\" Sab\u00e0to appeared in a string of television films in the latter half of the 90s, including \"Her Hidden Truth,\" \"If Looks Could Kill,\" \"Thrill,\" and \"Fatal Error.\" He also made some appearances on the big screen, notably in the action comedy \"The Big Hit.\" Additionally, Sab\u00e0to starred in the direct-to-video action film \"High Voltage\" alongside Shannon Lee and Amy Smart.\n\nKicking off the 21st century, Sab\u00e0to appeared in episodes of \"The Outer Limits\" and \"Charmed\" and in the television films \"Guilty as Charged\" and \"Final Ascent.\" In 2003, he starred as the lover of David Sutcliffe's protagonist in the drama film \"Testosterone,\" and in 2004 had a main role on the short-lived television sitcom \"The Help.\" Sab\u00e0to soon returned to soap opera acting, playing Dante Damiano on \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" from 2005 to 2006. After following that with some television films, including \"Destination: Infestation\" and \"Ghost Voyage,\" he reprised his role as Jagger Cates on \"General Hospital: Night Shift.\" Sab\u00e0to subsequently starred as John Carter in the direct-to-video science-fiction film \"Princess of Mars.\" Throughout the early 2010s, he appeared in episodes of such shows as \"CSI: NY,\" \"Rizzoli & Isles,\" and \"Bones.\" Sab\u00e0to's other notable credits have included the television miniseries \"Antonio: Down Under\" and the film \"Trail Blazers,\" which he also wrote and directed.\n\nReality Television\n\nIn addition to his acting roles, Sab\u00e0to has frequently appeared on reality television. In 2005, he competed on the VH1 competition show \"But Can They Sing?,\" coming in fifth place. Three years later, he won the NBC competition show \"Celebrity Circus.\" Following that, Sab\u00e0to starred on his own VH1 reality show, \"My Antonio,\" featuring female contestants competing to win his heart. The winner of the show was Brooke Barlow. Sab\u00e0to went on to appear on \"Celebrity Wife Swap\" alongside his family in early 2012. On the show, his then-fianc\u00e9 Cheryl Nunes swapped places with Colette Foley, the wife of WWE wrestler Mick Foley.

Ultimately, Brownley trounced him in the general election.\n\nSab\u00e0to has been controversial for his political remarks. Most infamously, he made racist statements about Barack Obama, perpetuating the falsehood that the former US president is Muslim.\n\nSab\u00e0to endorsed Donald Trump in 2016. He garnered more pushback when he compared his struggle of finding work in show business to being Jewish during the Holocaust.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn 1992, Sab\u00e0to married model and actress Alicia Tully Jensen. The pair divorced the following year, when Sab\u00e0to began dating actress Virginia Madsen. That relationship lasted until 1998, and produced a son.

Sab\u00e0to confirmed he was addicted to sleep aids.\n\nIn 2020, Sab\u00e0to moved with his family from California to Florida to be somewhere more in line with his views and after claiming he had been blacklisted by Hollywood. In the Sunshine State, he works for a construction company.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn April 2005 Antonio paid $1.453 million for a home in Thousand Oaks, California.
