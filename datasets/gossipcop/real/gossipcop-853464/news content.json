Benett/Getty Images)\n\nPippa Middleton attends the wedding of Katie Percy to Patrick Valentine at St Michael's Church in Alnwick, Northumberland on February 26, 2011 in Alnwick, England\n\nPippa Middleton isn't exactly the style icon her big sister is.\n\nKate Middleton, Britain's Duchess of Cambridge, is one of the best dressed women in the world, crediting with reinvigorating life into the British fashion industry and winning praise for mixing high end Alexander McQueen gowns with jewellery from Zara. Pippa, on the other hand, recently wore this to a wedding in Cork.\n\nPippa Middleton and her husband James Matthews in Glengarriff last summer\n\nThe more private Middleton sister was also thrust into the spotlight when her sister's relationship with Prince William went public in 2005 and in 2008, she began being pictured alongside her sister, as well as on her own. Her undeniable beauty and penchant for socialising meant she was a more accessible Kate and gave us countless iconic looks which sum up the noughties for all of us.\n\n2006\n\nWe were first introduced to her walking arm in arm with Kate at Cheltenham in 2006, wearing a suede boot with a kitten heel we could all approve of.\n\n(L-R) Pippa Middleton and Prince William's girlfriend Kate Middleton, wearing a Russian-style fur hat, attend the final day of Cheltenham Races on March 17, 2006 in Cheltenham, England. (Photo by Tim Graham/Getty Images)\n\n2007\n\nIn 2007, we were treated to two different looks from the then 24-year-old; both with Kate, whose pre-royal wedding style is truly something to behold. At a book launch for The Young Stalin: The Adventurous Early Life Of The Dictator 1878-1917, an event we would never see either at these days, her yellow silk Orla Kiely print dress is only overshadowed by her modest patent heel (with round toe) and black bolero.\n\nPippa and Kate Middleton (R) attend the book launch party of The Young Stalin: The Adventurous Early Life Of The Dictator 1878-1917 by Simon Sebag Montefiore, at Asprey May 14, 2007 in London, England. (Photo by Dave M. Benett/Getty Images)\n\nFor a more low-key look, we see her in a pair of too-long-for-her-legs-but-also-impossibly-on-trend flared jeans wrapped under a cosy looking coat, joined by Kate who mastered English country chic from a very early age.\n\nKate Middleton With Sister Pippa At Windsor After Watching Prince William Play Rugby.. (Photo by Antony Jones/UK Press via Getty Images)\n\n2008\n\nAfter a taste of the limelight, Pippa comes out of her shell with four truly glorious public appearances. Her fondness for boleros and patent shoes shows no waning at a Sotheby's bash in London.\n\nPippa Middleton attends the Sotheby's Summer Party, at Sotheby's Bond Street on June 19, 2008 in London, England. (Photo by Dave M.

(Photo by Chris Jackson/Getty Images)\n\nWe are treated to this absolutely delightful number.\n\nSocialite Pippa Middleton attends the 10th anniversary party of Claridge's Bar November 11, 2008 in London, England. (Photo by Dave M. Benett/Getty Images)\n\nAnd most importantly, not to be overshadowed by the future queen, Pippa wasn't far behind Kate during their now-infamous roller disco night.\n\nPhilippa \"Pippa\" Middleton attends the Day-Glo Midnight Roller Disco to raise money for Tom's Ward at Oxford Children's Hospital, The Renaissance Rooms, SW8 September 17, 2008 in London, England. (Photo by Danny Martindale/Getty Images)\n\n2011\n\nAfter a brief sojourn from public life, she is back to it in the run up to the royal wedding. Here she is practicing blending in at a friend's wedding.\n\nPippa Middleton, the sister of Kate Middleton, fiancee of Britain's Prince William, arrives for the wedding service of Lady Katie Percy, the eldest daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland in Alnwick, north-east England, on February 26, 2011\n\nThis lime green sateen coat dress will go down in history books.\n\nSisters Kate and Pippa Middleton in 2011\n\nHer more tailored style becomes apparent in this sundress.\n\nPippa Middleton shops on June 23, 2011 in London, England.\n\nBut not before one final faded denim with blush pink bag.\n\nPippa Middleton sighted leaving an office in Kensington on May 19, 2011 in London, England. (Photo by Neil Mockford/FilmMagic)\n\nThat was all just before this moment, when the world as Pippa knew it would never be the same again.\n\nThe 'rear of the year' at her sister's wedding in 2011",
