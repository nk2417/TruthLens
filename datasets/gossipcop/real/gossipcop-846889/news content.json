A bowl of my fav Well Yes! soup\u2026Minestrone with Kale. Check them out in your local grocery store. #ad #wellyesmoment #campbells @campbellswellyes A post shared by Busy Philipps (@busyphilipps) on Jan 24, 2017 at 10:09am PST\n\nIt is common for celebrities to promote brands on the photo-sharing site. Stars like Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, Lea Michele, Bella Hadid and more have gotten in on the action.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not above it, guys,\u201d Philipps said in the clip. \u201cI just only choose things that I genuinely like and, like, would want to partner with, like, for instance, my Michaels partnership, which, you know, is my favorite thing of all time. And I\u2019m doing one next week, I think, that feels like me.\u201d\n\nBusy Philipps Describes Her \u2018Freaking Creepy\u2019 Uber Scare\n\nThe mother-of-two\u2018s Instagram account has several posts promoting the arts and crafts retail chain along with Campbell\u2019s Soup and more.\n\nHowever, she noted in the video that she likely wouldn\u2019t promote a product that she deemed \u201crandom and weird\u201d \u2014 \u201cUnless it was, like, a billion dollars.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna sell things,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s my only point.\u201d\n\nPhilipps currently plays Gale Liptrapp in HBO\u2019s Vice Principals and last year made appearances on New Girl and Angie Tribeca.", "images":
