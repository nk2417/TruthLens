I think she\u2019s feisty as ever,\u201d Gillies said.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nHere are 10 more things we learned about The CW\u2019s \u201cDynasty\u201d reboot:\n\n1. More original characters will appear in The CW series \u2014 including Alexis.\n\nAside from the core cast, based on the original \u201cDynasty\u201d characters, the team plans to bring back some more familiar faces, namely Alexis, who was originally played by Joan Collins.\n\n\u201cAll in due time,\u201d Schwartz teased, before Patrick confirmed that you will see Alexis during the first season, though she didn\u2019t say who will be cast in the iconic role. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet,\u201d Patrick said of the Alexis casting. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see if it works out.\u201d\n\nEven before Alexis shows up on screen, the character\u2019s presence will be felt throughout the episodes. \u201cWe do refer to her a lot,\u201d Schwartz said to which Patrick added, \u201cWe\u2019re building up the spirit of Alexis. She\u2019s definitely there in the other characters.\u201d\n\n2. The original \u201cDynasty\u201d was homophobic. The CW version will be far from that.\n\nBlake Carrington\u2019s (Show) son, Steven (James Mackay), is gay and he\u2019ll be out-and-proud.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between Blake and Steven is not about sexuality. Steven is confidently gay, Blake accepts him,\u201d Schwartz said, explaining that the father-son duo will instead fight about other things like \u201cenvironmental causes.\u201d\n\n3. Today\u2019s politics will make the 2017 \u201cDynasty\u201d more relevant than the original.\n\nWhen asked about President Donald Trump\u2019s power and wealth and how that may influence the show, Schwartz said the series\u2019 influence is bigger than Trump.\n\n\u201cWe are definitely living in an age of dynasties,\u201d he said. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the Trumps or the Clintons or the Kardashians or the Murdochs, our news is filled with the worlds of family dynasties and that was exciting for us.\u201d\n\n4. The spelling of Crystal\u2019s name (rather than Krystle, like the original character) has a lot of meaning behind it.\n\nActress Nathalie Kelley, who\u2019s from Peru, portrays the character that was originally played by Linda Evans. But in the new and updated series, Crystal is Latina and from Venezuela.\n\n\u201cThis modern version represents a more current picture of what\u2019s happening in America. The diversity of the cast really represents that,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cTo weave that into the narrative of \u2018Dynasty\u2019 is really exciting and important to talk about the geo-politics of Venezuela on a CW show.\u201d\n\n5. This version of \u201cDynasty\u201d will focus on powerful and ambitious women.\n\nThe two female central stars, Gillies and Kelley, will both portray career-hungry women, who are fighting for power of the family company.\n\n\u201cBoth of these women are ambitious career women \u2026 they want to run this business,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cHaving Crystal have a more senior role in the company, not just being the secretary, makes her more credible of vying for control of this company with Fallon.\u201d\n\nSavage said that the original show \u201creally found itself\u201d when the two women started sparring against each other, though in the \u201980s series, their catfights were over a man, rather than a business.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re competitive, they\u2019re both smart, they\u2019re ambitious. You have the great head-to-head and [we\u2019re] kicking it off with that great catfight,\u201d Savage teased of the pilot episode.\n\n6. Speaking of fight scenes, don\u2019t think they promote woman-on-woman hate.\n\nKelley joked that at first, she and Gillies were uncomfortable with physical fighting and wanted to work out their characters\u2019 disagreements \u201cthrough words.\u201d But then, the actress realized there was a gender inequality issue with on-screen catfights.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s how I justify it \u2014 if modern women today are fighting rightfully so for equal pay,\u201d Kelley began, \u201cWhy can\u2019t we also have the right to fight with men? Why should we be less feminine or less as women when we fight? That\u2019s my feminist take on why we pull each other\u2019s hair out!\u201d\n\n7. The new \u201cDynasty\u201d is based in Atlanta, while the original was set in Denver.\n\n\u201cIt felt like Atlanta was a realistic location of this family to be based out of,\u201d Schwartz said, sharing that when he met with the Shapiros, they weren\u2019t wedded to the location of Denver. \u201cThey kind of randomly picked it off of a map,\u201d he said of the original location. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel like an issue that was integral to them creatively in the beginning.\u201d\n\n8. The show will include comedic undertones.\n\n\u201cWe have a really funny cast so we wanted to be able to write toward that,\u201d Schwartz said, assuring the room of reporters and critics that the catfights would be balanced with comedy.\n\n9. The fashion will still be a centerpiece of the 2017 primetime soap.\n\nMeredith Markworth-Pollack, who was the designer on The CW\u2019s \u201cReign\u201d and was an assistant to the designer on \u201cGossip Girl,\u201d is in charge of the clothes on \u201cDynasty.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s great with being in touch with new trends,\u201d Savage raved of Markworth-Pollack, also teasing some \u201creally fun themed parties coming up and things that are really dramatic and more costumey.\u201d\n\n10. Like the original, The CW version will stay true to family.\n\n\u201cWhen we first sat down with the Shapiros to talk about rebooting the show, they talked a lot about family. No matter the villainous things that they did, they never stopped loving each other,\u201d Savage said of meeting with original \u201cDynasty\u201d creators Richard and Esther Shapiro, who are executive producers on The CW show. \u201cI think we took that core concept and then just talked about how to place the idea in the historical context of our day.\u201d\n\nWhile the concept of core family will remain, the subject matter of their fights will change to adapt to modern times.\n\n\u201cWhat are the conversations people are having about politics, about culture, about climate change? There\u2019s so much going on, and we felt like the show could really be part of those conversations,\u201d Savage explained. Schwartz added, \u201cIt\u2019s really important for us for our show to meet this moment in time just like the original did in the \u201980s.\u201d\n\nGrant show, who plays Blake Carrington in The CW\u2019s \u201cDynasty,\u201d is best known for his starring role on the original \u201cMelrose Place.\u201d When asked if executive producer Aaron Spelling would have given his stamp of approval on the new \u201cDynasty,\u201d he said, \u201cabsolutely.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he would love it,\u201d Show said. \u201cOne thing that Aaron always said was that his stories were about characters, were about people, and that\u2019s what this story is about.\u201d", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dynasty-tca.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dynasty-tca.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elizabeth Wagmeister", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/dynasty-reboot-cw-different-from-original-1202513560/", "title": "10 Ways CW\u2019s \u2018Dynasty\u2019 Reboot Will Be Different From the Original", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"Dynasty\" is coming back to television in the form of a younger, sexier, sassier CW series.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Elizabeth Wagmeister", "tags": "Dynasty, Josh Schwartz, Stephanie Savage, TCA, The Cw", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "10 Ways CW\u2019s \u2018Dynasty\u2019 Reboot Will Be Different From the Original", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/dynasty-reboot-cw-different-from-original-1202513560/", "description": "\"Dynasty\" is coming back to television in the form of a younger, sexier, sassier CW series.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dynasty-tca.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Dynasty"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-02T19:55:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-03T17:30:55+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"Dynasty\" is coming back to television in the form of a younger, sexier, sassier CW series.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@EWagmeister", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "10 Ways CW\u2019s \u2018Dynasty\u2019 Reboot Will Be Different From the Original", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/dynasty-tca.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501703704.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
