(Don't get me wrong, I realize that other players had fun with this challenge, but Cody \u2014 with those wide eyes and that megawatt smile \u2014 just seemed to enjoy it a little too much.)\n\nClues based on previous challenges led the teams to their final destination, with Team Yale arriving first, followed by Teams Big Brother and Extreme \u2014 which meant, sadly, Alex and Conor had to pump the brakes on their Amazing Race journey. (And if you think that was a bad race-car driving pun, you should check out The Bachelor sometime.)\n\nAnd things only became more difficult when the final three teams traveled to San Francisco, where their kayaking and bridge-climbing skills were put to the test \u2014 not to mention their patience, as several players lost their cool and snapped at their well-meaning teammates.\n\nFollowing a cookie-making challenge \u2014 which was not as fun as it sounds \u2014 the teams had to run all over a military ship, collecting pieces to build a damn airplane that would land on the Official Amazing Race Winners' Mat\u2122. Host Phil Keoghan wasn't kidding when he warned that this would be the most challenging physical and mental challenge yet.\n\nIn the end, it was Team Big Brother that finished first, making Cody Nickson and Jessica Graf the winners of The Amazing Race Season 30.
