Meanwhile, new parents Brie Bella and Daniel Bryan navigate balancing work obligations with being home for their daughter\u2019s \u201cfirsts.\u201d Between wedding preparations and motherhood, the Bella Twins also continue to build their brand and expand their business ventures, all while planning their long-awaited WWE comeback.\n\nAt the start of the third installment of the reality series, Brie Bella decides that she wants to join her sister and John Cena in San Diego, but faces resistance from her husband, Daniel Bryan, who is not interested in moving.\n\nAs the wedding creeps closer and plans are being finalized, thinking about the future forces Nikki and John to have a truly honest conversation about major life decisions that they don\u2019t see eye to eye on (namely, having kids). Meanwhile after two years of extensive evaluations, Daniel Bryan gets the exciting news he has been waiting for; he is cleared by WWE to return to in-ring competition.\n\n\u201cThe Bella Twins are exemplary of the strong, inspiring women that resonate with our audience,\u201d said Amy Introcaso-Davis, E!s Executive Vice President of Development and Production. \u201cE! has been there for the most pivotal moments in the Bella Twins\u2019 lives and we are thrilled to continue following Nikki and Brie\u2019s thriving careers, and all the heartwarming moments in their personal lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cTotal Bellas\u201d is executive produced by Kevin Dunn for WWE, with Gil Goldschein, Russell Jay and Farnaz Farjam Chazan executive producing under the Bunim/Murray Productions banner. Nikki Bella and Brie Bella also have executive producing credits.\n\nWatch the trailer above.\n\n\u201cTotal Bellas\u201d Season 3 premieres on May 20 at 9/8 c on E!", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?fit=53%2C58&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5x4_082025_COVER.jpg?fit=240%2C300&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/John-Cena-Nikki-Bella-Total-Bellas-1.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas.jpeg?resize=150%2C150&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/John-Cena-Nikki-Bella-Total-Bellas-1.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Maas", "Tv Reporter", "Jennifer.Maas Thewrap.Com", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/total-bellas-wwe-season-3-premiere-date-trailer-john-cena-nikki-bella-video/", "title": "\u2018Total Bellas\u2019 Sets Season 3 Premiere Date, (Elbow) Drops Trailer Drenched in John Cena\u2019s Tears (Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Total Bellas' Sets Season 3 Premiere Date, (Elbow) Drops Trailer Drenched in John Cena's Tears (Video)", "description": "First Family of WWE will return to E! next month with more drama than ever", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/total-bellas-wwe-season-3-premiere-date-trailer-john-cena-nikki-bella-video/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/John-Cena-Nikki-Bella-Total-Bellas-1.png?fit=618%2C412&quality=80&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/png"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2018-04-05T15:31:43+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-05T15:35:10+00:00"}, "author": "Jennifer Maas", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Jennifer Maas", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "brie-bella, daniel-bryan, john-cena, nikki-bella, total-bellas", "article-section": "tv", "article-categories": "culture, tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522942303.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
