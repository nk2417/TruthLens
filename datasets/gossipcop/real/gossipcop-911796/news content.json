She is known for being the younger sister of Britney Spears and an actress. Spears began her career as a child actress on All That and had her breakthrough role when she played Zoey Brooks on the Nickelodeon teen sitcom Zoey 101 (2005\u20132008);[2] she later reprised this role in the sequel film Zoey 102 (2023). She plays Noreen Fitzgibbons on the Netflix romantic drama series Sweet Magnolias (2020\u2013present). She is the recipient of several accolades, including a Gracie Award, two Kids Choice Awards and two Young Artist Awards.\n\nBeginning in December 2007, Spears was subject to significant media attention and controversy after announcing her pregnancy at age 16. A misconception emerged that this canceled Zoey 101; however, the final season wrapped filming on August 10, 2007 and premiered the following year. After giving birth in June 2008, Spears stopped acting for five years.[3]\n\nSpears returned from her hiatus in 2013 and began her music career. She released her debut single \"How Could I Want More\" from her debut EP in country music, The Journey (2014). Spears also co-wrote Jana Kramer's platinum certified 2015 single, \"I Got the Boy\".[4]\n\nIn 2023, due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, Spears appeared on reality television shows, such as Dancing with the Stars, Special Forces: World's Toughest Test and I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!.[5][6]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nSpears was born in McComb, Mississippi,[7] and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana.[1] She is the youngest child of Lynne Irene (n\u00e9e Bridges) and James \"Jamie\" Parnell Spears. She has two older siblings, Bryan and Britney.[8] Her parents divorced in 2002, but were in an on-and-off relationship after the divorce.[9] She has described her home life as unstable, but remembers \"feeling very loved\".[9] She attended Parklane Academy in McComb, where she was a cheerleader, and point guard of the basketball team.[10] She was enrolled in dance and voice lessons, and participated in school plays and church performances.[11] As a child, Spears and her family also spent time traveling and touring with her sister Britney.[12]\n\nSpears studied with tutors while filming Zoey 101 in Los Angeles.[13] She finished her education via online correspondence[14] and received her GED in February 2008 through Tangipahoa Parish School System Adult Education Center.[15]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\n2002\u20132008: Career beginnings and success with All That and Zoey 101 [ edit ]\n\nIn February 2002, at age 10, Spears made her acting debut in the Paramount Pictures drama film Crossroads which starred her sister, who portrayed the central character Lucy Wagner. Spears made a cameo, playing the younger version of Britney's character.[16] In April 2002, Spears walked the runway as a model for Kids R Us fashion show in New York City.[17] Following Crossroads, Nickelodeon cast Spears as a regular performer in the sketch comedy series All That for the 2002 season; she appeared on the show through 2004.[18] Spears portrayed various roles through the two seasons she appeared.[19] Along with the cast of All That, Spears also made appearances on Snick On-Air Dare, Nickelodeon's version of Fear Factor.[20] Deciding to pursue other roles on the network, Spears departed from the main cast on the tenth and final season of All That, and only appeared as a guest. At age 13, Spears was named as one of the celebrities on Teen People's Young Hollywood/Hot List.[17]\n\nSpears in 2007\n\nIn August 2004, Spears signed a development deal with Nickelodeon in which she would star as the protagonist in her own scripted television series that would air on the network. The series went on to be titled Zoey 101 and Spears portrayed the role of Zoey Brooks. The series centered on Zoey and her friends who attend a fictional boarding school, Pacific Coast Academy (PCA). Spears recorded the series theme song, titled \"Follow Me\", which was written by her sister Britney Spears. Filmed at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, the series premiered on January 9, 2005, and was the network's highest-rated series premiere in over eight years. Spears won a Young Artist Award and a Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards for her performance.[21] In September 2007, she won \"The High School Sweetheart\" award at Us Weekly's Hot Hollywood event.[22][23][24]\n\nZoey 101 was positively received by critics and viewers.[19] It was nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Children's Programming, and the show's season 3 finale episode was the second most-watched show across all cable channels that week.[19] The series ran for four seasons, with its series finale \"PCA Confidential\" airing on May 2, 2008. Nickelodeon issued a statement shortly after the announcement of Spears being pregnant at the age of 16, stating that the network respected Spears's decision to take responsibility and noting that its primary concern was for her well-being.[25][26] Spears' co-star Sean Flynn praised her as hard-working and talented, telling Nylon: \"One of the things that always stood out to me regarding her professionalism was how well she knew her lines. I don\u2019t think she ever messed one up. She always brought her best work to the table.\"[19]\n\nIn December 2007, Variety announced that Spears had signed on to guest-appear in the ABC comedy sitcom series Miss Guided, in which she played the role of the promiscuous high-school student Mandy Fener in the episode \"Hot Sub\" which aired on March 20, 2008.

She was the second contestant to depart on medical grounds that season, as Grace Dent left days earlier.[75][76]\n\nPublic image [ edit ]\n\nIn the early years of her career, Spears had a generally wholesome image as a teen star.[8] Her fame increased dramatically in the wake of her pregnancy announcement in December 2007, and during the following months, she became a frequent target of the paparazzi. In subsequent years, Spears was rarely seen in the public eye and focused on family, saying: \"I used to be insecure at times, because I was always the youngest mom in the room. I quickly learned that being a good and competent mother has nothing to do with age.\"[77]\n\nSpears has been featured in several fashion blogs and magazines such as Nylon,[19] Seventeen, Teen Vogue, CosmoGirl, Teen People, Teen, Girls' Life, Mizz and Nickelodeon Magazine.[78] Spears has appeared in commercials and print ads throughout her career.

She underwent therapy and briefly used medication as well. \"The anxiety was to the point where I couldn't function,\" she commented.[9] \"I'm very conscious not to lie to myself anymore because I think that my biggest issue my whole life was pretending to be perfect.\"[9]\n\nTeenage pregnancy [ edit ]\n\nOn December 20, 2007, in an interview with OK! magazine, Spears announced that she was pregnant by her then boyfriend, Casey Aldridge.[92] She was 16 years old at the time. Aldridge, whom she had been dating for two years, was 18.[93] Spears confirmed her engagement to Aldridge in March 2008.[94] In May 2008, the couple moved to Liberty, Mississippi, and purchased a house, with Spears stating they would raise their child there.[95] She gave birth to their daughter Maddie Briann Aldridge on June 19, 2008, in McComb, Mississippi.[96][97][98] Spears and Aldridge ended their engagement in March 2009,[99][100] and Spears moved out in December 2009.[101] The couple reconciled in August 2010,[102] but ended their relationship a second time in November 2010.[103]\n\nThe announcement of Spears' pregnancy generated controversy, with criticism centering on the story purportedly glamorizing teenage pregnancy.[104][105] Some teens were disappointed with the contrast between Spears' on-screen personality as a \"good girl\" and her real-life teen pregnancy.[106]\n\nOn June 4, 2008, while in Amite County, Mississippi, the Spears family filed a complaint against Edwin Merrino, a paparazzo who, they believed, was stalking the couple. Merrino denied the allegation. He was released later in the day after posting bond.[107]\n\nAfter her daughter's birth, Spears disappeared from the public eye for five years, focusing on raising her child.[108] In an interview with Nylon, Spears said: \"So, I got me a little house. I put a big gate up around it, and I was like, 'I'm going to stay here, raise my baby, and figure this out because this is real life. I've put myself in this situation, I'm not condoning it or saying it's right, but these are the cards that I have to play.' And I tried to do the best that I could.\"[10]\n\nMarriage and family [ edit ]\n\nShe subsequently began a relationship with Jamie Watson, a businessman who owns the communications service Advanced Media Partners. After two years of on-and-off dating, they announced their engagement in March 2013.[109][110] On March 14, 2014, she married Watson in New Orleans.[111] On April 11, 2018, Spears gave birth to her second daughter.[112][113]\n\nATV incident [ edit ]\n\nOn February 5, 2017, Spears' eight-year-old daughter Maddie almost drowned in a Polaris ATV accident, after accidentally driving into the pond on her stepfather and mother's Louisiana property, with the ATV flipping over upon impact. She was later airlifted to Children's Hospital of New Orleans, where she remained unconscious in a coma for two days. She woke up and was released from care on February 10.[114] Police reported the incident as occurring before 3:00 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon, and the sheriff explained that she was steering \"100 yards from her parents\" when she took \"a hard right to avoid running over a nearby drainage ditch\". The police report stated, \"The child was trapped and secured by the seatbelt and the ATV's safety netting. Within two minutes, Acadian Ambulance Services arrived and assisted in freeing the child from the cold waters.\"[115]\n\nIn 2020, Spears explained the situation further. She elaborated that she and her husband Jamie Watson \"[...] dove in and [...] were able to rescue her,\" then the first responder took her away. The firefighter was able to get a pulse, but her case looked \"grim at the time\", leading to her being airlifted to the hospital.[116][117]\n\nFeud with Britney Spears [ edit ]\n\nIn 2021, Jamie Lynn and her sister Britney were involved in a highly publicized feud via social media. Britney publicly accused Jamie Lynn of actively and knowingly being involved in her conservatorship, while not making any efforts to help her terminate it. Jamie Lynn denied the allegations and maintained that she was unaware of the details of the conservatorship. Britney threatened legal action against Jamie Lynn after the latter spoke extensively about Britney in both her book and the following promotional tour.[118]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nExtended plays [ edit ]\n\nSingles [ edit ]\n\nOther appearances [ edit ]\n\nMusic videos [ edit ]\n\nAwards and nominations [ edit ]\n\nPublished works [ edit ]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2023_Interview_2.jpg/250px-Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2023_Interview_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/16/Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2011.png/150px-Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2011.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/76/Jamie_Lynn_Spears_Zoey_102_Trailer.png/250px-Jamie_Lynn_Spears_Zoey_102_Trailer.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3d/Jamie_Lynn_Spears.jpg/250px-Jamie_Lynn_Spears.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/40px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b7/Pending-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Pending-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2023_Interview_2.jpg/866px-Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2023_Interview_2.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/20px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Jamie_Lynn_Spears_%26_daughter_on_Double_Dare.jpg/330px-Jamie_Lynn_Spears_%26_daughter_on_Double_Dare.jpg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2023_Interview_2.jpg/866px-Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2023_Interview_2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Lynn_Spears", "title": "Jamie Lynn Spears", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2023_Interview_2.jpg/866px-Jamie_Lynn_Spears_2023_Interview_2.jpg", "width": 866, "height": 1200}, "title": "Jamie Lynn Spears - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
