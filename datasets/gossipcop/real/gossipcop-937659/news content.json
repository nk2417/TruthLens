Raver first played Teddy Altman in season 6 as a main cast member and left in the season 8 finale, having returned for a multi-episode arc during season 14.\n\n\u201cI am thrilled to reprise the role of Dr. Teddy Altman as a regular,\u201d Raver told Variety. \u201cReturning to Shondaland with the incredibly talented Krista Vernoff, Ellen Pompeo and the amazing cast is heavenly. I have a special place in my heart for Teddy and feel very lucky to have the opportunity to continue her story.\u201d\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\nRaver\u2019s return means she\u2019s staying with ABC after appearing in a recurring role in season 2 of ABC\u2019s Designated Survivor, which was recently canceled after two seasons.\n\nHer return to Grey\u2019s Anatomy comes on the heels of the exits of Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew at the conclusion of season 14. It also means fans will see a resolution after Raver\u2019s character Teddy returned with a shocking pregnancy twist after mysteriously arriving from Germany in the season 14 finale.\n\nTeddy reveals she came back to Seattle to ask if there was a job opening at Grey Sloan Memorial. Bailey (Chandra Wilson) tells Teddy that her coming to Seattle for a job is one more sign that she should take some time for herself, which leads to her announcing she\u2019s taking a sabbatical from being Chief of Surgery.\n\nShe says she takes the necessary steps to ensure she will have a long life despite her health scare, but she hasn\u2019t really done anything or changed her life since then.\n\nBailey shares she wants to stop listening to the voice of the patriarchy telling her she can\u2019t pause and offers Teddy the job of Interim Chief of Surgery.\n\n\u201cI want to take a sabbatical from stress,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cI want to do research\u2026 and fall in love with the O.R. again. I want to spend time with the people that I love. I want to watch TED talks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love my job so it\u2019s temporary, but what do you say?\u201d Bailey asks.\n\n\u201cI say, let\u2019s keep talking.\u201d Teddy says.\n\nDuring the final minutes of the show, Teddy watches a livestream of her patient\u2019s daughter\u2019s wedding and gets very emotional. The patient reaches for Teddy\u2019s hand and notices she\u2019s rubbing her stomach.\n\n\u201cAre you expecting?\u201d she asks.\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Teddy announces, seemingly suggesting that Owen (Kevin McKidd) is going to be a father.\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy will return for its 15th season in fall 2018.", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/06/netflix-logo.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/billy-ray-cyrus-elizabeth-hurley-2.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/the-real-housewives-of-orange-county-logo-1.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/08/32a08016-72b7-41f8-b593-df0f660db84e.png?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": [".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/tv-shows/news/greys-anatomy-makes-kim-raver-a-series-regular-for-season-15/", "title": "\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Welcomes Kim Raver as Series Regular for Season 15", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Welcomes Kim Raver as Series Regular for Season 15", "description": "Grey\u2019s Anatomy is bringing back Kim Raver as a series regular for its upcoming 15th season.
