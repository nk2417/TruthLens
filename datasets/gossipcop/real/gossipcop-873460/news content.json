Martinez and the jury for their careful consideration, my attorneys Doug Baldridge, Danielle Foley, Jay Schaudies and Katie Wright for fighting for me and anyone who feels silenced by a sexual assault, and especially anyone who offered their support throughout this four-year ordeal and two-year long trial process,\u201d the 27-year-old singer said in a statement.\n\n\u201cI acknowledge the privilege that I benefit from in life, in society and in my ability to shoulder the enormous cost of defending myself in a trial like this,\u201d she continued. \u201cMy hope is to help those whose voices should also be heard. Therefore, I will be making donations in the near future to multiple organizations that help sexual assault victims defend themselves.\"\n\nOutside the courthouse, Baldridge told reporters that he was \u201cdelighted\u201d with the jury\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cIt takes wonderful people like Taylor to stand up and draw these lines,\u201d he said.\n\nMueller, who has denied the claims, filed a $3 million suit against the singer in September 2015, claiming she cost him his job and future career opportunities. Swift countersued Mueller for $1, accusing him of assault and battery. In addition to finding that Swift's mother, Andrea Swift, and her radio promotions director, Frank Bell, did not intentionally interfere with Mueller's contract, the jury also ruled that Swift be awarded the symbolic dollar.\n\n\u201cThat dollar is a single dollar and it is of immeasurable value,\u201d Baldridge told press.\n\n\n\nNEWS: Jury Rules in Favor of Taylor Swift in Alleged Groping Lawsuit\n\nSee more on the case below.\n\nReporting by Sophie Schillaci and Tracie De La Rosa.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/taytaycourtday_1280_hulu.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/taytaycourtday_1280_hulu.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/223772_taylor_swift_speaks_out_after_lawsuit_victory_my_hope_is_to_help_those_whose_voices_should_also_be_heard", "title": "Taylor Swift Speaks Out After Lawsuit Victory: 'My Hope Is to Help Those Whose Voices Should Also Be Heard'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/taytaycourtday_1280_hulu.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The singer plans to donate money to help victims of sexual assault 'defend themselves.'", "title": "Taylor Swift Speaks Out After Lawsuit Victory: 'My Hope Is to Help Those Whose Voices Should Also Be Heard'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/223772_taylor_swift_speaks_out_after_lawsuit_victory_my_hope_is_to_help_those_whose_voices_should_also_be_heard", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The singer plans to donate money to help victims of sexual assault 'defend themselves.'", "twitter": {"description": "The singer plans to donate money to help victims of sexual assault 'defend themselves.'", "title": "Taylor Swift Speaks Out After Lawsuit Victory: 'My Hope Is to Help Those Whose Voices Should Also Be Heard'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/223772_taylor_swift_speaks_out_after_lawsuit_victory_my_hope_is_to_help_those_whose_voices_should_also_be_heard", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/taytaycourtday_1280_hulu.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Taylor Swift Speaks Out After Lawsuit Victory: 'My Hope Is to Help Those Whose Voices Should Also Be Heard' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Taylor Swift", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
