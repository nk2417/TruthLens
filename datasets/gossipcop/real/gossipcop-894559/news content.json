{"url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/transparent-star-alleges-jeffrey-tambor-sexually-harassed-her-got-physical-1059306", "text": "In the second season of Transparent, the groundbreaking Amazon series that traces one father\u2019s journey to womanhood, Maura Pfefferman \u2014 played by Jeffrey Tambor, in a role that has won him two Emmys \u2014 struggles to find the right inflection for the popular queer catchphrase, \u201cYas queen.\u201d\n\nHer teacher is Shea \u2014 played by Trace Lysette \u2014 a yoga teacher and sometimes stripper, who steps in to show her fellow transgender, a newbie, the ropes.\n\nThe moment, which went viral shortly after the season debuted in November 2015, plays out as sweet, hilarious and authentic. But Lysette now says the circumstances around its filming were anything but.\n\nAccording to Lysette, when she emerged from wardrobe in her costume \u2014 a salmon-colored lingerie top and matching short-shorts \u2014 Tambor remarked, \u201cMy God, Trace. I want to attack you sexually.\u201d Alexandra Billings, the third actor in the scene, was present to hear the remark, she confirms. Both \u201claughed it off because it was so absurd,\u201d Lysette says.\n\nA few minutes later, while waiting for a camera setup between takes, Lysette was standing in a corner of the soundstage set. That\u2019s when she says Tambor, dressed as Maura, wearing a green satin kimono and gray wig, approached her.\n\n\u201cHe came in close, put his bare feet on top of mine so I could not move, leaned his body against me, and began quick, discreet thrust back and forth against my body. I felt his penis on my hip through his thin pajamas,\u201d Lysette says.\n\nLysette pushed Tambor away and \u201crolled my eyes.\u201d Billings was not present for this alleged incident, and several crewmembers were nearby \u201cbut they were focused on their jobs. It was discreet. If you were behind Jeffrey you might have thought he was giving me a hug.\u201d\n\nThe actress, who is transgender, is the second on the Transparent payroll to come forward with allegations that Tambor, 73, has subjected them to sexual harassment, sexual assault and generally abusive behavior on the set of the critically adored series.\n\nThe first accuser, Van Barnes, is a trans woman who worked as Tambor\u2019s personal assistant, and whose allegations have led to an internal investigation by Amazon Studios. She has previously appeared on E!\u2019s I Am Cait.\n\nAccording to Barnes\u2019 lawyer Alana Chazan, her client signed a nondisclosure agreement while working for Tambor and therefore could not comment on Lysette\u2019s claims. Nor would Barnes detail what workplace abuses she allegedly suffered at Tambor\u2019s hands \u2014 accusations which were made in a private Facebook post that had leaked and circulated within Hollywood transgender circles.\n\nA copy of that Facebook post was obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. In it, Barnes, without directly naming Tambor, vents about an employer who made comments like \u201cI should be sleeping with him if I want a Hollywood industry appropriate pay grade\u201d and \u201cit wouldn\u2019t take long, he pops quick.\u201d She says the employer subjected her to \u201cbutt pats,\u201d pornography played at loud volumes, and complaints that she \u201cwas useless, could do nothing right.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite having made no public statements to date, the disclosure of Van Barnes\u2019 identity by the press has already led to Ms. Barnes receiving numerous threats and harassment online,\u201d Chazan says. \u201cMs. Barnes is cooperating with the investigation being conducted by Amazon and will not be making a statement while the investigation is pending.\u201d\n\nLysette shared a house with Barnes while Barnes worked as Tambor\u2019s assistant. \u201cShe would pick him up in the morning and bring him home at night and everything in between,\u201d Lysette recalls. \u201cShe would come home wrecked and stressed. I saw him break her down. She for the most part kept it to herself. She was just like, \u2018Girl, he is a piece of work. If you only knew what I\u2019m going through.\u2019 But I knew.\u201d\n\nFor Lysette, an acting neophyte who came to Hollywood directly from New York City, where she worked as a dancer, Tambor\u2019s attentions began early and innocently enough.\n\nShe describes a moment in her first season on the show, a scene set in a yoga studio, when she had trouble finding her mark. \u201cJeffrey stepped in and said, \u2018Come on, that\u2019s hard. I couldn\u2019t even do that.\u2019 And then he and the [director of photography] had a little back and forth. He was sticking up for me.\u201d\n\nWhen the exchange was over, Tambor approached Lysette and \u201ckissed me on the forehead and was like, \u2018Are you good?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m fine.\u2019 It started with things like that. Telling me I looked great, things like that.\u201d\n\nAs Lysette began to step into the spotlight and enjoy her first tastes of fame, she recalls running into Tambor at red carpet events, where she \u201cwould go to hug him and kiss him on the cheek \u2014 and it would land on my lips. And I was like, \u2018OK. What was that about?'\u201d\n\nShe says it wasn\u2019t until the filming of the \u201cyas queen\u201d scene and the alleged physical assault that she was certain she was being targeted and sexually harassed by Tambor. From that moment on, she says life on the set with the actor \u201chas been a roller coaster. One minute Jeffrey is lovely, the next it\u2019s a temper tantrum or flirtation.\u201d\n\nLysette describes another moment \u201cthat sticks in my brain\u201d from later in production of season two: Tambor had set up a meeting between Lysette and his manager for potential representation.\n\nLysette thanked Tambor for the gesture, she says, \u201cand he said, \u2018Well, yeah Trace. I really believe in you. And you know what? I don\u2019t even want to have sex with you.\u2019 And then he just looked at me as if he very much indeed wanted to have sex with me. It was an up-and-down look. I rolled my eyes and went to my trailer and thought, \u2018This man is something else.'\u201d\n\nBoth Lysette and Barnes say they approached Transparent producers with their complaints about Tambor, but no action was taken.\n\nTambor issued this statement to THR in response to Lysette\u2019s allegations:\n\nFor the past four years, I\u2019ve had the huge privilege \u2014 and huge responsibility \u2014 of playing Maura Pfefferman, a transgender woman, in a show that I know has had an enormous, positive impact on a community that has been too long dismissed and misunderstood. Now I find myself accused of behavior that any civilized person would condemn unreservedly. I know I haven\u2019t always been the easiest person to work with. I can be volatile and ill-tempered, and too often I express my opinions harshly and without tact. But I have never been a predator \u2014 ever. I am deeply sorry if any action of mine was ever misinterpreted by anyone as being sexually aggressive or if I ever offended or hurt anyone. But the fact is, for all my flaws, I am not a predator and the idea that someone might see me in that way is more distressing than I can express.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson says, \u201cThis information will be added to our ongoing conversation.\u201d\n\nLysette issued this statement to THR:\n\nLast week, it was reported in the media that Van Barnes, who previously worked as Jeffrey Tambor\u2019s assistant while shooting Transparent, had privately spoken out on her social media about her experiences of abuse. Sadly, I must add my voice to the chorus. Jeffrey has acted inappropriate to me too.\n\nJeffrey has made many sexual advances and comments at me, but one time it got physical.\n\nOne day on set during Season 2, Jeffrey, Alexandra Billings and I were all outfitted in pajamas. I was in a flimsy top and matching short shorts. Upon seeing my in my costume, Jeffrey sexualized me with an over the top comment. Alexandra and I laughed it off because it was so absurd and we thought surely it had to be a bad joke. I shook it off. Then later, in between takes, I stood in a corner on the set as the crew reset for a wide shot. My back was against the wall in a corner as Jeffrey approached me. He came in close, put his bare feet on top of mine so I could not move, leaned his body against me, and began quick, discreet thrusts back and forth against my body. I felt his penis on my hip through his thin pajamas and I pushed him off of me. Again, I laughed it off and rolled my eyes. I had a job to do and I had to do it with Jeffrey, the lead of our show. When they called action, I put that moment in the corner into its own corner of my mind. Compartmentalizing has always been part of my survival took kit, long before I came to Hollywood. It\u2019s shitty to admit out loud \u2014 and I don\u2019t say it to justify what I went through \u2014 but given the journey and circumstances of my life, I was used to being treated as a sexual object by men \u2014 this one just happened to be famous.\n\nDespite multiple uncomfortable experiences with Jeffrey, it has been an incredible, career-solidifying honor to bring life to my character Shea on Amazon\u2019s Transparent. Working on the award-winning series as a low-income trans woman with active roots in New York\u2019s ball culture is a rare opportunity most of my sisters are not given.\n\nMy hope is that Amazon can find the good in this, and use this as an opportunity, a teachable moment to re-center the other trans characters in this show with the family members instead of just pulling it. Let our brilliant writers continue to craft something that is entertaining and creates a social change the way they know how. Don\u2019t let the trans community suffer for the actions of one cis male actor. Transparent has been a guiding light in the industry, by employing more trans people in Hollywood than any other production in history, which made it even more difficult to speak out. As trans-women and survivors we have often felt we never had the power of the voice to speak out on our personal and collective pain. I am so proud of my work on Transparent and its \u201ctrans-affirmative action\u201d mission, as coined by its creator Jill Soloway. And I call on Amazon to make another bold affirmative move to our communities: Remove the problem and let the show go on. It\u2019s vital that the show\u2019s creator, showrunner and its studio re-center the narrative of Transparent on the experiences of the other trans characters and family members audiences have grown to love on the series.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/trace_lysette_and_jeffrey_tambor__split.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/trace_lysette_and_jeffrey_tambor__split.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Seth Abramovitch", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/transparent-star-alleges-jeffrey-tambor-sexually-harassed-her-got-physical-1059306/", "title": "\u2018Transparent\u2019 Star Alleges Jeffrey Tambor Sexually Harassed Her, \u201cGot Physical\u201d", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Trace Lysette, who plays yoga instructor Shea on the series, is the second accuser to allege misconduct by the show's star; Amazon says the new information &quot;will be added to our ongoing investigation.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Seth Abramovitch", "tags": "Amazon Studios, autoplay, Harassment in Hollywood, Jeffrey Tambor, nsfs, THRX, Transparent", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Transparent\u2019 Star Alleges Jeffrey Tambor Sexually Harassed Her, \u201cGot Physical\u201d", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/transparent-star-alleges-jeffrey-tambor-sexually-harassed-her-got-physical-1059306/", "description": "Trace Lysette, who plays yoga instructor Shea on the series, is the second accuser to allege misconduct by the show's star; Amazon says the new information \"will be added to our ongoing investigation.\"", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/trace_lysette_and_jeffrey_tambor__split.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Jeffrey Tambor Accused by 'Transparent' Star of Sexual Harassment"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-16T18:28:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-17T21:00:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Trace Lysette, who plays yoga instructor Shea on the series, is the second accuser to allege misconduct by the show's star; Amazon says the new information \"will be added to our ongoing investigation.\"", "site": "@thr", "creator": "@SethAbramovitch", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Transparent\u2019 Star Alleges Jeffrey Tambor Sexually Harassed Her, \u201cGot Physical\u201d", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/trace_lysette_and_jeffrey_tambor__split.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510856939.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
