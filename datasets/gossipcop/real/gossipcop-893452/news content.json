After beating Giants Janoris Jenkins and securing the catch, Goodwin blew a kiss to the sky before stepping into the end zone. He then fell to his knees, where his teammates surrounded him.\n\nYou can watch the emotional play below.\n\nAfter the game, Goodwin shared a photo to his Instagram account, including a message that explained what had happened. He thanked all of those who sent their support to him and his wife, and asked that more prayers be sent their way.\n\nThe caption read:\n\n\"I just wanna thank those who\u2019ve genuinely prayed for @morganakamomo & myself through out this pregnancy. Unfortunately we lost our baby boy due to some complications, and had to prematurely deliver him early this morning around 4am. Although we are hurt, I am grateful for the experience and grateful that God blessed me with a wife as courageous and resilient as Morgan. The pain (physically, mentally, & emotionally) that she has endured is unbelievable. Please Pray for the Goodwin family.\"", "images": ["https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a09f64f35876e1d008b5acb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a09f64235876e1d008b5aca?width=700", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5a09f64f35876e1d008b5acb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/marquise-goodwin-touchdown-death-newborn-son-2017-11", "title": "49ers wide receiver Marquise Goodwin scores emotional touchdown hours after death of newborn son", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "49ers wide receiver Marquise Goodwin scores emotional touchdown hours after death of newborn son", "datePublished": "2017-11-13T20:36:24.000Z", "dateModified": "2017-11-13T20:36:29.000Z", "news_keywords": "Sports, NFL", "description": "Marquise Goodwin blew a kiss to the sky as he raced to the end zone, just hours after he and his wife lost their infant son", "author": "Tyler Lauletta", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "tbi-vertical": "Sports", "og": {"title": "49ers wide receiver Marquise Goodwin scores emotional touchdown hours after death of newborn son", "description": "Marquise Goodwin blew a kiss to the sky as he raced to the end zone, just hours after he and his wife lost their infant son", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/marquise-goodwin-touchdown-death-newborn-son-2017-11", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/5a09f64f35876e1d008b5acb?width=1200&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"psvp": "c"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "5a09e4a235876eaa008b5a41", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"sections": "Sports", "tags": "Page Type:story"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2025-05", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
