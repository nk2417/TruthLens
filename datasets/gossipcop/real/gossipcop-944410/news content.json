Engaging. Just plain fun and lots of it! Amazing graphics and sound! Rated 5/5 Stars \u2022 Rated 5 out of 5 stars 01/06/25 Full Review Tyler Overall was a fine movie. Had some good moments, some bad moments, and interestingly enough some horror moments. Rated 3.5/5 Stars \u2022 Rated 3.5 out of 5 stars 07/11/23 Full Review Tyler G This is the movie for you if you are into convoys of trucks rolling over various types of terrain and constant little girl shriek-yelling. The opening sequence is the best part of the movie, with a close second the volano scene, and I was so ready to like this movie, but then it goes off the rails. The premise is silly. Who on Earth would think moving these animals off the island is a good idea? And the DNA sequences and process to produce them is now known- there will be more created other than these specific groups of animals. The prices of the dinosaurs at the action are laughably low. At least it leans into being Fast and the Furious-style silly at times. It is watchable and fun at times, but this isn't a good movie. Rated 2.5/5 Stars \u2022 Rated 2.5 out of 5 stars 11/14/25 Full Review Zachary A Listen, I know it\u2019s fiction and the animals aren\u2019t real and that dinosaurs all died once upon a time. However, still don\u2019t love seeing/hearing their cries of fear and agony. I hate it. Showing all of them scared to jump from the cliff into the water and then watching them drown and then watching the brachiosaurus cry for help, legitimately ruined the movie for me. Too depressing. With my personal complaints out of the way, the movie is decently exciting. The second half of the movie is very lame, but the concept of the movie is pretty good. Not a bad movie by any means, but it might be the worst in the franchise. If not this then dominion. Still worth watching. Rated 3/5 Stars \u2022 Rated 3 out of 5 stars 11/09/25 Full Review Thagoon R It's a huge mistake for the filmmakers to have dinosaurs that have grown up in the franchise die in a movie. Most people who saw the movie loved and admired dinosaurs, so look what you gave??
