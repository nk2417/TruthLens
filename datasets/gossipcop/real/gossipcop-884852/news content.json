It was great. I felt really famous that day,\u201d he shared. \u201cIt was a bit awkward because Taylor Swift and I had to present an award.\n\n\"We were walking through the crowd and obviously, there was a little beef between Taylor and Kanye. I didn\u2019t know any of this. But I was there!

I made that b***h famous.\"\n\nThe rapper was criticised for the lyric after he first played the song at his Yeezy Season 3 fashion show but insisted Taylor had given her blessing.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nIdris Elba is the latest heartthrob to read a bedtime story for children READ MORE :\n\nView 7 Images The actor cuts a sharp figure on the red carpet (Image: Getty)\n\nFrom there, things got even more heated when Kim entered the fray in a GQ interview backing up Kanye's claim that Taylor had agreed to him using the lyrics.\n\nShe said: \"She totally approved that. She wanted to all of a sudden act like she didn't. I swear, my husband gets so much s**t for things [when] he really was doing proper protocol and even called to get it approved.\"\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nKim also claimed the phone conversation was recorded, adding: \"And then they sent an attorney's letter like 'Don't you dare do anything with that footage', and asking us to destroy\n\nView 7 Images Kim and Kanye pose for pictures at the Oscars of fashion (Image: Getty)\n\nView 7 Images What feud?

It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone's emotional response to being called 'that b***h' in front of the entire world.\n\n\"Of course I wanted to like the song.

I wanted us to have a friendly relationship.\n\nView 7 Images Months earlier, Kanye had released controversial track Famous (Image: Wireimage)\n\nArticle continues below\n\n\"He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot 'approve' a song you haven't heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination.\n\n\"I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009.\"", "images": ["https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article7884325.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Kim-Kardashian-West-and-Kanye-West-attend-Manus-x-Machina-Fashion-In-An-Age-Of-Technology-Costume-Institute-Gala.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article9316048.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Kim-Kardashian.jpg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/ipso.svg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/footer/trust-project.svg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/nav-web-static/release-v41-14493b7c888038a7d89b99cb3a7937c2b71eaebe/public/logo-reach.png", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article7884605.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Kim-and-Kanye-at-Met-Gala-2016.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article7883879.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Idris-Elba-Met-Gala-2016.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article8950076.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Idris-Elba.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article7883880.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Idris-Elba-Met-Gala-2016.jpg", "https://www.mirror.co.uk/assets/mirror/logos/masthead-mirror-default.svg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article7883940.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/Taylor-Swift-Met-Gala-2016.jpg", "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article8950076.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/Idris-Elba.jpg"], "top_img": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article8950076.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Idris-Elba.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zoe Shenton", "Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/idris-elba-talks-awkward-met-11289659", "title": "Idris Elba talks about 'awkward' Met Gala 2016 with Taylor Swift and Kanye West", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"page_id": 6149699161, "app_id": 123792601022133, "pages": 1814357575554395}, "description": "The pair were deep into their feud following the release of the rapper's controversial track Famous", "author": "Zoe Shenton", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "Googlebot-News": "noarchive", "referrer": "unsafe-URL", "keywords": "Idris Elba, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian", "news_keywords": "Idris Elba, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian", "allowTaboolaDeepDive": "true", "vf": {"00000000-0000-4000-8000-67e599051dc3": "mirror-prod-11289659"}, "og": {"title": "Idris Elba talks about 'awkward' Met Gala 2016 with Taylor Swift and Kanye West", "description": "The pair were deep into their feud following the release of the rapper's controversial track Famous", "url": "http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/idris-elba-talks-awkward-met-11289659", "site_name": "Daily Mirror", "locale": "en_GB", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article8950076.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Idris-Elba.jpg", "type": "article"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-05T03:20:14Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-05T03:21:34Z", "author": "Zoe Shenton", "section": "Celebrity News", "tag": "Kim Kardashian"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@DailyMirror", "creator": "@DailyMirror", "title": "Idris Elba talks about 'awkward' Met Gala 2016 with Taylor Swift and Kanye West - The Mirror", "description": "The pair were deep into their feud following the release of the rapper's controversial track Famous", "image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article8950076.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Idris-Elba.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507173614.0, "source": "https://www.mirror.co.uk", "summary": ""}
