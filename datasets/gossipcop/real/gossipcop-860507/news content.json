It drops on June 23, just two days before Michael\u2019s 54th birthday.\n\nThe heartfelt ballad references several of Michael\u2019s songs (and his fans won\u2019t miss these references). Although it was written with the music legend in mind, it will heal the heart of anyone grieving a significant loss.\n\n\u201cWhen I first heard the sad news of his passing, I was nine months pregnant with my son Monty and I was full of emotions,\u201d Horner explains. \u201cI didn\u2019t know quite what to do with my feelings so I put it in a song, which became \u2018Angels in Chains.'\u201d\n\nIt was produced by Chris Porter, who worked with Michael for more than 30 years. Michael\u2019s \u201cmusic family\u201d also got involved in the track. That family includes Chris Cameron, Phil Palmer, Shirley Lewis, Lucy Jules and Jay Henry who all worked with him for years.\n\n\u201cI feel very blessed to have the opportunity to work on this record with Chris Porter and the same team George had hand picked for his own projects. I am first and foremost a George Michael fan, so to be in the same studio with these amazingly gifted artists who have put their stamp of so many of my favorite records was a real privilege for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the process I found how healing making this record had been not only for me but also for everyone involved. This is our way of saying goodbye to our friend and music idol, and I hope George\u2019s fans enjoy this as much as we have making it,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cAngels in Chains\u201d drops worldwide on June 23.", "images": ["https://www.nashvillenoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Wild-Rivers-Press-credit-Justin-Broadbent-scaled-e1750447053522-768x426.jpg", "https://www.nashvillenoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/zander-hawley.jpg", "https://www.nashvillenoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Looking-to-make-a-lasting-impression-Place-your-ad-here-and-reach-an-engaged-audience-ready-to-discover-what-you-have-to-offer.-Whether-youre-promoting-a-new-product-announcing-an-event-or-buil.png", "https://www.nashvillenoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cropped-cropped-logo-wordpress.jpg", "https://www.nashvillenoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unnamed-4-300x300.jpg", "https://www.nashvillenoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/maxresdefault-8-768x432.jpg", "https://www.nashvillenoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/unnamed-1-768x512.jpg", "https://www.nashvillenoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/unnamed-1-8-600x600.jpg", "https://www.nashvillenoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Geri-Halliwell.jpg", "https://www.nashvillenoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2-600x600.jpg", "https://www.nashvillenoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/wild-cub-i-fall-over-768x518.jpg", "https://www.nashvillenoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/maxresdefault-1-768x432.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nashvillenoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cropped-cropped-logo-wordpress.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Coti Howell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nashvillenoise.com/geri-horner-single/", "title": "Geri Horner Releases \u2018Angels in Chains\u2019 in Memory of George Michael", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "description": "Geri Horner (n\u00e9e Geri Halliwell) is back with her first global release in 12 years! \"Angels in Chains\" is her new single and it's a loving tribute to George Michael.
