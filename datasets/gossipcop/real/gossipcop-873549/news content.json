The pair might not have gotten along like a sept on fire when they finally met in Episode 3, but still, there was chemistry in the Dragonstone throne room. But an incestuous love match between aunt Daenerys and her nephew, Jon, would hardly rate as \u201csurprising\u201d\u2014so what, exactly, do Game of Thrones book readers think they know?\n\nAs with most of the best Thrones theories, this one comes to us via the dreams and prophecies that take up large sections of the books, but which the HBO series has largely had to cut. One of the most intriguing recurring symbols that crops up again and again is the blue winter rose. In the books, Ned remembers \u201cthe moment when all the smiles died, when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen urged his horse past his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell, to lay the queen of beauty\u2019s laurel in Lyanna\u2019s lap. He could see it still: a crown of winter roses, blue as frost.\u201d Lyanna is, as was revealed last season, Jon\u2019s mother and Ned\u2019s sister. In the show, it\u2019s Littlefinger who tells this story to Sansa in Season 5. Yes, he includes the roses.\n\nThis bit about blue roses is taken by readers as both literal and figurative language from Martin, foreshadowing that Rhaegar would soon impregnate Lyanna with baby Jon Snow. Lyanna crops up in dreams and visions (even Theon\u2019s) as a figure crowned in blue winter roses. Ned dreams of her death bed and Jon\u2019s birth:", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/595d5b9d96475a07efe9926f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/got-spoiler-dragon.gif",
