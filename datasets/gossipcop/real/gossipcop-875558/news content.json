Calm your honey what\u2019s this, what\u2019s happening, what\u2019s going on here fretting. The show isn\u2019t ruined! In fact, it\u2019s good. It\u2019s really funny. It\u2019s, well, it\u2019s Will & Grace.\n\nAfter a dizzying number of TV revivals that fans clamored for only to reject upon finding that the fabric of what made the show so beloved was no longer there\u2014or, worse, there but dated\u2014nerves are high surrounding the return of any series.\n\nThat hand-wringing was fervent enough for the friction to start a fire when the Will & Grace revival was announced. Not only have multi-cam sitcoms generally gone out of favor, but the gay humor, certainly revolutionary at the time, isn\u2019t exactly what the kids would call \u201cwoke\u201d today. In fact, they would call it \u201cproblematic.\u201d\n\nRelax. The new episodes are certainly more political and even a little gayer than we expected, but just as funny and nostalgic as we hoped they would be.\n\nThose worried about how the show plays in modern times will go through a real roller coaster of emotions in the first scene of next Thursday\u2019s premiere.\n\nThe first three celebrities name-checked on the new Will & Grace\u2014and everyone knows celebrity name-checking is 40 percent of the fun of Will & Grace\u2014are Steven Tyler, Jon Voight, and Newt Gingrich. Two celebrities young gays probably have never heard of and a Speaker of the House who left office during the sitcom\u2019s first season. Topical.\n\nIt happens during a game of Heads Up. That clue: \u201cHe\u2019s a man but he ages like a lesbian.\u201d\n\nThe next clue, however, is right on the money. Will: \u201cShe\u2019s, ugh, don\u2019t get me started.\u201d Grace: \u201cJada Pinkett-Smith!\u201d Bingo. Then, the first taste of how the show will handle the politics of 2017 gay and political humor. \u201cYou want to love her but she makes it impossible.\u201d Caitlyn Jenner! \u201cRich hostage.\u201d Melania?\n\nNow that we\u2019ve been reintroduced to Will and Grace and reassured that the celebrity jabs will be as biting and as utterly random as ever, we pan to Jack (Sean Hayes), who\u2019s swiping through Grindr, and Karen (Megan Mullally), who is in a medicated stupor that she comes out of to address the two big elephants in the room: Just how directly with the show go after Trump, and how in the hell are they going to explain away the events of the series finale, which saw Will and Grace respectively married, with grown children, and estranged?\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, what\u2019s happening, who won the election?\u201d Karen chirps, her voice as gratingly high as ever, like music to our ears. \u201cYour guy,\u201d Grace harrumphs, settling point one.\n\nKaren mentions a dream she had that Will and Grace were married. \u201cWe were, but we\u2019re single now.\u201d What about the children they had that grew up and married each other? \u201cNever happened.\u201d And just like that, the finale is erased.\n\n\u201cWhat a relief. No one wants to see you raise kids,\u201d Karen says. \u201cWhat would be funny about that?\u201d Jack adds, a meta reference to creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan\u2019s insistence that no fan of Will & Grace wants to see a revival that betrays the fiber of the original run\u2019s magic: the four lead characters hanging out and being hilarious with each other.\n\nOf course, the finale weirdness is but one concern fans had about the revival. Since the return of the series was announced, and likely owed to the fact that it followed last fall\u2019s election-themed reunion short, the press has demanded to know how preachy the new episodes will be when it comes to politics.\n\nAt a time when all shows must \u201csay something,\u201d what will Will & Grace\u2019s agenda be? This is, after all, a show that Joe Biden once credited with moving Americans toward accepting same-sex marriage.\n\nSo how political is it? Well, let\u2019s just say that halfway into the premiere, Grace and Karen are in Trump\u2019s Oval Office while Jack and Will are being hit on by a gay secret serviceman on the White House lawn.\n\nAdmittedly more than the other two episodes we watched, and maybe because it was the \u201cfirst\u201d and the writers felt compelled to, next week\u2019s premiere leans heavy on not just Trump jokes, but also the urgency for people to be social activists. (Of course, that cleverly includes Grace being too lazy and selfish to actually be active.)\n\nWill is writing letters to his congressman. Karen is rubbing Trump\u2019s win in Grace\u2019s face, screaming, \u201cLock her up!\u201d anytime Grace wears something ugly. This is still Will & Grace, though. Fart jokes and \u201cfake news\u201d exist in the same sentence.\n\nWe grilled Mutchnick and Kohan about whether the show will be \u201cwoke\u201d when we talked to them over the summer, and they acknowledged that they \u201cknow that word\u201d and \u201cjust put it in the script.\u201d Now we know what that joke was. Honestly? It\u2019s pretty good.\n\n\u201cI am so impressed. You are so woke,\u201d Grace tells Will. \u201cI used to be woke. Now I use my pussy hat to sneak candy into the movies.\u201d Cue laugh track.\n\nYes, that laugh track is there\u2014well, it's a studio audience, laughing dutifully\u2014and it\u2019s loud. That might be the most jarring part of the revival.\n\nLaugh breaks are so rare these days (though, interestingly, still used on TV's most watched comedy, The Big Bang Theory) that they are considered the first clue that you\u2019re watching something that might be anachronistic, with the canned guffaws thought to telegraph a kind of humor that\u2019s cheaper or not as intelligent as what\u2019s on single-cam comedies. We refute that, but it\u2019s still the generalization.\n\nThat\u2019s kind of the best part of this revival, though. The comedy\u2019s still broad, and sometimes extremely corny. (Sean Hayes is acting in this, folks. It\u2019s not subtle, bless him.) There are spit takes and goofy, occasionally groan-worthy physical comedy bits. In other words, it feels like the same show, which is comforting, if stylistically initially upsetting.\n\nThe pop culture references still fly by at whiplash pace\u2014Ryans both Reyonlds and Gosling, Anderson Cooper, Shonda Rhimes and Scandal, the history of \u201cpower gays\u201d\u2014though often carrying expiration dates with them. Who knows how a Kellyanne Conway reference will play in a few years? Then again, this is also the show that fired off an artillery of Sunny von Bulow jokes a decade ago, so suffice it to say timelessness isn\u2019t of the essence.\n\nIt\u2019s all very nostalgic. But, just like it was then, it\u2019s still very progressive.\n\nWe shudder at the flood of thinkpieces to come debating the show\u2019s politics and especially its gayness. But we think the show actually might have a life raft when it comes to that latter point. Especially once the revival gets the politics-heavy first episode out of the way, it actually seems even \u201cgayer\u201d than before, to speak in unquantifiable terms.\n\nMost pointedly, there\u2019s an exchange between Will and a twentysomething he begins dating played by Dear Evan Hansen\u2019s Ben Platt in the second episode that sort of underlines the generational divide in the gay community, and also the major difference in society between when the show first aired and now.\n\nWill is shocked to learn that his younger beau had no real struggle coming out of the closet. \u201cIt\u2019s so nice, it\u2019s practically abuse\u2026How is it supposed to get better if it\u2019s always fine?\u201d he asks. It\u2019s sitcom simplification of a complicated conversation surrounding progress, but also bitterness in changing times and changing modes of acceptance. Nonetheless, it\u2019s remarkable that the conversation is happening on one of the most anticipated television events of the season.\n\nBut before things get preachy, there\u2019s an ace reference to a Dixie Carter speech from Designing Women that will light Gay Twitter on fire, as well as familiar debate over which Madonna era is the best.\n\nAnd, though we\u2019re not going to spoil when or how, at one point \u201cMake America Gay Again\u201d appears as a slogan in the new episodes.\n\nSo, OK, maybe there is an agenda within the revival. That\u2019s probably inescapable. It\u2019d be impossible not to compare the climate surrounding the series\u2019 return against when it premiered two decades ago.", "images": ["https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/fb.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/email-icon.svg?d=342", "https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/1741381130319.png", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/images/obsessed-header-logo-h-2.png?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/EWN2HO23WFHEPEOB535VFSJESE.jpg?smart=true&auth=5473a7540fbf3f803d5a3b62c7ad7c92b410d0960478a72bc6a3cafa11790f0a&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/7L6PYMCE7RHEBIJZKR23DVTIJI.jpg?smart=true&auth=2558e4fc878237f3ad5bb1aa41ed598bebc770410fe3c21b06f961d190dd7689&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/app_store.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/DDRBYWVYVJJGTIJ3OKEX7ANJQM.jpg?smart=true&auth=edac65e1c4d91a96da685e3b3522476386ef211ba8d6ced92daf5d7f139131b1&width=1200&height=630", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/google_play.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/DDRBYWVYVJJGTIJ3OKEX7ANJQM.jpg?smart=true&auth=edac65e1c4d91a96da685e3b3522476386ef211ba8d6ced92daf5d7f139131b1&width=1600&height=900", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/twitter-icon.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/reddit.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/CA3SBAC7NJGJJI5ZH4T2BOXSSY.jpg?smart=true&auth=febb80c37d6c8f85521f97ca93fe56543f7fa790476febc828f4e461ce8e5882&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/S6IOCL6AWNEALMWV7LXOFK554I.jpg?smart=true&auth=2ec85d2ed830addf129e6a5e35ab932bce77193647a165fff651d99bea87784b&width=1440&height=1080", "https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/thedailybeast/L45553KGABJADHYVQGS7EKWSEI.jpg", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/SDEZH4IJYVANHG7SB7OHOLN25Y.png?smart=true&auth=f6c5d3a487876ce737293fc82e0d933b093632d4a0460243076f5ddaaedf4e9a&width=1440&height=1080"], "top_img": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/DDRBYWVYVJJGTIJ3OKEX7ANJQM.jpg?smart=true&auth=edac65e1c4d91a96da685e3b3522476386ef211ba8d6ced92daf5d7f139131b1&width=1200&height=630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Editor", "Kevin.Fallon Thedailybeast.Com", "Got A Tip", "Send It To The Daily Beast", "Catherine Bouris", "Cameron Adams", "Leigh Kimmins", "Farrah Tomazin", "Julia Ornedo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/relax-the-new-will-and-grace-is-woke-anti-trump-and-still-funny/", "title": "Relax!
