Midway through season five, the character died after being involved in a grisly car accident, leaving her grieving husband, Deacon (Charles Esten), and their two children behind.\n\nBut in the final minutes of Thursday night's series finale, Rayna returned. As Deacon prepares to go on stage at the Ryman Auditorium, he suddenly flashes back to a conversation he had with Rayna on their wedding night.\n\n\"Sometimes, once in your life, somebody gets in your bloodstream,\" she tells him. \"It doesn't matter how much you've failed each other. You must choose each other. And I choose you, exactly the way you are. And I'm gonna love you forever.\"\n\nNeed a news break?

I think everybody had a wonderful time those two days, and just having her back brought some closure to the whole experience for everyone who'd been involved. It was very emotional.\"\n\n\u201cRayna got to do the impossible,\" Britton said in a statement shared with The Tennessean. \"She got to come back from the dead ... to go back to my Nashville family and celebrate all the hard work and love and care that went into that show.\"\n\n'NASHVILLE' FINALE: The most surprising cameos over the years", "images": ["https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/9493b6df966eb1abdd3c3d4465e28be6a46e6e1f/c=231-217-1992-1212/local/-/media/2018/07/26/TennGroup/Nashville/636682149062776151-Deacon-Rayna.jpg?width=1761&height=995&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.tennessean.com/gciaf/prod/p?a=pageview&p=PNAS-TEALIUM-TANGENT&m=web&k=f14ebdd6-0569-4c64-af73-99937bc06379&s=noscript", "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/488a276eb5d4469edaab12d8500946981d9af899/c=0-341-2832-3173/local/-/media/Nashville/USATODAY/2014/03/31//1396297996000-nasdc5-6do0qzjc1k61agym81e7-original.jpg?width=48&height=48&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/42ac9f22ba655241d913e68c5dab893e2f671e12/c=0-209-2783-1781/local/-/media/2018/07/25/TennGroup/Nashville/636681248981592782-120806-a.jpg?width=660&height=372&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/18782d03d273653d883b951e9b1583aa2db3b53a/c=0-225-2998-1919/local/-/media/2016/11/18/TennGroup/Nashville/636150646904999488-NASBrd-06-26-2016-Tennessean-1-E005--2016-06-23-IMG-nashville2-1-1-I3EPKK3F-L833881179-IMG-nashville2-1-1-I3EPKK3F.jpg?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/9493b6df966eb1abdd3c3d4465e28be6a46e6e1f/c=231-217-1992-1212/local/-/media/2018/07/26/TennGroup/Nashville/636682149062776151-Deacon-Rayna.jpg?width=1761&height=995&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/07/26/nashville-finale-connie-britton-returns-rayna-jaymes/843694002/", "title": "'Nashville' finale: Connie Britton returns as Rayna Jaymes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "'Nashville' finale: Connie Britton returns as Rayna Jaymes", "description": "\"Is this real?\" On its final episode, the show brought its lead character back from the dead.", "url": "https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/07/26/nashville-finale-connie-britton-returns-rayna-jaymes/843694002/", "site_name": "The Tennessean", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/9493b6df966eb1abdd3c3d4465e28be6a46e6e1f/c=231-217-1992-1212/local/-/media/2018/07/26/TennGroup/Nashville/636682149062776151-Deacon-Rayna.jpg?width=1761&height=995&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1761, "height": 995}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Dave Paulson", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "\"Is this real?\" On its final episode, the show brought its lead character back from the dead.", "fb": {"pages": 42128399297, "app_id": 121487414583460}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/9493b6df966eb1abdd3c3d4465e28be6a46e6e1f/c=231-217-1992-1212/local/-/media/2018/07/26/TennGroup/Nashville/636682149062776151-Deacon-Rayna.jpg?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@tennessean", "creator": "@tennessean", "title": "'Nashville' finale: Connie Britton returns as Rayna Jaymes", "description": "\"Is this real?\" On its final episode, the show brought its lead character back from the dead."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532577600.0, "source": "https://www.tennessean.com", "summary": ""}
