I told you 20 years ago if I heard of you doing this to another girl or woman we would come for you \u2014 I would come for you. Happy fucking birthday. We win.\u201d\n\nA message to Harvey Weinstein on his birthday #RoseArmy pic.twitter.com/YP61rONbjg \u2014 rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) March 20, 2018\n\nAccording to McGowan\u2019s book, the sexual abuse occurred at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. McGowan went to Weinstein\u2019s hotel suite thinking the two would talk about her career, but he pulled her into a room with a jacuzzi and took off her clothes as soon as she arrived. Weinstein allegedly proceeded to sit her on the side of the jacuzzi, where he forcibly performed oral sex on her while masturbating.\n\nMcGowan has been one of the most outspoken voices against Weinstein throughout the #MeToo movement. His former studio The Weinstein Company officially filed for bankruptcy on March 20, releasing all employees from the Non-Disclosure Agreements they signed while working under Weinstein.", "images": ["https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-20-at-10-51-53-am.png?w=1439&h=887&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2246465707.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7155.jpg?w=3000&h=2656&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TNB_05859_R-H-2024-1.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RMapproved1_michaelweintrob.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7417.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1812551080.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-20-at-10-51-53-am.png?w=650", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2228618796-e1763657792768.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/anaconda.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thoughts-and-prayers-hbo.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Zack-Sharf.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple_TV_Your_Friends_and_Neighbors_key_art_graphic_header_16_9_show_home.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-01-at-8.32.46\u202fPM.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7173.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-Lowdown-Ethan-Hawke-interview.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/VARIETY-SIZING-39.png?resize=232,175", "https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/dish-vs-espn-sling-passes.png?resize=232,175", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-20-at-10-51-53-am.png?w=650", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zack Sharf"], "canonical_link": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/rose-mcgowan-harvey-weinstein-happy-birthday-video-1201941558/", "title": "Rose McGowan Wishes Harvey Weinstein \u2018Happy F*cking Birthday\u2019 in Video Message: \u2018I Told You We\u2019d Be Coming\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "\"I told you we'd be coming,\" McGowan says in her video message to Weinstein.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400654071", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Zack Sharf", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Rose McGowan Wishes Harvey Weinstein \u2018Happy F*cking Birthday\u2019 in Video Message: \u2018I Told You We\u2019d Be Coming\u2019", "url": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/rose-mcgowan-harvey-weinstein-happy-birthday-video-1201941558/", "description": "\"I told you we'd be coming,\" McGowan says in her video message to Weinstein.", "site_name": "IndieWire", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-20-at-10-51-53-am.png?w=650", "width": 650, "height": 401, "alt": "Rose McGowan Wishes Harvey Weinstein 'Happy F*cking Birthday'"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-20T14:55:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-01-15T20:19:40+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\"I told you we'd be coming,\" McGowan says in her video message to Weinstein.", "site": "@IndieWire", "creator": "@zsharf", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Rose McGowan Wishes Harvey Weinstein \u2018Happy F*cking Birthday\u2019 in Video Message: \u2018I Told You We\u2019d Be Coming\u2019", "image": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/screen-shot-2018-03-20-at-10-51-53-am.png?w=650"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-iw_favicon.png?w=270", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521557706.0, "source": "https://www.indiewire.com", "summary": ""}
