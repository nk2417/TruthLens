I experienced joy for the first time in days. And I remembered... we are free. We are all different but we are free to enjoy each other's company.\n\n\"I will honour those that are lost by living each day full. Full of fun, full of laughter, full of joy. I welcome the differences of my neighbour.\n\n\"The wish of terrorism is to take away that feeling of freedom and joy. No. That is my answer. No. We cant allow it. Fear cannot rule the day.\n\n\"More people die each year from car crashes then terrorism. Yet I will get in my car. I will choose to live than to be afraid.\n\n\"So... Manchester I stand with you. Jakarta I stand with you. Children of Syria I stand with you. We will honour you by not giving in to the darkness.\n\n\"And I will honour all of you by laughing loving and living. Living full for every wonderful innocent child whose life was taken to soon.\n\n\"So if you think you scared us, if you think your coward[ly] act made us change how we live... sorry. All you did was make us appreciate every day.\n\n\"With extraordinary evil we must fight with extraordinary greatness. Fight on. Goodnight world. Tomorrow I live full.\n\n\"I will honour all of u by laughing loving and living. Living full for every wonderful innocent child whose life was taken too soon.\n\n\"Am I angry? Hell yes. But how will we respond? With everything you think you took from us... love and joy and life.\"", "images": ["https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/7094/production/_96202882_pa_styles.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/2BE5/production/_96173211_gettyimages-687069882.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/385/cpsprodpb/5105/live/5217d720-c5d7-11f0-82c9-1574c476e20e.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/e070/live/0f8ea1f0-c540-11f0-b288-51552c83ad58.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/385/cpsprodpb/28af/live/8eb42120-c55f-11f0-a954-fb8c05ee113c.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/385/cpsprodpb/56e3/live/1da5b0c0-c532-11f0-9839-6584ec7afe70.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/2050/live/cba5e0e0-c565-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/385/cpsprodpb/424a/live/63c58a80-c627-11f0-a892-01d657345866.png", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/464/mcs/media/images/76020000/jpg/_76020974_line976.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/2048/cpsprodpb/9D5F/production/_96178204_victims-manchester.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/385/cpsprodpb/66c3/live/d26f1c70-c52e-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/142BC/production/_96202628_gettyimages-154762625.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/385/cpsprodpb/5403/live/73cea3e0-58c1-11f0-9074-8989d8c97d87.png", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/385/cpsprodpb/4ed5/live/4f155cd0-c5e8-11f0-9fb5-5f3a3703a365.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/F49C/production/_96202626_scooter-ariana-getty.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/385/cpsprodpb/d83e/live/3939e240-c56c-11f0-8c06-f5d460985095.png", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_news/1200/cpsprodpb/F49C/production/_96202626_scooter-ariana-getty.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/176E8/production/_96167959_arianapa.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/0c5a/live/4ac94960-b680-11f0-b2a1-6f537f66f9aa.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/976/cpsprodpb/10001/production/_96173556_grandepa.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/480/cpsprodpb/7a45/live/c54feaf0-6ef4-11f0-af20-030418be2ca5.jpg", "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/standard/385/cpsprodpb/825c/live/bbaa0e60-c474-11f0-9b68-57906bffd3ed.png"], "top_img": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_news/1200/cpsprodpb/F49C/production/_96202626_scooter-ariana-getty.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-40011948", "title": "Ariana Grande's manager Scooter Braun pays tribute to Manchester victims", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "It is the first time he has spoken publicly since the attack which killed 22 people at the star's Manchester concert.", "theme-color": "#FFFFFF", "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/bbcnews", "section": "Entertainment & Arts"}, "fb": {"admins": 100004154058350, "app_id": 3662195467332439}, "og": {"description": "It is the first time he has spoken publicly since the attack which killed 22 people at the star's Manchester concert.", "image": {"identifier": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_news/1200/cpsprodpb/F49C/production/_96202626_scooter-ariana-getty.jpg", "alt": "Scooter Braun and Ariana Grande"}, "locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "BBC News", "title": "Ariana Grande's manager Scooter Braun pays tribute to Manchester victims", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-40011948"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@BBCWorld", "description": "It is the first time he has spoken publicly since the attack which killed 22 people at the star's Manchester concert.", "image": {"src": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/ace/branded_news/1200/cpsprodpb/F49C/production/_96202626_scooter-ariana-getty.jpg", "alt": "Scooter Braun and Ariana Grande"}, "site": "@BBCWorld", "title": "Ariana Grande's manager Scooter Braun pays tribute to Manchester victims"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#bb1919", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/core/website/assets/static/icons/windows-phone/news/windows-phone-icon-270x270.23502b4459.png", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.bbc.com", "summary": ""}
