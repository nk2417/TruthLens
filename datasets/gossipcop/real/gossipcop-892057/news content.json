Tonight, JAY-Z shared a note on Facebook decrying the sentence. \u201cThe sentence handed down by the Judge\u2014against the recommendation of the Assistant District Attorney and Probation Officer\u2014is unjust and heavy handed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe will always stand by and support Meek Mill, both as he attempts to right this wrongful sentence and then in returning to his musical career.\u201d\n\nMeek Mill was arrested in March for misdemeanor assault charges, and again in August for reckless driving and reckless endangerment. Charges from both of those incidents have been dropped, but the incidents led to today\u2019s court date to review whether or not he had violated his probation.", "images": ["https://pitchfork.com/verso/static/pitchfork-us/assets/logo-inverted.svg", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a0139d07d91c73e0284a592/2:1/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-842365292.jpg", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a0139d07d91c73e0284a592/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-842365292.jpg", "https://pitchfork.com/verso/static/pitchfork-us/assets/logo-reverse.svg", "https://pitchfork.com/verso/static/pitchfork-us/assets/logo-header.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a0139d07d91c73e0284a592/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-842365292.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evan Minsker"], "canonical_link": "https://pitchfork.com/news/jay-z-calls-meek-mills-prison-sentence-unjust-and-heavy-handed/", "title": "JAY-Z Calls Meek Mill\u2019s Prison Sentence \u201cUnjust and Heavy Handed\u201d", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Evan Minsker", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "\u201cWe will always stand by and support Meek Mill\u201d", "id": "5a01385c0e15342eab4c1e16", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a01385c0e15342eab4c1e16", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"\u201cWe will always stand by and support Meek Mill\u201d\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a0139d07d91c73e0284a592/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-842365292.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a0139d07d91c73e0284a592/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-842365292.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\u201cWe will always stand by and support Meek Mill\u201d", "image": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a0139d07d91c73e0284a592/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-842365292.jpg", "site_name": "Pitchfork", "title": "JAY-Z Calls Meek Mill\u2019s Prison Sentence \u201cUnjust and Heavy Handed\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://pitchfork.com/news/jay-z-calls-meek-mills-prison-sentence-unjust-and-heavy-handed/"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-11-07T04:44:45.232Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-07T04:44:45.232Z", "author": "Evan Minsker"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@pitchfork", "description": "\u201cWe will always stand by and support Meek Mill\u201d", "domain": "https://pitchfork.com", "image": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a0139d07d91c73e0284a592/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-842365292.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@pitchfork", "title": "JAY-Z Calls Meek Mill\u2019s Prison Sentence \u201cUnjust and Heavy Handed\u201d"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5a0139d07d91c73e0284a592/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/GettyImages-842365292.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 207089362687909, "pages": 28015075999}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510029885.232, "source": "https://pitchfork.com", "summary": ""}
