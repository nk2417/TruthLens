The report stated that Fisher\u2019s family objected to a full autopsy, and coroner\u2019s investigators had access to limited toxicology specimens. The conclusions were based on toxicology results and an external examination of Fisher\u2019s body.\n\nFisher died on Dec. 27, four days after going into cardiac arrest on an airplane arriving at LAX from London. The report states that Fisher\u2019s assistant was on the plane with her. The assistant reported that she was awake and normal at the beginning of the flight, but had \u201cmultiple apneic episodes, which was her baseline\u201d during the flight. At the end of the flight, she could not be awoken.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cBased on the available toxicological information, we cannot establish the significance of the multiple substances that were detected in Ms. Fisher\u2019s blood and tissue, with regard to the cause of death,\u201d the report states.\n\nAccording to the report, Fisher may have ingested the cocaine as early as three days before the flight, adding to the uncertainty about the cause of death. The report also notes a likely exposure to heroin, which could have suppressed her breathing as she went into cardiac arrest.\n\nIn addition to the illegal drugs, Fisher was also taking Prozac, Abilify and Lamictal under prescription. She was also taking oxycodone without a prescription.\n\nThe report also notes that Fisher had a history of bipolar disorder and a long history of drug use.\n\nCarrie Fisher Autopsy Report by gmaddaus on Scribd", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/carrie-fisher-heart-attack.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/carrie-fisher-heart-attack.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gene Maddaus", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/carrie-fisher-autopsy-cocaine-heroin-ecstasy-1202470282/", "title": "Carrie Fisher Had Cocaine, Heroin, Ecstasy in Her System, Autopsy Shows", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Carrie Fisher had cocaine, heroin, and ecstasy in her system when she became ill on a flight in December, according to her autopsy report.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Gene Maddaus", "tags": "Carrie Fisher", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Carrie Fisher Had Cocaine, Heroin, Ecstasy in Her System, Autopsy Shows", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/biz/news/carrie-fisher-autopsy-cocaine-heroin-ecstasy-1202470282/", "description": "Carrie Fisher had cocaine, heroin, and ecstasy in her system when she became ill on a flight in December, according to her autopsy report.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/carrie-fisher-heart-attack.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Carrie Fisher heart attack"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-19T16:15:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-19T20:49:45+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Carrie Fisher had cocaine, heroin, and ecstasy in her system when she became ill on a flight in December, according to her autopsy report.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@GeneMaddaus", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Carrie Fisher Had Cocaine, Heroin, Ecstasy in Her System, Autopsy Shows", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/carrie-fisher-heart-attack.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497888951.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
