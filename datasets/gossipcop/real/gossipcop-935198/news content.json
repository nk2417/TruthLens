It has gained quite a bit of interest from fans, and in the second episode of the series, she talked about some very close and personal things, including pain and loss from her past.\n\nAccording to E! Online , the latest news coming from the series is Pinkett Smith reflecting on the death of her close friend, Tupac Shakur.\n\nShakur was killed back in September 1996 in what many viewed as a major mystery. Others believe that Tupac faked his own death, while still others believe that Shakur was killed as an accident and that the real target that night was Suge Knight.\n\nNo matter what the real story is behind his death, Pinkett Smith still finds herself getting \u201creally mad\u201d about his death.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of loss. So many of my close friends gone. They didn\u2019t make it to 30. They didn\u2019t make it past 25. A lot of people talk about my relationship with Pac and figure that out. That was a huge loss in my life.\u201d\n\nShe went on to talk about why his death has such an impact on her life.\n\n\u201cBecause he was one of those people I expected to be here. My upset is more anger because I feel like he left me. and I know that\u2019s not true and it\u2019s a very selfish way to think about it\u2026 I really did believe he\u2019d be here for the long run. And when I think about it I still get really mad. He played his role\u2026he did what he was meant to do\u2026he\u2019s an icon\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people talk about my relationship with Pac and figure that out. That was a huge loss I my life.\u201d https://t.co/kla4eUz4ZF \u2014 E! News (@enews) May 14, 2018\n\nMany people share the same sentiment as Pinkett Smith. Tupac was one of the best musical artists of all time and was a very loved person. His death rocked the entertainment world.\n\nWillow Smith also shared a story of personal loss. Her biggest loss at one point was her sanity.\n\n\u201cI would have to say, honestly feel like I lost my sanity at one point. It was after that whole \u2018Whip My Hair\u2019 thing\u2019\u2026 I just stopped doing singing lessons and I was kind of like in this gray area of like who am I? Do I have a purpose? Is there anything like that I can do besides this?\u201d\n\nThose that may not have heard about the new series should tune in. Those that did watch the last episode will likely agree with or understand many of the things that Pinkett Smith said about Tupac along with the other topics discussed on the show.", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/2421769f-57a4-4bff-913f-cf316747493e.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20157'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20492%20142'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/transparent-logo-white.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/inquisitr-logo.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4bdc5ecd52ec4ee79f4f4c26c27496ae?s=120&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent-Dark-Mode.png", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/inquisitr-logo-Transparent.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20120%20120'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["News Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/jada-pinkett-smith-is-still-really-mad-about-tupac-shakurs-death", "title": "Jada Pinkett Smith Is Still \u2018Really Mad\u2019 About Tupac Shakur\u2019s Death", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/favicon.png", "description": "Jada Pinkett Smith is part of a new Facebook Watch series titled Red Table Talk .
