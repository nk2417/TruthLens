{"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-jon-snow-and-daenerys-targaryen-related-aunt-nephew-2017-3", "text": "Warning: Spoilers ahead for \"Game of Thrones.\"\n\nFor decades, the \"Game of Thrones\" fandom mused over Jon Snow's potential true parentage. Now we finally know Jon is the son of Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark.\n\nWe've broken down the two family trees of houses Stark and Targaryen, with a clear label for Jon Snow's parents.\n\nRhaegar was the son of the Mad King Aerys, and older brother to Daenerys and Viserys Targaryen. Lyanna was the only daughter of Rickard Stark, and sister to Ned, Benjen, and Brandon.\n\nSince Jon Snow is the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, that means Daenerys is his aunt.\n\nThis graphic (which uses the book series' birth and death dates) should give you a clear sense for how Jon fits into the two greatest families of Westeros:\n\nSkye Gould/Shayanne Gal/INSIDER\n\nSince Ned Stark is Jon's uncle, that makes Sansa, Arya, and Bran his cousins (not half-siblings, as they all believed).\n\nRickon is still alive in the books, and almost all of the characters have been aged up by a few years for the show. The birth and death dates listed are from George R.R. Martin's original book series. Years in Westeros are marked A.C. for \"Aegon's Conquest\" or \"After the Conquest.\"\n\nDaenerys and Jon's blood relationship means some fans think it would be rather awkward for them to head down a romantic path together. However, it's worth noting that incest is relatively commonplace in the Targaryen family tree.\n\nThough both Rhaegar and Lyanna are mysterious figures, there is some historical information we know about them from Martin's book series. To learn more about Prince Rhaegar, read our breakdown of his life growing up and the fateful first time he met Lyanna.", "images": ["https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/597e97c6d7f5a4102f15ff95?width=700", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5cb4b696b1e0a20d414ec3ea?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5cb4b696b1e0a20d414ec3ea?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Skye Gould", "Kim Renfro"], "canonical_link": "http://www.thisisinsider.com/game-of-thrones-jon-snow-and-daenerys-targaryen-related-aunt-nephew-2017-3", "title": "Here's how Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are related in 'Game of Thrones'", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Here's how Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are related in 'Game of Thrones'", "datePublished": "2017-03-30T21:02:00.000Z", "dateModified": "2019-10-24T16:32:31.006Z", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Game of Thrones, HBO", "description": "Based on their revealed parentage, it turns out Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are closely related.", "author": "Skye Gould, Kim Renfro", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "tbi-vertical": "Entertainment", "og": {"title": "Here's how Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are related in 'Game of Thrones'", "description": "Based on their revealed parentage, it turns out Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen are closely related.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/game-of-thrones-jon-snow-and-daenerys-targaryen-related-aunt-nephew-2017-3", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/5cb4b696b1e0a20d414ec3ea?width=1200&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"psvp": "c"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "58dd7160dd08955e5f8b47f5", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"sections": "Entertainment", "tags": "Page Type:story"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2025-05", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
