Even Kit Harington is emotional about the show ending.\n\nDuring an interview with The One Show on Friday, Harington said he teared up while reading the final script.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\n\u201cWe had the read through last week in fact, so I know everything now,\u201d Harington said, referencing the famous \u201cYou know nothing Jon Snow\u201d quote. \u201cBut I cried at the end.\u201d\n\nUp Next: \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Stars Share Details About Season 8\n\nHarington made sure no one took his comment as a spoiler, insisting that he was crying for sentimental reasons. After all, he\u2019s worked on the show for over eight years with many of the same cast members.\n\n\u201cYou have to remember that eight years of it no one really cares about it more than us,\u201d Harington said on The One Show. \u201cI get a bit weepy thinking about it. It\u2019s going to be a strange year saying goodbye to everyone and having last scenes with this person and that person.\u201d\n\nHarington\u2019s comment about reading the script before production appears to contradict co-star Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. Earlier this month, Coster-Waldau said on a Scandinavian talk show that the actors will be fed their lines through earpieces. That way, HBO doesn\u2019t have to distribute scripts that could be leaked by hackers.\n\nCoster-Waldau might have joking though, as other actors have said they were meeting for a table read. Liam Cunningham, who plays Davos, said the actors were meeting for a table read of the entire season before filming began.\n\nUp Next: Kit Harington Engaged to Former \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Co-Star\n\nProducing on GOT\u2018s final season started this month. The season will only run six episodes, which will all be much longer than previous episodes. The episodes aren\u2019t expected to air until 2019.\n\n\u201c[They\u2019re] definitely going to be bigger and what I hear is longer,\u201d Cunningham told TV Guide on Oct. 5. \u201cWe\u2019re filming right up until the summer. When you think about it, up until last season we\u2019d have six months to do ten episodes, so we\u2019re [doing] way more than that for six episodes. So that obviously will translate into longer episodes.\u201d", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/09/509733a3-2776-41c2-ae2f-87bd457740ba.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/03/0bc568f0-8d62-4207-9b26-f4bf04c14200.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/04/45511bc5-8791-4d0b-a2e9-34e9c9011b24.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/70afec6a-3143-4947-b047-428e525611d4.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel S.
