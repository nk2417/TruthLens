It\u2019s teased that Scamander is acting under orders from Dumbledore to head to Paris, but as the future-Hogwarts headmaster notes, Scamander isn\u2019t one for taking orders well.\n\nThe David Yates film follows Dumbledore and Scamander, his former student, as they join forces to recapture an escaped Gellert Grindelwald, played by Johnny Depp, who is on a mission to dominate all non-magical people with the help of his pureblood wizard followers.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t move against Grindelwald,\u201d Dumbledore tells Scamander in the clip. \u201cIt has to be you.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe trailer debuted amid casting controversy surrounding Depp, who was accused of domestic abuse by his ex-wife, Amber Heard, in court filings.
