Does anyone know any BTS info on these relationships? Conspiracy theories? Deleted comments/posts?\n\nFrom my POV I've noticed:\n\nCam, Naomi, Chelsea, Danni all have mutual communication with each other.\n\nKathryn seems to only have mutual communication with Danni (people comment on her posts but she doesn't comment on others). She doesn't seem to hang with the cast outside of Danni either.\n\nThe guys are generally inconsistent but Madison (Austen's new GF) comments on Chelsea's posts.", "images": ["https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2v6dk/styles/bannerBackgroundImage_txoxgh5u539c1.jpg?format=pjpg&s=f78d1ac571b35c1cc464d03367ba034474fa663a", "https://id.rlcdn.com/472486.gif", "https://www.redditstatic.com/shreddit/assets/favicon/64x64.png", "https://styles.redditmedia.com/t5_2v6dk/styles/communityIcon_t5hgvbknv9cd1.png?width=96&height=96&frame=1&auto=webp&crop=96%3A96%2Csmart&s=9eaddbbfdf8d0317a73a2834bd2f3c0336e23cb4"], "top_img": "https://www.redditstatic.com/shreddit/assets/favicon/64x64.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "The heart of the internet", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#000000", "theme-color": "#000000"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.reddit.com", "summary": ""}
