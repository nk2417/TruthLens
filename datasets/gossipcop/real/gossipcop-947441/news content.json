Showing off the beach in her native country of India, Chopra snapped a pic of the 25-year-old \"Find You\" singer and another man standing in front of the ocean in Goa.\n\n\"My favourite men,\" the actress wrote on the snap alongside a smiling emoji with heart eyes. The photo comes after the couple jetted off to India together last week, where a source told ET that Jonas would meet Chopra's mother, Madhu, for the first time.\n\nInstagram Story\n\nOn Friday, the brunette beauty made an appearance on Jonas' Instagram for the first time. In the Instagram Story video, Chopra flashed an adorable smile as she ran towards Jonas on a balcony. \"Her,\" the \"Jealous\" singer wrote alongside the clip, with a heart-eye emoji.\n\nThe twosome was first linked after they walked the red carpet together at the 2017 Met Gala.
