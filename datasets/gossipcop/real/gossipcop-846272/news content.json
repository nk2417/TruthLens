Justin Timberlake took to Instagram on Monday, July 31, to praise his wife, Jessica Biel, for her performance on her new TV series, The Sinner.\n\nRelated: Jessica Biel\u2019s Red Carpet Evolution See how Jessica Biel -- the star named by Us Weekly readers as their Celebrity Style Crush -- has changed her look over the years\n\n\u201cOK, I know I\u2019m not exactly fair and maybe biased here, but my wife\u2019s new show \u2013 @thesinnerusa \u2013 is amazing,\u201d the 10-time Grammy winner, 36, captioned a trailer for the eight-episode USA Network crime drama. \u201cIt\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve seen her in before, and she\u2019s incredible in the role. You should check it out when it premieres Wednesday on USA. \u2013JT.\u201d\n\nThe actress, 35, plays Cora, a young mother living in upstate New York who commits a brutal act of violence against a stranger. The series, which many critics are calling a \u201cwhydunit\u201d rather than a \u201cwhodunit,\u201d follows Cora and her inner struggles as viewers attempt to decipher whether her crime was motivated. \u201cI just did it. And I don\u2019t know why,\u201d a blood-soaked Cora says in one teaser.\n\nRelated: Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel Through the Years Bike rides, courtside PDA, red carpet glam, and more!

But what makes us cross the line?\u201d\n\nRelated: Justin Timberlake\u2019s Most Memorable Film & TV Roles As he turns 31, look back at his best credits\n\nThe 7th Heaven alum also revealed how she\u2019d react if her and Timberlake\u2019s 2-year-old son, Silas, decides to become an actor one day. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say no because I was given so many opportunities and my family was so supportive of everything, even when I was so young. But it\u2019s hard to say yes because it\u2019s such an intense experience,\u201d she said on Today. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough business. It\u2019s a ruthless business. I would be hesitant if he was so young.\u201d\n\nThe Sinner premieres on USA on Wednesday, August 2, at 10 p.m. ET.", "images":
