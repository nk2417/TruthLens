Among the other attendees? None other than the rapper\u2019s wife and Grammy-winner Beyonc\u00e9.\n\nIn the photo, Haddish, 38, wears a wide smile as the singer appears to whisper in her ear while peeking at the camera with one eye.\n\n\u201c@beyonce was telling me that my wig was slipping\u2026. \ud83d\ude02 But for real she told me to have fun and I DID! #SHEREADY #thelastblackunicorn#beyonce,\u201d Haddish wrote in the caption.\n\nIn a second photo, the comedian took a selfie with Black Panther actor Michael B. Jordan, writing, \u201cRan into @michaelbjordan last night that was fun. #sheready #thelastblackunicorn.\u201d\n\nHaddish also shared a selfie with JAY-Z himself, writing, \u201cJay-Z after I told him Jaleel white is the only black man I know of to have his own Breakfast Cereal.\ud83d\ude01\u2026.. But for real I had fun #jayz show last night was everything!\u201d\n\nThis is not the first run in Haddish has had with other celebrities. She had the pleasure of teaching Barbra Streisand the lyrics to Cardi B\u2018s \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d in November while the two were at the same party over Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nThe star smiled as Streisand, who Haddish lovingly referred to as her \u201cbig sister,\u201d leaned in with her hand on her new pal\u2019s shoulder.\n\nBehind them, other partygoers helped themselves to the buffet of food \u2014 including Streisand\u2019s actor husband James Brolin \u2014 but the two stars were busy catching up on the latest musicians moving up the charts.\n\n\u201cJust so y\u2019all know I taught my big sister about @CardiB_ today,\u201d Haddish captioned the pic on Twitter.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171223100414im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/tiffany-haddish1.jpg?crop=0px%2C646px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171223100414im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171223100414im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/prod/assets/themes/magazines/default/template-resources/images/PE/covers/peoplecover_205x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171223100414im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/tiffany-haddish1.jpg?w=2000", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171223100414im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/article-covers/3313_106804645_2016_05_02_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171223100414im_/http://people.com/img/sign-up-bg.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171223100414im_/https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/tiffany-haddish1.jpg?crop=0px%2C646px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexia Fernandez"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171223100414/http://people.com/movies/tiffany-haddish-takes-selfie-beyonce-jay-z-concert/", "title": "Tiffany Haddish Takes Selfie with Beyonce at JAY-Z's Concert", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "tiffany haddish, beyonce, jay-z, music news, news, celebrities, movie celebrities, tiffany haddish takes selfie with beyonce at jay-z's concert", "news_keywords": "tiffany haddish, beyonce, jay-z, music news, news, celebrities, movie celebrities, tiffany haddish takes selfie with beyonce at jay-z's concert", "description": "Tiffany Haddish made some new friends at JAY-Z's concert, namely Beyonce and Michael B.
