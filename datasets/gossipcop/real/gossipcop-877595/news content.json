This morning, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle announced the news that they are expecting their first child together.\n\n\"Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019,\" reads a Tweet from Kensington Palace, released before the Duke and Duchess officially kicked off their royal tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and Tonga.\n\n\"Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.\"\n\nA spokesperson also revealed that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge \"are delighted for the couple and were able to congratulate them on Friday at the wedding in person.\"\n\n\n\nSeveral members of the royal family including the Queen and Prince Charles shared their joy about Meghan's pregnancy this morning, as did Meghan's mom, Doria Ragland, who said she's \"very happy at this lovely news and is looking forward to welcoming her first grandchild.\"\n\nWhile the newest addition to the Sussex family isn't due until Spring 2019 (given that Meghan has reportedly had her 12 week scan, many royal reporters are more specifically predicting April or May), Prince William and Duchess Kate will actually become an aunt and uncle for the first time the fall as Kate's sister Pippa is expecting her first child with her husband James Matthews.\n\nPippa was recently seen at Princess Eugenie's wedding , and is thought to be due in the coming weeks.\n\nADRIAN DENNIS // Getty Images", "images": ["https://www.townandcountrymag.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/images/privacy/opt-out.66f7eeb.svg",
