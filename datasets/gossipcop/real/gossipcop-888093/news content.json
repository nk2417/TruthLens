Check it out below.\n\nThematically, Swift again seems to unintentionally (or... come on, probably intentionally) bring fr enemy Kanye West into the narrative. \"Gorgeous\" is the title of the second track on West's critically acclaimed My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy album, which was widely seen as saving his career after the infamous 2009 VMA mic-grabbing moment. Additionally, the child's voice in the teaser could be heard as referential to the preaching little girl that kicks off West's Life of Pablo album.\n\n... Or maybe we're just too deep in the feud-shade conspiracy for our own good. Honestly, that's just as likely.\n\nEither way, we are clearly in the thick of a long-awaited Swift season and could not be more pumped! The only person who might be more excited is Swift's London superfan, whom the singer surprised at her home.\n\nWatch the video below!", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-10/taylor_swift_518799092.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2019-08/1280taylor.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2024-04/1280_kanye_taylor_kim.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/taylor_swift_518799092.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/taylor_swift_518799092.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/taylor_swift_518799092.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/taylor-swift-teases-new-song-gorgeous-dropping-midnight-listen-89522", "title": "Taylor Swift Teases New Song 'Gorgeous' Dropping at Midnight -- Listen!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/taylor_swift_518799092.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 'Reputation' singer is serving up the third single off her upcoming album", "title": "Taylor Swift Teases New Song 'Gorgeous' Dropping at Midnight -- Listen!", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/taylor-swift-teases-new-song-gorgeous-dropping-midnight-listen-89522", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 'Reputation' singer is serving up the third single off her upcoming album", "twitter": {"description": "The 'Reputation' singer is serving up the third single off her upcoming album", "title": "Taylor Swift Teases New Song 'Gorgeous' Dropping at Midnight -- Listen!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/taylor-swift-teases-new-song-gorgeous-dropping-midnight-listen-89522", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/taylor_swift_518799092.jpg?h=c673cd1c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Taylor Swift Teases New Song 'Gorgeous' Dropping at Midnight -- Listen! | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, Music, News, Taylor Swift", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
