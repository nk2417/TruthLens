So that\u2019s kind of what happened with this,\u201d he tells PEOPLE about making his debut in the competition in the Denver city qualifying round, airing Monday. \u201cIt was coming to Denver and we obviously live nearby there and it just seemed like a worthwhile effort to give it a shot. They let me have a chance, so I was fortunate in that regard. I guess I just figured, \u2018Why not? Let\u2019s see what this is all about.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThough the course includes a variation of challenging obstacles, he was, overall, physically prepared to take on the competition.\n\n\u201cI always try to keep myself in good enough physical condition that when opportunities like this come along, I don\u2019t need a year to prepare,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, the one thing I did sort of lack is that I don\u2019t do a ton of upper body strength stuff. I\u2019m not a climber, so there were concerns there for me. I tried to kind of cram, I guess if you will, some upper body strength stuff.\u201d\n\nDustin Bradford/NBC\n\nTo help prepare him for the competition, he built a grip gym in his garage, as well as visited a ninja gym numerous times with his family.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re Ninja Warrior fans, especially my son, Max. For about a month while I was really focusing on trying to do as best I could on the course, Max and I would drive down \u2014 actually Trista and [Blakesley] came a few times too \u2014 we would drive down to Denver to this little ninja gym that they have down there \u2014 obstacles and balance things,\u201d he shares about traveling with wife, Trista Sutter, whom he met on season 1 of The Bachelorette, and their two children: son Maxwell \u201cMax\u201d Alston, 9, and daughter Blakesley Grace, 8.\n\nTrista Sutter/Instagram\n\n\u201cHe had as much fun, if not more fun, than I did just with the challenges and swinging on ropes and running up walls and all that kind of stuff was what we were practicing. The element of excitement to just have their dad be going on Ninja Warrior, but then also there was this enthusiasm for the fact that they could participate in it to some degree as well, so that was actually fun,\u201d Sutter, a lieutenant firefighter with the Vail Fire Dept., shares.\n\nFROM PEN: Former Bachelorette Ali Fedotowsky Opens Up About Her Biggest Parenting Mishap\n\nSutter adds, \u201cIt kind of brought us together as a family and gave us a really fun thing to do together. It\u2019s actually kind of stuck. We still kind of continue to do a lot of that kind of stuff. \u2026 It just has become something that we do and it\u2019s really fun.\u201d\n\nDustin Bradford/NBC\n\nThough the course \u201cdefinitely wasn\u2019t easier\u201d than he initially thought, he was pleasantly surprised that his fellow competitors were nothing but supportive.\n\n\u201cFrom day one of acceptance onto the program and beginning to train at the gyms, every single person that I came into contact with and was involved with Ninja Warrior, whether it was production side or especially the athlete side, were about as nice as you could possibly be,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like that\u2019s what makes it so cool is that everyone really seems to be pulling for each other and supporting each other. It\u2019s this undeniable community that you feel like you\u2019ve become a part of.\u201d\n\nAmerican Ninja Warrior airs Mondays (8 p.m. ET) on NBC.", "images":
