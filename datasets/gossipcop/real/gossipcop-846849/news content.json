The husband-and-wife team took a different kind of gamble when they agreed to an interrogation about their experience. We grilled them separately to see how their answers stacked up.\n\nHe Said\u2014Bristol Marunde\n\nWhat was the most significant hurdle you faced?\n\nNeighbors! If they\u2019re nice, then they want to see everything. On the flip side, we have some angry ones. It\u2019s a challenge to manage the neighborhood.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest disagreement you\u2019ve ever had over a renovation?\n\nWhen we have a few days to finish, and Aubrey comes up with this fantastic design that she wants in the house.\n\nWhat\u2019s Aubrey\u2019s biggest strength?\n\nShe does not take no for an answer. She knows how to get things done.\n\nIf you could flip a house with another pro, who would you choose?\n\nVanilla Ice [who has a DIY renovation show]! We could collaborate and make some magic.\n\nShe Said\u2014Aubrey Marunde\n\nWhat was the most significant hurdle you faced?\n\nTime. There just never seems to be enough of it. Things move so fast in the Vegas market that you really need to be on top of your A game all the time.\n\nWhat\u2019s the biggest disagreement you\u2019ve ever had over a renovation?\n\nWe hardly ever have disagreements. I guess the only thing that Bristol ever really gives me a funny look about is some of the colors that I come up with.\n\nWhat\u2019s Bristol\u2019s biggest strength?\n\nHe\u2019s a people person and he\u2019s very hands-on with the project. He\u2019s there every day.\n\nIf you could flip a house with another pro, who would you choose?\n\nVanilla Ice. Bristol loves him!\n\nFlip or Flop Vegas, Season Premiere, Thursday, March 15, 9/8c, HGTV", "images": ["https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/prime-video.png",
