But this official end to their marriage wasn't actually the first time the couple had taken a break.\n\n\n\nHow to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of New York City on Bravo and Peacock.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New York City mom addressed several rumors surrounding her relationship during the special, one of which was that she and Tom had broken up a few times during the course of their marriage. \"Yes, we had a couple of bouts,\" Luann told Andy Cohen. \"And it happens. You know, couples argue, especially passionate ones.\"\n\nWhen Andy said that something like that \"doesn't typically happen\" in relationships, Luann agreed. \"No, not that soon,\" she said. \"I know.\"\n\nRelated\n\nLuann said that she and Tom had not, however, been fighting around the time of the wedding, as some reports speculated. In fact, Luann said that \"things were good\" after their wedding on December 31, 2016 and as we followed the couple this season of RHONY. It was only the last couple of months of their marriage that the couple began to have problems.\n\nThough Luann said that she still \"had hope\" that she could repair her relationship when she sat down with the other RHONY ladies during this season's reunion in July she said she \"was suffering.\" \"I wasn't great at the reunion, because we had had a fight the weekend before, and we stayed at the hotel,\" she explained. \"I was at the reunion and standing by my husband because I respect him. No matter what happened, I respect him, I respect our marriage. So still at the moment, I was hoping that we could work it out.\"\n\nWatch Luann explain her defense of Tom during this season of RHONY, below.", "images":
