Along with gorgeous original photographs and illustrations, as well as a few individual essays, the book is comprised of transcripts between the two of them, as they detail how they met, what their day-to-day lives look like, and much more.\n\nFrom their home in the Hollywood Hills, Mullally and Offerman talked with EW about their process creating the book as well as their love for one another. It\u2019s a winding conversation that doesn\u2019t take too long to head into some strange territory.\n\nMullally and Offerman had just received their first final, hardcover copies of the book as our interview began. Naturally, it\u2019s where we started. Read our full conversation below, and pre-order The Greatest Love Story Ever Toldahead of its Tuesday publication.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What was that moment like, when you got the final copies?\n\nMEGAN MULLALLY: They looked beautiful. The book was so beautiful. The paper \u2014 if I was reading this book and turning each page, I think it\u2019d be pleasurable. The paper is really fancy and nice.\n\nNICK OFFERMAN: It\u2019s really fun when you envision a book and write it, and in this case, we shot these amazing photos that Megan designed. When you actually see them in action \u2014 this physical artifact \u2014 there\u2019s something magical about that.\n\nMULLALLY: The photos look so good. There\u2019s some drawings by Meryl Rowin who also did all of the hand-lettering, including the cover. It looks so good. It\u2019s really exciting. There\u2019s a little more bells and whistles in this book than if we had not embellished it at all. If we had written a novel, for example.\n\nFor sure. So let\u2019s get into this: How did you decide to write a book together?\n\nMULLALLY: At first, Nick didn\u2019t want to do a book! [Laughs] That\u2019d be the main thing.\n\nOFFERMAN: I\u2019m still having second thoughts.\n\nMULLALLY: He\u2019s still having second thoughts, he says! He\u2019d written three books that were very successful, and at a certain point, I said, \u201cBased on our social media, for some reason it seems like people like us together as a couple. Every time one of us posts a photo of the two of us, people like it.\u201d I said, \u201cHey, maybe we should write a book together,\u201d and he goes, \u201cWell, what would it be?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, just like a funny book about our relationship.\u201d He said, \u201cEh, I don\u2019t really get what it would be.\u201d It went on for two years, and then finally, we were on the phone with his book editor, now my editor also, and I said, \u201cHey, what if Nick and I wrote a book together?\u201d She said, \u201cOh my God, that would be amazing.\u201d\n\nI said, \u201cWhat if it was just chapters and certain topics and we talked about stuff?\u201d Originally, we were just tape recording it to send to her to transcribe, and then we were going to polish that up and put it into prose form. But when our editor got the recording, she said, \u201cThis is really good just like it is.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just leave it like that as a he-said she-said?\u201d It really shows: This is just us talking to each other. We didn\u2019t go back in and change it or rewrite it. Those are our actual conversations. If you want to get as close as possible to knowing what our dynamic is like together as a couple, there it is.\n\nHow did you record it? The flow is very natural, in that the conversations turn incredibly weird.\n\nMULLALLY: The concept of the book was that we would have nine chapters on various topics. We just turned on the recorder on Nick\u2019s phone and laid in bed. Nick wouldn\u2019t even know in advance what the topic was going to be. I would say, \u201cWell, the topic is such-and-such,\u201d and then we would start talking. It was all very in-the-moment, spontaneous, kind of Interview magazine-style.\n\nDutton\n\nIf you could describe the feeling of the recording process, how would you?\n\nOFFERMAN: For me, it would be \u201ccomfortable.\u201d It\u2019s strange having a pleasant and successful domestic relationship. We\u2019re lucky enough to continue enjoying each other. It\u2019s that simple. We\u2019re just a couple people who like doing puzzles together. When we do things \u2014 whether it\u2019s onstage or onscreen or record a book together in a bed \u2014 it\u2019s pleasant and comfortable. We feel very lucky that we\u2019re able to do that, and that it can be a source of inspiration for people.\n\nMULLALLY: I would say \u201cpleasantly focused.\u201d It\u2019s really interesting: When we would start recording, start a new chapter, I\u2019d just close my eyes for the whole time so I didn\u2019t have any distractions, and [could] really focus on what Nick was saying. That helped me to really listen to him, rather than planning what I was going to say next in advance of him finishing what he was saying. I just wanted to be really in the moment. We did that, and also, I felt like I learned some things about Nick that I didn\u2019t really know. We heard things about each other for the first time while we were recording the book.\n\nWhat was the thing you learned that surprised you the most?\n\nMULLALLY: Things about his family. I know his family is great, very down-home and kind and cool, but it\u2019s hard for me to imagine that\u2019s that tame. Hearing him say that one time his dad got mad about something and went out the front door \u2014 which he never did; he usually went out the back door \u2014 and his mom started crying, and that was this huge thing. That blew my mind: That would have been what we did before breakfast at my house.\n\nAny topic, Nick, you were particularly surprised by?\n\nOFFERMAN: Sex. One unique thing about our marriage is that we haven\u2019t actually had sex. I feel a little shy and insecure about talking about that in public.\n\nMULLALLY: Just don\u2019t rush me.\n\nOFFERMAN: I don\u2019t feel like I am. We got through it. We eked out a chapter.\n\nMULLALLY: We set a proposed date of 2024. I think that\u2019s fair. To have sex.\n\nOFFERMAN: Yep, six years. God.\n\nMegan, you do actually say in the book, \u201cNick didn\u2019t have the trillions of sperm one might\u2019ve hoped for.\u201d\n\nMULLALLY: [Laughs loudly] It was just a conversation we were having. It just came out. I mean, it\u2019s the truth.\n\nOFFERMAN: I think that\u2019s what\u2019s commonly referred to as a fun fact.\n\nBack on track! Between the photographs and the illustrations, it\u2019s a very visual book.\n\nMULLALLY: I designed the book. Thinking about what the book should look like, I thought that we should have a photograph that would give you a loose idea of what each chapter was going to be. The titles of the chapters leave something to the imagination. I read through the chapters a few times and just tried to think which image would be best for each subject and which ones would be the funniest and the most interesting for Nick and I, specifically, to pull off. We shot all 11 setups \u2014 the nine interior photos and then the front and back photos \u2014 all in one day, which is an accomplishment. It was a pretty good day.\n\nOFFERMAN: I know it sounds like Megan did a lot of the work here, but I\u2019d like to add that I agreed to all of this. I also showed up where and when I was told and put on the clothing that was in front of me.\n\nMULLALLY: I want to add that when we were at the photo shoot, Nick would pick up a ballet tunic and be like, \u201cWhat\u2019s this for?\u201d He didn\u2019t even know we were going to do a ballet shot. He was like, \u201cOh, okay.\u201d He was very in the moment. [Laughs]\n\nOFFERMAN: It was a collaboration.\n\nThe tone weaves, and at times you both venture into more complicated, painful territory. Was there a particularly challenging topic to dredge up?\n\nMULLALLY: It was hard for me to talk about my father. I\u2019d never really talked about my father, and so that was the hardest thing for me. Nick doesn\u2019t have anything that\u2019s hard to talk about, because he\u2019s like a little twinkling bunny.\n\nIs that true, Nick?\n\nOFFERMAN: Yeah, I get described as a bunny in many ways. Twinkling. Adorable. But not well-sexed.\n\nMULLALLY: We\u2019ve gotten him a couple of manuals. He\u2019s studying up for 2024, but we\u2019ll see if he\u2019s there by then. We\u2019ll have to give him a few quizzes and stuff beforehand, so we\u2019ll see if he\u2019s reading the literature he\u2019s been provided.\n\nI think BuzzFeed has a few quizzes that are good for that.\n\nOFFERMAN: I\u2019m all over it.\n\nMULLALLY: BuzzFeed gives him a sunny.\n\nOFFERMAN: [Groans]\n\nWhat?\n\nMULLALLY: [Laughing] I said, just the word BuzzFeed gives him a chub.\n\nOFFERMAN: Can you guys please stop saying that word? It seriously hurts.\n\nIf Megan can agree to that, I\u2019m good with that.\n\nOFFERMAN: All right.\n\nMULLALLY: BuzzFeed.\n\nOFFERMAN: The chafing.\n\nBack on track! So Nick, you didn\u2019t initially want to write a book with Megan. Tell me why from your perspective.\n\nOFFERMAN: I can\u2019t keep this up, David. This is George Clooney. Nick is shooting in Vancouver, and I like to come over. They have a really nice shuffleboard court here in the hills.\n\nBut seriously, the books I\u2019ve done previously have been really enjoyable, but a hustle, and a lot of hard work. There were specific things that I wanted to address in book form. I love doing anything creative with Megan \u2014 especially because she does all the work, so it\u2019s a really fun collaboration for me. For me to sign onto something, someone has to say, \u201cHere it is, here\u2019s what it is, will you play?\u201d Without that \u2014 when it\u2019s just pitched like, \u201cWe should write a book together\u201d \u2014 I\u2019m usually not looking to add anything to my calendar.\n\nIn all honesty, there was a sexual negotiation involved. I was able to take four years off of Megan\u2019s deadline. When we got married, it was 2032, and so we\u2019re down to 2024. I\u2019ll do another goddamn book. I\u2019ll write a trilogy. I\u2019ll write it in Braille. I don\u2019t give a shit.\n\nYou\u2019ll have to write it fast.\n\nMULLALLY: [Laughing loudly]\n\nOFFERMAN: I\u2019m doing everything I can here, buddy.\n\nDo either of you have a favorite chapter?\n\nOFFERMAN: When you ask that question, what springs to mind is, every time I\u2019ve read through the book, Megan makes me laugh so hard with her candor. When she answers me in a hilarious and curt way, it makes me laugh out loud every time. That\u2019s my favorite thing about the book. Rather than pick a favorite chapter, I\u2019ll pick a favorite characteristic. I think it really captures the dynamic of us together \u2014 whether we\u2019re talking about something serious and emotional or something more lightweight. We weigh in with all of our faculties, but we also like to make each other laugh.\n\nMULLALLY: I have a favorite photograph: The big ballet lift. We took maybe seven photos because Nick had to hold me like that and it wasn\u2019t very comfortable. We got a great big mirror into the photo studio, and then that way, Nick could look in the mirror and we could be sure that our lines were the same and the position was just right before we shot it. That was helpful.\n\nOFFERMAN: Hearing Megan say that, it did occur to me that I do have a favorite chapter, which is the acknowledgments. It\u2019s succinct and really gets to the point.\n\nYou may be the first author to say that.\n\nOFFERMAN: I\u2019ve been accused of thinking outside the box, and Megan, as a legal requirement, has me thinking outside the box for another six years. That\u2019s the state of affairs over here.\n\nLast question: Is there a sequel to The Greatest Love Story Ever Told?\n\nOFFERMAN: We do have an idea. Honey, I\u2019ll let you tell him about it.\n\nMULLALLY: I don\u2019t know what the joke is. But we have talked about the fact that we could do other books because it\u2019s just us talking about stuff together and since things are always changing, there will always be material for us to delve into. So yeah, I think it\u2019d be fun to do another book, or more. Nick\u2019s going to prison, so we\u2019ll probably have to do a lot of it via the U.S. mail. It\u2019ll be like love letters. But his letters will just be coming from prison.\n\nSounds romantic.\n\nOFFERMAN: The proposed title for book two is Patience.", "images": ["https://ew.com/thmb/L7jVh_qiQZ6C6ZbYoiG4qkV54aY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/harry-potter-chamber-secrets-jason-isaacs-tom-felton-042125-6e9931e27b824c3c8f057e2879ba3652.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/ia_5DcqE551_WPafPT_LaUmG1uc=/200x200/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/creditAlexAdams-2000-f975258f381741dcb29489096bb8f294.jpeg", "https://ew.com/thmb/abpG8IWHCDvY7DNcqNBC7OiJmEk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nick-offerman-taylor-swift-travis-kelce-101625-362ad8b9cf6b454daed5240f18e2a5cb.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/qyZ7XIwrJrzBKbmjectPNlawR8s=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lucille-Ball-Cameron-Crowe-and-Cary-Grant-101425-b6718fc594514ffd9745b4368e98ec60.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/32gHwFbMvpyL1axxUdXk2dNC57w=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Laurence-Fishburne-Professor-Xavier-101425-016a00071b5940e8adbfe595bce5e8e7.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/hnhMorA30wGrqRud_w3G-iJ_NFo=/2000x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/9781101986677-2000-27b62462b3e04f3181a5cdc10303ff7a.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/Jy6cPXIOj6m1qi1SyIetKnQeBms=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cho_8-2000-645f87ba1d7a4349bfa911fead6561c1.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/1ipwbhz3AVKvGdjncta-W8QNhik=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/DeathbyLightning-110325-01-a91ff82977c747269f253cdfe057266c.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/yzj_yvxFx_pqkKUDx80hV97botk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/interview-with-the-vampire-amc-4-092925-fa6657c57cfc4c2dbb60b0558893b1e8.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/4UO-SNfXzwjvE8fv1V_ItK-aduA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Cole-Escola-Bon-Clay-110325-ad50c60a3e25473a8fe21959dc43c007.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/OonidCy3U-_XbQW7j5tuCwZnpKQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/James-Garfield-Death-by-Lightning-111025-1402b566b1304bc99aac8818ae76398f.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/U1hLy7UsLRTXhvHdA7fk47RsV2o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/jim-oheir-nick-offerman-parks-and-recreation-112224-bdfaee2e71ef468ea9c7e15ceae57a24.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/6q2bQ2zhJ6Dcd5-2i30GK7bUGhQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kiera-Knightley-JK-Rowling-101225-fa5e1b9e23f3424f9a57f2557d9ee539.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/AzA6zJxgsutcozXYE2BPCvSiOT8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jim-Carrey-and-Taylor-Momsen-HOW-THE-GRINCH-STOLE-CHRISTMAS-110525-accd71e38f7c470b97d4fa56d86edf8e.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/6wKzXgEEeOY70EleUHeXbeVyNxY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Jennifer-Lawrence-Robert-Pattinson-110925-13d8ff681bb743d5a2dfd22da8b3e6de.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/Jnl7mYYc5iJLj2Xtj4embE0ExoU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/colleen-hoover-112025-7dbef409e1d044d697c1d5093b788121.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/bIO9z7E0-Lo1l5vB1AcH0VnUl3M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-grinch-carrey-momsen-11925-e40dd1bcc58b45d19cb147c57be3ec51.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/cZV71hvHs6Doea86NJh3UX7kGME=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Aziz-Ansari-Nick-Offerman-Parks-and-Rec-101425-1-f86ade5ae28e43659a0425a72baaf487.jpg", "https://ew.com/thmb/4FicUtxlTjfvb--CYzWWgCUIzhA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/anthony-abigail-hopkins-110425-50b800a52e114aef997930beacc94385.jpg"], "top_img": "https://ew.com/thmb/Jy6cPXIOj6m1qi1SyIetKnQeBms=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/cho_8-2000-645f87ba1d7a4349bfa911fead6561c1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David Canfield Is A Former Staff Editor At Entertainment Weekly.
