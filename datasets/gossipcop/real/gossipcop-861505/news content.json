Putting together all this trauma and religious zealousness and abuse that I don\u2019t know anything about, that really intrigued me as an actress.\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, Jessica Biel was raising her baby boy with husband Justin Timberlake in their Hollywood Hills home when the actress got hooked on a book. Universal Cable Productions sent her a thriller by German crime novelist Petra Hammesfahr, and once Biel started reading \u201cThe Sinner,\u201d she couldn\u2019t put it down. \u201cEvery time I thought I knew where the story was going, it surprised me,\u201d she says. \u201cI liked the book\u2019s subversive quality. It was an impressive read.\u201d\n\nThose subversive elements, embodied in the deeply damaged title character, proved irresistible to Biel. She explains, \u201cI hadn\u2019t worked on screen for a year, so I was ready to take the knife and let my guts spill out everywhere because I had all this creative energy that needed to be expelled. This was a leap into the darkest of the dark.\u201d\n\nOn this day, the sun streaming into a penthouse at AKA Beverly Hills, where Biel, wearing a violet pantsuit with a cream coat draped over her shoulders, cheerfully details her deep dive into \u201cThe Sinner.\u201d \u201cIt was exciting to play this unreliable character who lies out of self-preservation and because she\u2019s afraid to expose parts of herself she believes are heinous and shameful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA hit for USA Network last summer, the limited series earned Biel a Golden Globe best actress nomination for her nuanced portrayal of mom/wife/shattered soul Cora. The character\u2019s psychotic break happens in the first episode. During a picnic by the lake with her husband and young son, Cora gets enraged by a loud song and abruptly stabs a stranger to death in a blood-spattered rage.\n\nWhy\u2019d she do it?\n\nSeeking answers, the eight-episode thriller gradually reveals Cora\u2019s toxic backstory, contaminated with psychologically abusive parents, a sickly sister and predatory men in masks. \u201cOther people can do whodunit really well,\u201d Biel says. \u201cWe\u2019re interested in the conceit of the \u2018whydunit,\u2019 so we peel, peel, peel away. It\u2019s about the psychological peel.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiel\u2019s star turn in \u201cThe Sinner\u201d represents a startling departure for the 36-year-old actress, first introduced to TV audiences as a minister\u2019s wholesome teenage daughter in The WB\u2019s long-running family drama \u201c7th Heaven.\u201d She later appeared in the 2003 horror reboot of \u201cThe Texas Chainsaw Massacre\u201d followed by an eclectic mix of action flicks, rom-coms, guest roles and voiceover gigs.\n\nWith \u201cThe Sinner,\u201d Biel broke new ground by probing a character she has almost nothing in common with. \u201cGrowing up totally normal, I had cool, loving parents, went to school. I worked professionally, which was a little bit unusual, but in terms of dynamic there\u2019s nothing to really say except \u2018Thumbs up.\u2019 And I don\u2019t want to play that! It\u2019s boring! I want to find characters I\u2019m terrified to portray.\u201d\n\nMy entry point for Cora was partly that we\u2019re both moms, so I had compassion for her in that way. \u2014 Jessica Biel\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiel did manage to identify with Cora in one regard. \u201cMy entry point for Cora was partly that we\u2019re both moms, so I had compassion for her in that way,\u201d she says. \u201cBut the attraction also had to do with the fact that Cora has so many layers. Putting together all this trauma and religious zealousness and abuse that I don\u2019t know anything about, that really intrigued me as an actress.\u201d\n\nCora\u2019s fitfully remembered past includes a complicated relationship with her bossy younger sister Phoebe (Nadia Alexander), whose options are constrained because of a congenital heart defect. Incest ensues. Biel says, \u201cThat scene was odd to film and uncomfortable to watch. But Phoebe needs that physical release because she doesn\u2019t feel that she\u2019ll ever be touched or loved or caressed. Cora can\u2019t say no. She did it out of love.\u201d\n\nBeyond her contributions as an actress, Biel exercised considerable measure of creative control over \u201cThe Sinner\u201d through her Iron Ocean Productions company. She and producing partner Michelle Purple enlisted show runner Derek Simonds (\u201cThe Astronaut Wives Club\u201d) to create the series and personally pitched their concept to network execs. Biel, who continues as an executive producer for \u201cThe Sinner\u201d Season 2, which will star Carrie Coon, liked being listened to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such a powerful feeling to have people look to you and say \u2018What do you think?\u2019 Actors often don\u2019t have any input at all, but I\u2019d been living with \u2018The Sinner\u2019 longer than almost anybody, so I had a point of view about the material. This show definitely felt like my baby.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Video Q&A\u2019s from this season\u2019s hottest contenders \u00bb\n\ncalendar@latimes.com", "images":
