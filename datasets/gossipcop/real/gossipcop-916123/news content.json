Here\u2019s a sampling (we\u2019ll update periodically):\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nhttps://twitter.com/alxwinter/status/1027296510289960960\n\nThe #Oscars are adding a category \"Best Popular Film.\" Good Luck Chuck is coming back in rerelease! \u2014 Dane Cook (@DaneCook) August 8, 2018\n\n.@TheSimpsons Next: everyone gets an Oscar day. \u2014 Al Jean (@AlJean) August 8, 2018\n\nDear @TheAcademy, creating a 'popular' oscar category delegitimizes the integrity of every other award. Please honor our business and not make tele-cast based decision to try and improve ratings. In other words, we have have 90 years of Oscar Magic. Don't fuck it up. \u2014 Ian Bohen (@IanBohen) August 8, 2018\n\nThe film business passed away today with the announcement of the \u201cpopular\u201d film Oscar. It had been in poor health for a number of years. It is survived by sequels, tent-poles, and vertical integration. \u2014 Rob Lowe (@RobLowe) August 8, 2018\n\nFinally the Oscars will be giving a statue based on popularity so that those poor mountains of box office money won\u2019t be lonely anymore \u2014 Andy Richter (@AndyRichter) August 8, 2018\n\nSeems the Oscars are adding Best Popular Film category. Can best Non-Human Performance be far behind? \u2014 Brent Spiner (@BrentSpiner) August 8, 2018\n\nI was just saying Hollywood needs to be encouraged more officially to focus more on box office, less on quality https://t.co/X9Z3ozmOFh \u2014 Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) August 8, 2018\n\n\u201cOutstanding Popular film?\u201d The Oscars are basically creating an attendance award. Ugh. \u2014 Mike Flanagan (@flanaganfilm) August 8, 2018\n\nOh, Christ. AMPAS just announced that it will be presenting some awards off the air, and creating a new category to honor \"popular films.\" These are bad, pandering, desperation-based decisions and I hope they reconsider. > \u2014 Mark Harris (@MarkHarrisNYC) August 8, 2018\n\nOscars should be determined by popular vote at the mall!! \u2014 Paul Brittain (@PaulBrittain3) August 8, 2018\n\nHearing from so many millenials today who cannot wait to watch the Oscars now. \u2014 billy eichner (@billyeichner) August 8, 2018\n\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Toure/status/1027300271381274624", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/oscar-statuettes.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/oscar-statuettes.jpg?w=1024", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/oscar-statuettes.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Greg Evans", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/08/popular-oscar-hollywood-reaction-twitter-rob-lowe-andy-richter-1202442667/", "title": "Most Popular Oscar May Not Be So Popular: Rob Lowe Tweets, \u201cFilm Business Passed Away Today\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "A new Oscar category for \"popular\" films doesn't seem very popular among Hollywood insiders.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Greg Evans", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Most Popular Oscar May Not Be So Popular: Rob Lowe Tweets, \u201cFilm Business Passed Away Today\u201d", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/08/popular-oscar-hollywood-reaction-twitter-rob-lowe-andy-richter-1202442667/", "description": "A new Oscar category for \"popular\" films doesn't seem very popular among Hollywood insiders.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/oscar-statuettes.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 654, "alt": "Oscars"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-08-08T19:16:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2024-12-19T01:27:13+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "A new Oscar category for \"popular\" films doesn't seem very popular among Hollywood insiders.", "site": "@Deadline", "creator": "@GregEvans5", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Most Popular Oscar May Not Be So Popular: Rob Lowe Tweets, \u201cFilm Business Passed Away Today\u201d", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/oscar-statuettes.jpg?w=1024"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533755813.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
