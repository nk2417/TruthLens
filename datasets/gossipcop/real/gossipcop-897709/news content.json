What a great set he had,\" Payne told the crowd during his set, before posting a photo of their reunion on Instagram.\n\n\"@niallhoran good to see you bro,\" he wrote, while Horan replied, \"You too bud. Great few days. See you at home.\"\n\nThough One Direction went on hiatus in early 2016, the singers have reunited several times this year. Horan and Payne were both at KIIS-FM's 2017 Wango Tango music festival in Los Angeles and at the ZPL Birthday Bash in Indianapolis.\n\nZayn Malik, however, admitted this fall that he's lost touch with his One Direction bandmates.\n\n\"Our relationships have definitely changed since we were in a band together, but I think that\u2019s just life,\u201d the 24-year-old singer told Billboard. \u201cEverybody grows up; two of the guys have got kids now. But no, I don\u2019t talk to any of them, really.\u201d\n\nSee more on the band in the video below.", "images": ["https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/weather-icons/mostly-cloudy-night_210x210.png", "https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/ccfbabe6-2dea-4754-a17a-95661a3cd47c/20251119T220402/ccfbabe6-2dea-4754-a17a-95661a3cd47c_360x203.jpg", "https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/logos/kusa.png", "https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/e6e08cc1-91c1-4a8e-b00e-71934ef054b2/20251119T103639/e6e08cc1-91c1-4a8e-b00e-71934ef054b2_360x203.jpg", "https://media.9news.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/6286472a-4ee1-4926-a2c6-33b37e9f7a23/20251120T034510/6286472a-4ee1-4926-a2c6-33b37e9f7a23_360x203.jpg", "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/12/02/gettyimages-884045016_11860365_ver1.0.jpg", "https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/icons/facebook.svg", "https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/logos/native/kusa.svg", "https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/icons/close-menu.svg"], "top_img": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/12/02/gettyimages-884045016_11860365_ver1.0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.9news.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-tonight/niall-horan-and-liam-payne-have-one-direction-reunion-at-jingle-ball/73-496442856", "title": "Niall Horan and Liam Payne Have One Direction Reunion at Jingle Ball", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#045ea8", "category": "entertainment", "og": {"url": "https://www.9news.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-tonight/niall-horan-and-liam-payne-have-one-direction-reunion-at-jingle-ball/73-496442856", "title": "Niall Horan and Liam Payne Have One Direction Reunion at Jingle Ball", "description": "Fate brought Niall Horan and Liam Payne in one direction on Friday night!", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/12/02/gettyimages-884045016_11860365_ver1.0.jpg", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "12/2/2017 9:15:03 PM"}, "site_name": "KUSA.com", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "section": "9news,entertainment,entertainment-tonight"}, "twitter": {"title": "Niall Horan and Liam Payne Have One Direction Reunion at Jingle Ball", "image": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/12/02/gettyimages-884045016_11860365_ver1.0.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "9NEWS", "description": "Fate brought Niall Horan and Liam Payne in one direction on Friday night!", "domain": "www.9news.com/"}, "viewport": "width=1170", "site": "9news.com", "description": "Fate brought Niall Horan and Liam Payne in one direction on Friday night!", "fb": {"app_id": 1760372210700146}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512267303.0, "source": "https://www.9news.com", "summary": ""}
