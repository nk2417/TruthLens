That happily ever after witnessed in the 2003 Dawson\u2019s Creek finale may not have lasted after all. The finale revealed that Joey (Katie Holmes) chose Pacey (Joshua Jackson) and the two were living together in New York. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Dawson (James Van Der Beek) had become a successful director and finally secured a meeting with his idol, Steven Spielberg.\n\nRelated: Dawson\u2019s Creek Cast Reunites for 20th Anniversary: Pics Together again! The Dawson\u2019s Creek cast has reunited 20 years after the 1998 premiere of the beloved teen drama. Former costars James Van Der Beek, Katie Holmes, Joshua Jackson and Michelle Williams joined forces for the cover of the new issue of Entertainment Weekly. Scroll down to see all five covers of the gang and [\u2026]\n\nSo what would happen next, if creator Kevin Williamson was to bring back the series today?\n\n\u201cI think Pacey and Joey got married. I think they had a family, I think there were troubles. I think they got a divorce,\u201d the writer and producer told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cI think that when we meet them they\u2019re in a very dark place. But there\u2019s still something between them that forces them to come together and raise their children. As they seek out happiness with others, they just keep coming back to each other. And they just can\u2019t stop that magical thing that exists between them and that bond they have. I think we would sort of have to watch them fall in love all over again as middle-aged adults.\u201d\n\nRelated: TV Reboots and Revivals From sitcoms and game shows to dramas and cartoons, the list of TV reboots and revivals is a long one. Waiting to Exhale and Conan the Barbarian are both films being made into TV shows, while Gilmore Girls was transformed into four seasons for its Netflix revival, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, which [\u2026]\n\nHe also gave an update on where Dawson would be \u2014 and apparently that meeting with Spielberg didn\u2019t go too well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a man of conflict. I would want to, of course, show some conflict. I think Dawson became Spielberg, all his dreams came true. I think they shattered,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI think he fell apart. I think he never really found love and, when we come upon him, he\u2019s just on the cusp of changing his whole life and finding the one thing that\u2019s going to make it magical.\u201d\n\nRelated: \u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 Cast: Then and Now See how Katie Holmes, James Van Der Beek, Michelle Williams and Joshua Jackson have grown since being cast on The WB series in 1998\n\nLuckily, fans will not see these heartbreaking story lines turn into reality. Williamson also revealed during the interview that he isn\u2019t interested in bringing the show back, but wouldn\u2019t mind watching a new writer take on the challenge. (Let\u2019s hope that writer is less about conflict!)\n\nVan Der Beek, Jackson and Holmes were joined by Michelle Williams, Busy Phillips, Meredith Monroe, Kerr Smith and Mary Beth Peil for a full 20th anniversary reunion.\n\nDawson\u2019s Creek is currently streaming on Hulu.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
