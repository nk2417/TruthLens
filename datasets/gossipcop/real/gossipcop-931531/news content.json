I don't understand why people like this? It's trash and not even the fun kind. Rated 0.5/5 Stars \u2022 Rated 0.5 out of 5 stars 10/27/25 Full Review Olivia J It's got strands of DNA from Gone Girl, Bad Moms, The Ice Storm and Frank Perry's near-lost Compromising Positions, and it's a candy-colored cupcake made with buttercream and bile about those who strive to maintain the illusion of perfection. Rated 4.5/5 Stars \u2022 Rated 4.5 out of 5 stars 10/15/25 Full Review Will N I wanted to like the movie. Complaint #1: She invited Kendrick to help solve \"who done it\" if something happens, because she's supposedly an expert at it, but she figures out nothing the entire movie. She spends the whole time with a puzzled look on her face, and has the whole plot spelled out for her at the end. Complaint #2: They never even mentioned why her mother wears a wig. Poor character development Complaint #3: Midway through the movie, out of right field, there's a dude jacking off in the shower, and not even in a comedic way. It was gross. WTF. No thanks. Rated 0.5/5 Stars \u2022 Rated 0.5 out of 5 stars 09/22/25 Full Review Siddharth B Nancy Drew: The Case of the Killer Martini. Rated 4/5 Stars \u2022 Rated 4 out of 5 stars 08/28/25 Full Review Mike M The multiple twists in this are done well imo. Rated 3.5/5 Stars \u2022 Rated 3.5 out of 5 stars 07/25/25 Full Review Andrea B A Simple Favor is a Gone Girl that takes itself less seriously and succeeds very well precisely because of this. Despite a \"small\" difference in the ending compared to the book, the movie remains faithful to the book on which it is based. Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively both give spectacular performances, especially Blake who (evidently) had a lot of fun playing her character.
