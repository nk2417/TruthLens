The pair became engaged in 2012 before calling off the engagement in 2013. After quietly resuming their relationship earlier this year, Cyrus raised a few eyebrows when she posted a photo to Instagram in which she\u2019s wearing her old engagement ring.\n\nGiven her history of provocative social media posts, no one could quite be sure if the return of the ring was an indication of their on-again engagement or if she just happened to think the accessory worked with her strawberry-inspired outfit of the day.\n\nA photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Jan 18, 2016 at 7:07am PST\n\nHowever, during an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Thursday afternoon, an overall-wearing Cyrus confirmed to DeGeneres that the pair are once again engaged.\n\nThe talk-show host congratulated the 23-year-old, to which Cyrus replied, \u201cIt\u2019s very weird because this is, like, real jewelry, and most of my jewelry is made out of gummy bears and cotton candy. They don\u2019t look that good together because they kind of mix up.\u201d\n\nShe continued, in the way only Miley can, \u201cSometimes I replace it with an actual unicorn or a Looney Tune, and he\u2019s kind of like, What\u2019s going on?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018This isn\u2019t really my aesthetic, but I\u2019ll wear it because you love me.'\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liam_hemsworth_and_miley_cyrus_-_split_-_h_-_2016.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liam_hemsworth_and_miley_cyrus_-_split_-_h_-_2016.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Reed", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/miley-cyrus-confirms-shes-engaged-liam-hemsworth-again-941714/", "title": "Miley Cyrus Confirms She\u2019s Engaged to Liam Hemsworth (Again)", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Mazel tov.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Sam Reed", "tags": "Miley Cyrus, Style News", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Miley Cyrus Confirms She\u2019s Engaged to Liam Hemsworth (Again)", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/miley-cyrus-confirms-shes-engaged-liam-hemsworth-again-941714/", "description": "Mazel tov.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liam_hemsworth_and_miley_cyrus_-_split_-_h_-_2016.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Miley Cyrus Confirms She's Engaged Liam Hemsworth (Again)"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-10-27T10:15:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-10-27T13:05:24+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Mazel tov.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Miley Cyrus Confirms She\u2019s Engaged to Liam Hemsworth (Again)", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/liam_hemsworth_and_miley_cyrus_-_split_-_h_-_2016.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1477563348.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
