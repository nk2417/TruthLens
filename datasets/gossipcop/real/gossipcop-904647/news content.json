My friend said to me that I literally gave her a Hollywood ending.\u201d\n\nIt looked like that\u2019s exactly what she got after the show at the InStyle/Warner Bros. Pictures bash, where she posed for many selfies (and danced to DJ Michelle Pesce) and even got to hold Janney\u2019s best supporting actress trophy. \u201cI love that she\u2019s here,\u201d Janney said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we exonerate her, but we absolutely make people think twice of what they thought of her when this incident happened, and to have some empathy for her looking at the kind of mother she had. That\u2019s got to feel good for her to have that.\u201d\n\nShe also got some face time with The Disaster Artist himself, Tommy Wiseau. The two posed for photos together while Wiseau also showed up on Joe Jonas\u2019 Instagram. Earlier, on the red carpet, THR asked Wiseau whom he would like to meet in a roomful of stars, but Wiseau swatted away any indication that he gets starstruck.\n\n\u201cI treat everybody the same way. Actors are actors, a lot of people are doing a good job. I support them \u2014 ironically, they support me,\u201d Wiseau said, wearing his signature black sunglasses and a Burberry tux. \u201cI\u2019m not like you with what you ask me. A person is a person. You can put President Obama here, it doesn\u2019t affect me like it affects you. I treat everyone equally.\u201d\n\nWiseau was certainly treated like a star during the evening; he was even invited onstage during James Franco\u2019s best actor win for playing a version of him in The Disaster Artist. That was until Franco pushed him away from the microphone. Still, he said Franco deserved the trophy. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to make a movie about a bad movie, whatever you call it. I call it the best movie ever, what about that!\u201c", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com//sites/default/files/custom/Annie/unnamed-1.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tonya_harding_and_tommy_wiseau_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2018_0.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tonya_harding_and_tommy_wiseau_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2018_0.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Gardner", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/golden-globes-inside-tonya-harding-tommy-wiseaus-epic-night-1073381/", "title": "Golden Globes: Inside Tonya Harding and Tommy Wiseau\u2019s Epic Night Out", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The mastermind of 'The Room' tells THR that he doesn't get starstruck: &quot;You can put President Obama here, it doesn't affect me like it affects you.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Chris Gardner", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Golden Globes: Inside Tonya Harding and Tommy Wiseau\u2019s Epic Night Out", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/golden-globes-inside-tonya-harding-tommy-wiseaus-epic-night-1073381/", "description": "The mastermind of 'The Room' tells THR that he doesn't get starstruck: \"You can put President Obama here, it doesn't affect me like it affects you.
