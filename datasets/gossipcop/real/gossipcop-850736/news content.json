Venue/Marquee \u2013 \u00a365,000\n\nAlthough the reception is being hosted at the Middleton's home, they are still expecting 350 guests, meaning a huge - and deluxe - marquee is required.\n\nView 6 Images Pippa is very close to her family and her parents will be hosting the reception (Image: Sunday Mirror)\n\nThis, Bridebook estimates, will start at \u00a325,000 but can easily go much higher.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nEven though it's May, that's no guarantee of good weather either.\n\nSo it may be there's another marquee for drinks in case it rains, plus a fully-equipped catering tent.\n\n2. Food \u2013 \u00a370,000\n\nPippa and James are used to a certain lifestyle, and no doubt will want to feed and water their guests well.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nA tip-top London caterer will charge over \u00a3170 per guest for catering.\n\nView 6 Images A food enthusiast, Pippa is bound to put on a good spread\n\nThis includes all food, chefs and staffing, glassware and crockery hire, and linen hire.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nBecause their reception is in a marquee, an extra level of staffing is required, increasing Pippa's catering costs to around \u00a3200 per guest, of which she's inviting 350.\n\nAll you need to know about James Matthews\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n3. The dress \u2013 \u00a310,000\n\nPerhaps the one detail eagle-eyes wedding watchers are keen to see, Pippa's gown is rumoured to the handiwork of designer Giles Deacon and will, of course, be bespoke.\n\nView 6 Images Pippa wore Sarah Burton on her sister's big day\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nGiles also designed Abbey Clancy's wedding dress, which set her back a cool \u00a310,000.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\n4.Booze \u2013 \u00a317,720\n\nLet's face it, it's probably not going to be a cash bar.\n\nBridebook worked out around 233 bottles of champagne alone will be drunk to keep the guests topped up during the drinks reception and speeches.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nThe sort of champagne on offer will cost around \u00a39,320. Plus there'll be fine wines for the wedding breakfast and open-bar cocktails for the evening.\n\nCheeky young prince upstages royal family with his mischievous antics during balcony appearance READ MORE :\n\nView 6 Images Hands up who likes champagne?\n\n5. Rings \u2013 \u00a319,900\n\nAnother five-figured cost - and the pressure is on for best man Spencer Matthews to keep a tight hold on the wedding bands, which are rumoured to be from Cartier.\n\n\u200c\n\n\n\nA diamond encrusted wedding ring for Pippa will cost \u00a315,500 whilst a platinum band for James would be \u00a31440.\n\nView 6 Images Let's hope \"Spenny\" remembers the
