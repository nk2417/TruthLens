The terms of their separation and the custody agreement over their young daughters, London and Rylee, remains confidential.\n\n\u201cIt was an amicable divorce,\u201d Emmett\u2019s rep told Page Six on Wednesday. \u201cThey have a healthy co-parenting relationship for their children.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cPower\u201d producer, 46, first filed for separation from Childers, 29, in April 2015, but he asked the court to dismiss his petition in May 2016. Childers filed for divorce in January 2017 after Kent, 27, was accused of having an affair with an unnamed married man on \u201cVanderpump Rules.\u201d\n\nThe #GiveThemLala beauty queen first appeared on Season 4 (2015-2016) of the Bravo hit show and came under fire for her love life during Season 5 (2016-2017). She quit the show midway through the season over her castmates\u2019 claims that her over-the-top lifestyle was paid for by her then-anonymous boyfriend, but finally confessed that her Range Rover was paid for by someone else and the lies she made about her relationship gave her anxiety when she returned for Season 6 (which is currently on air).\n\nKent only mentioned Emmett\u2019s name while asking a casino worker where he was in a now-deleted Instagram story from Las Vegas, but Page Six caught the couple kissing at an event in Beverly Hills earlier this month.\n\nChilders\u2019 rep did not immediately return our request for comment.\n\nKent\u2019s rep didn\u2019t get back to us.", "images": ["https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fblomingdales.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115847739.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2FFF-WP.png?w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115916411.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115879604.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115838388.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115875312.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115742458.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/kevin-spacey-homeless.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115820363.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115838388.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115879604.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/paige2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115886570.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115883447.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Felemis-black-friday.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1763642967&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115883447.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/ambyr-childers-randall-emmett-lala-kent.png?w=744", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115886570.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/ambyr-childers-randall-emmett-lala-kent.png?w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115874796.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115918332.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/ambyr-childers-randall-emmett-lala-kent.png?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/12/27/lala-kents-married-man-officially-divorced/", "title": "Lala Kent\u2019s married man officially divorced", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
