Feeling very proud.\"\n\n\"Couldn\u2019t be more proud @blakelively! 61 pounds in 14 months after baby number 2!\" Saladino captioned a matching snap on his own account. \"Doesn\u2019t she look awesome?\"\n\nNeed a news break?

Lively's regimen called for five or six workouts a week, with sessions lasting from 30 to 75 minutes.\n\n\"She never questions me. She always does what I want her to do,\" Saladino said, praising his client's can-do attitude, while still being understanding of her needs as a new mom. \"If she comes in, and being like any other mom, she was up all night with the baby and didn't sleep well, I'm not going to beat the crap out of her. That's the worst thing to do for someone.\"", "images": ["https://www.usatoday.com/gciaf/prod/p?a=pageview&p=USAT-TEALIUM-TANGENT&m=web&k=f14ebdd6-0569-4c64-af73-99937bc06379&s=noscript", "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/1e480f6330c3e7a6815fdd24b7a643f3544eec9a/c=0-21-1925-1108/local/-/media/2018/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636541071119702458-GTY-675605028-90617842.JPG?width=1925&height=1087&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/1e480f6330c3e7a6815fdd24b7a643f3544eec9a/c=0-21-1925-1108/local/-/media/2018/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636541071119702458-GTY-675605028-90617842.JPG?width=1925&height=1087&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/02/13/blake-lively-shows-off-61-pound-post-baby-weight-loss-feeling-very-proud/332377002/", "title": "Blake Lively shows off 61-pound post-baby weight loss: 'Feeling very proud'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Blake Lively shows off 61-pound post-baby weight loss: 'Feeling very proud'", "description": "Lively welcomed her second child in September 2016.", "url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/02/13/blake-lively-shows-off-61-pound-post-baby-weight-loss-feeling-very-proud/332377002/", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/1e480f6330c3e7a6815fdd24b7a643f3544eec9a/c=0-21-1925-1108/local/-/media/2018/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636541071119702458-GTY-675605028-90617842.JPG?width=1925&height=1087&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 1925, "height": 1087}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Maeve McDermott", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Lively welcomed her second child in September 2016.", "fb": {"pages": "13652355666,48958576760,156345381090801,110471702456365,6566864515,137698179626815,315942225236045,927427260614748,183850168300771,1443524575938047,251228454889939,158095147555989,115535341805950,236655713446291,1621466394844549,250325640686,177037772444433,1972936962947967,2047091012096533,535551216797440", "app_id": 1279862243338849}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/1e480f6330c3e7a6815fdd24b7a643f3544eec9a/c=0-21-1925-1108/local/-/media/2018/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636541071119702458-GTY-675605028-90617842.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "title": "Blake Lively shows off 61-pound post-baby weight loss: 'Feeling very proud'", "description": "Lively welcomed her second child in September 2016."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518498000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
