For me\u2026Elsa\u2019s every day telling me where she needs to go, and she\u2019ll continue to tell us. I always write from character-out, and where Elsa is and what Elsa\u2019s doing in her life, she\u2019s telling me every day. We\u2019ll see where we go.\u201d\n\nHuffPost correctly labeled that noncommittal response a \u201cglimmer of hope\u201d for the #GiveElsaAGirlfriend campaign, which sprouted up on social media in 2016. Others have been more generous in their assessment: \u201cRing The Alarm!\u201d BuzzFeed declared. \u201cElsa Might Have A Girlfriend In The \u2018Frozen\u2019 Sequel.\u201d But it\u2019s safe to say that we can un-ring that bell. If you think there\u2019s a serious chance Elsa will find same-sex love in Arendelle, it\u2019s probably best to let that hope go. Disney has been down this road before.\n\n\u201c For the last few years now, Disney has walked a delicate tightrope between not shutting down LGBT fans who want to see better representation in their films and not pissing off homophobic viewers. \u201d\n\nRemember when eagle-eyed fans spotted a lesbian-looking couple in the Finding Dory trailer, creating mounting speculation that we\u2019d see definitively LGBT representation in a Pixar movie, only for the film\u2019s co-director to give the cop-out answer, \u201cThey can be whatever you want them to be?\u201d\n\nOr when the director of the live-action Beauty and the Beast remake promised an \u201cexclusively gay moment,\u201d angering social conservatives, only for Gaston\u2019s sidekick LeFou to be briefly spotted dancing with another man in the film\u2019s finale? (As my Daily Beast colleague Kevin Fallon wrote, \u201cTruth be told, the most exclusively gay moment in this new Beauty and the Beast is my dramatic eye roll after seeing the actual thing.\u201d)\n\nDisney\u2019s biggest PG-13 property has disappointed LGBT fans as well.\n\nIn 2016, director J.J. Abrams told The Daily Beast that he \u201cwould love it\u201d if there were a gay character in Star Wars and that \u201cit seems insanely narrow-minded and counterintuitive to say that there wouldn\u2019t be a homosexual character in that world.\u201d Yet there are still no confirmed gay people to be found in the new films\u2014despite some fans\u2019 rigorous shipping of Finn and Poe. (And now that yet another Star Wars trilogy has been announced, there will be three more opportunities to depict a galaxy far, far away where, apparently, gay people either do not exist or live in hiding.)\n\nFor the last few years now, Disney has walked a delicate tightrope between not shutting down LGBT fans who want to see better representation in their films and not pissing off homophobic viewers. There\u2019s no reason to expect them to stop toeing that line until it\u2019s safe for the film giant to throw their full weight behind the LGBT community.\n\nAs the LGBT media advocacy group GLAAD noted in 2017, Walt Disney Studios \u201chas the weakest historical record when it comes to LGBTQ-inclusive films\u201d out of all the big studios. Disney\u2019s got a family-friendly reputation to protect, and at a time when many Americans still think that children need to be protected from LGBT \u201ccorruption\u201d\u201437 percent of respondents to one recent GLAAD survey, for example, said they would be uncomfortable with their child learning about LGBT history in school\u2014a lesbian or bisexual Snow Queen is probably perceived as an unnecessary financial risk.\n\nAccording to Fast Company writer Joe Berkowitz, the \u201cmost family-friendly studio on the planet would be inviting a boycott\u201d if they gave Elsa a girlfriend\u2014so why sell fewer tickets to a guaranteed smash hit when you can sell more?\n\nAnd when Disney already caused an uproar among anti-LGBT evangelicals five years ago with Elsa\u2019s nonspecific, feel-good song lyrics about \u201clet[ting] it go\u201d and \u201cbreak[ing] through,\u201d why would they double down this time around when they are sure to be under scrutiny?\n\nThe parallel isn\u2019t perfect, of course, but I always think about the interracial couple in The Princess and the Frog whenever LGBT fans seem to think the moment for a queer Disney character has finally arrived. According to Gallup polling data, a majority of Americans have approved of marriage between black people and white people since 1997, and over 75 percent have approved since 2004, but Disney still waited until 2009, when support was over 80 percent, to tell the story of Tiana and her prince. That\u2019s the definition of playing it safe.\n\nSo, if we speculate that Disney would wait to include an LGBT main character in an animated film until they only risked angering fewer than 20 percent of American viewers, then we\u2019ve still got a ways to go yet. As of 2017, according to Gallup, only 64 percent of Americans now support same-sex marriage, up from 42 percent in 2004. If approval continues to climb at that exact same rate, it will hit the 80 percent mark in\u202617 years\u2014probably about the same time that Frozen 7: Olaf\u2019s Revenge comes out.", "images": ["https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/fb.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/email-icon.svg?d=342", "https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/thedailybeast/1741381130319.png", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/images/obsessed-header-logo-h-2.png?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/7L6PYMCE7RHEBIJZKR23DVTIJI.jpg?smart=true&auth=2558e4fc878237f3ad5bb1aa41ed598bebc770410fe3c21b06f961d190dd7689&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/G5424UOCPRBHRAR7RIIB2BVTUI.jpg?smart=true&auth=2059b6b69a525e43cb325cfe1ab78619ee5f17383dc15c8d992c26622972abd9&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/A63MWLYCCFHBPHOWMDSMB2AC34.jpg?smart=true&auth=e6e0d7b78502b822266b1e2ab946831e823f84ee61b3369b9a9446f43ee046eb&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/WX2YOPUHPVI53DVHKUXX4O2SBQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=f8207021613a3aeed4cdb2e132960660da68f4209e32257e8ed357b815072ca0&width=1200&height=630", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/google_play.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/twitter-icon.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/WX2YOPUHPVI53DVHKUXX4O2SBQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=f8207021613a3aeed4cdb2e132960660da68f4209e32257e8ed357b815072ca0&width=1600&height=900", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/social-logos/reddit.svg?d=342", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/CA3SBAC7NJGJJI5ZH4T2BOXSSY.jpg?smart=true&auth=febb80c37d6c8f85521f97ca93fe56543f7fa790476febc828f4e461ce8e5882&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/EBVD35EVNNDADMAVLRZ5PLP364.JPG?smart=true&auth=ab52ff6edfde082e8a27acd41efa239e37bad163bffae566036d859b6fd6c56c&width=1440&height=1080", "https://www.thedailybeast.com/pf/resources/svgs/badges/app_store.svg?d=342", "https://cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/thedailybeast/MDJ6R2IUGBI5NAJQX4JIYZQ23Q.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/WX2YOPUHPVI53DVHKUXX4O2SBQ.jpg?smart=true&auth=f8207021613a3aeed4cdb2e132960660da68f4209e32257e8ed357b815072ca0&width=1200&height=630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Allen", "Got A Tip", "Send It To The Daily Beast", "Catherine Bouris", "Leigh Kimmins", "Cameron Adams", "Harry Thompson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-elsa-really-getting-a-girlfriend-in-frozen-2-dream-on-disney-fans/", "title": "Is Elsa Really Getting a Girlfriend in \u2018Frozen 2?\u2019 Dream On, Disney Fans", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Walt Disney Studios has the weakest LGBT record among the major studios.
