Paramount Network released the a NSFW trailer for the adaptation of the 1988 cult comedy on Thursday, January 18, and the claws are really coming out.\n\nThe NSFW video provides the first glance at Shannen Doherty\u2019s return \u2013 and yes, she\u2019s still wearing the red bow. She\u2019s also carrying a gun! \u201cWhatever you do, make sure it matters,\u201d the actress says.\n\nRelated: \u201980s Stars: Then and Now While some of today's biggest A-listers got their start in the '80s, many of their famous contemporaries in the \"Me\" decade live quieter, more low-profile lives today. From Tom Cruise, who bravely donned those tighty whities in Risky Business, to the boys and girls of the Brat Pack, click through to see which stars got their big breaks in the 1980s \u2014 and see where they ended up!\n\nSeries creator Jason Micallef has kept very quiet about what role Doherty will be taking on in the dark reboot, but did confirm she\u2019ll be in three episodes. \u201cShe is in the very first scene of the very first episode. That\u2019s all I got for you,\u201d he told reporters at the 2018 Television Critics Association\u2019s Winter Press Tour on Monday, January 15.\n\nIn November 2016, Doherty shared the first photo from set, writing, \u201cJealous much?\u201d\n\nThe show will put a fresh spin on the high school classic, Micallef noted. \u201cIt\u2019s 2018, it\u2019s not 1988. No one\u2019s going to want to watch a girl for 10 episodes follow a guy around, murder people and then whine about it,\u201d he said. However, original film fans should keep a keen eye out. \u201cThis show is like a love letter to the original movie. There\u2019s so many little Easter eggs in each episode, even little things hidden in the set,\u201d he added.\n\nRelated: TV Shows Gone Too Soon These TV shows, including Firefly, Freaks and Geeks, and Happy Endings, were cancelled or ended before their time \u2014 see which dearly departed programs made the list\n\nVeronica Sawyer is still the lead and will be played by Grace Victoria Cox. Heather Chandler (played by Melanie Field) is the \u201cunconventional leader,\u201d Heather Duke (played by Brendan Scannell) is the No. 1 sidekick and Heather McNamara (played by Jasmine Mathews) is the nicest Heather but is harboring a dark secret. Selma Blair also appears in the new trailer as an entirely new character.\n\nScannell pointed out that the show will change out the \u201cthree beautiful white women\u201d from the film and plugging in something completely different: a plus-size leader, a black lesbian and a gay male. \u201c[In] our sort-of modern retelling we\u2019ve got \u2026 these communities that still face discrimination,\u201d Scannell said. \u201cBut in our show [they] are turning that on its head and using the internet and using the power of pure self-confidence to trash everybody around them.\u201d\n\nRelated: Best and Movie Remakes With 21 Jump Street hitting the big screen Friday, see which other classics have been revamped over the years\n\nThe series is set to be a 10-episode anthology, with each future season to be set at a different school.\n\nHeathers premieres on Paramount Network on Wednesday, March 7, at 10 p.m. ET.", "images":
