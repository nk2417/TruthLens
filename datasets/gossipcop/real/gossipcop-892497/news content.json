Back then, Lachey was happily married to Jessica Simpson, and would stop by TRL in support of both his music and his reality show with Simpson, Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica.\n\nExplore Nick Lachey See latest videos, charts and news\n\nWith Lachey happily married and Minnillo in a long-term relationship, the two remained super cordial whenever they\u2019d run into each other, whether it was on TRL or some other mutual engagement. \u201cIt was always about business and it was always nice to see him,\u201d Minnillo (now Vanessa Lachey) tells Billboard.\n\nBut right around the same time that Lachey\u2019s marriage ended in 2006, he recruited Minnillo for the video for the titular single from his sophomore solo effort, What\u2019s Left of Me \u2014 and with Minnillo also recently single, their typically cordial involvement began to feel a little more than just friendly. In fact, their chemistry was so undeniable, Minnillo couldn\u2019t even face Lachey when he came through TRL to promote the video that she starred in.\n\nAnyone who tuned in to TRL the day Lachey was on for \u201cWhat\u2019s Left Of Me\u201d may have noticed that Minnillo was nowhere to be found. But what viewers also may have noticed was that Lachey was clearly onto her, as he picked a girl from the crowd outside holding a sign reading \u201cMove Over Vanessa\u201d to come into the studio.\n\nAlthough Lachey and Minnillo \u2014 who married in July 2011 and now have three kids together \u2014 weren\u2019t face-to-face that day, it was a pivotal moment in their relationship that took things from friendly to romantic. In celebration of TRL\u2018s reboot premiering on MTV this week, Billboard chatted with both of the Lacheys to get the full rundown of that fateful day (with a guest appearance from LaLa Anthony, who filled in for Minnillo on that episode). Check out their recount below.\n\nNick: I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say TRL brought us together, but that was definitely part of our time together \u2014 me being a musician and her being on-air talent. I saw her multiple times throughout the years when she was on TRL.\n\nVanessa: It wasn\u2019t until, coincidentally, I broke up with my longtime boyfriend and he was getting divorced that we ended up reconnecting. He did a solo album and he asked me to do the video for \u201cWhat\u2019s Left of Me.\u201d And he\u2019ll joke, \u201cIn my grand marketing scheme I thought if I get the girl who is on TRL to do my video, she\u2019ll play it on the show.\u201d Little did he know I had no pull! My joke is I never got paid to do the video. And of course he\u2019s still paying to this day, if you ask him.\n\nBut the video, which was on TRL, was the beginning of our relationship. That\u2019s what made it no longer friends and it got romantic. To the point that if you go back and look at the video, when he came to premiere it, I was so nervous and so crushing him that I didn\u2019t show up for work that day. I called in sick.\n\nNick: [Laughs.] We\u2019d started kind of talking, and I got to the studio fully expecting to be interviewed by her. Probably a little psyched to think I\u2019d be interviewed by her \u2014 and instead it was Lala [Anthony]. Not that I have anything against Lala, but I was like, \u201cOh, where\u2019s Vanessa?\u201d And they were like, \u201cOh, she called in sick?\u201d And I was like, \u201cAh\u2026here we go.\u201d\n\nVanessa: We\u2019d gone from friends to [me] starting to feel something for him. So, like a child, I ran from it and called in sick. Lala was like, \u201cGirl, you in love. I\u2019ll fill in for you today but you better come back to work!\u201d\n\nAnthony: I remember that day like it was yesterday. We were so excited for her because she was in that video and she looked beautiful. I was off that day and they were like, \u201cShe\u2019s not coming in today. You need to come in.\u201d Come in for what? I\u2019m not in the video! They\u2019re like, \u201cShe\u2019s not feeling well.\u201d I\u2019d do anything for her. I knew she liked him.\n\nVanessa: [Nick] was actually offended. He went to the window to pick a fan to come up and this girl had a sign that said \u201cMove Over Vanessa, I\u2019m here.\u201d He said, \u201cBring her up!\u201d\n\nNick: I just wanted to be like, \u201cHow dare you call in sick the day I come on?\u201d So I decided to have a little fun with her, rub it in her nose a little bit \u2014 I knew she\u2019d be watching.\n\nVanessa: I told him later I didn\u2019t know what to do. I didn\u2019t know how to confront you. I didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\nNick: But she was like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you did that.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t come to work today!\u201d You never know how it\u2019s going to play out, but I thought I\u2019d at least get my shot in there.\n\nAdditional reporting from Mickey Rapkin.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Vanessa-Minnillo-Nick-Lachey-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Vanessa-Minnillo-Nick-Lachey-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=628&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Vanessa-Minnillo-Nick-Lachey-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Taylor Weatherby", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/nick-lachey-vanessa-minnillo-romance-trl-whats-left-of-me-video-7981924/", "title": "He Said, She Said: Nick & Vanessa Lachey Recount the Day \u2018TRL\u2019 Helped Turn Their Friendship Into Romance", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Although Lachey and Minnillo -- who married in July 2011 and now have three kids together -- weren't face-to-face that day, it was a pivotal moment in their relationship that took things from friendly to romantic.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Taylor Weatherby", "tags": "Vanessa Lachey", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "He Said, She Said: Nick & Vanessa Lachey Recount the Day \u2018TRL\u2019 Helped Turn Their Friendship Into Romance", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/nick-lachey-vanessa-minnillo-romance-trl-whats-left-of-me-video-7981924/", "description": "Although Lachey and Minnillo -- who married in July 2011 and now have three kids together -- weren't face-to-face that day, it was a pivotal moment in their relationship that took things from friendly to romantic.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Vanessa-Minnillo-Nick-Lachey-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Vanessa Minnillo, Nick Lachey"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-06T21:24:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-06T21:24:10+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Although Lachey and Minnillo -- who married in July 2011 and now have three kids together -- weren't face-to-face that day, it was a pivotal moment in their relationship that took things from friendly to romantic.", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "He Said, She Said: Nick & Vanessa Lachey Recount the Day \u2018TRL\u2019 Helped Turn Their Friendship Into Romance", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Vanessa-Minnillo-Nick-Lachey-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507325050.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
