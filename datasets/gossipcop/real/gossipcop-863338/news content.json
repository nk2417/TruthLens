The constant back-and-forths between the people who see the Iron Throne as their right, and the masterful manipulations they employ to get there, have made up some of the show\u2019s most shocking moments.\n\nThat\u2019s why when you look at the data to confirm who in Westeros and Essos has done the most backstabbing, it\u2019s easy to see who\u2019s holding the knife.\n\nVenngage, an infographics firm, compiled a list of every \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d betrayal in order to map out the manipulations and deaths among six seasons. When pointing them out, you can see all the people who were at the receiving end of the most betrayals and the ones that were at the throwing end.\n\nAccording to that data, Varys \u2014 Master of Whispers and known spider \u2014 has raked in the most with seven. This includes the complicated plan where he testified against Tyrion in Season 4, then helped Jaime Lannister to free Tyrion, only to get him to Daenerys in Meereen.\n\nConsidering he\u2019s been in the Lannister\u2019s employ and lives in King\u2019s Landing, it makes sense that most of his plans have been against the Lannisters. He was also partially responsible for selling Daenerys off to Khal Drogo in Season 1.\n\nAnother high roller in the betrayal department includes another non-surprise \u2014 Petyr Baelish, who comes in with six. If you remember all the way back to Season 1, his first major backstabbing was against Ned Stark (\u201cI did warn you not to trust me\u201d was only the beginning of the end).\n\nHonorable mentions include Tyrion, who has four, Ellaria, who has three and Cersei, who has six. The latter gets special consideration for manipulating almost everybody in King\u2019s Landing and killing them all off in a giant explosion at the end of Season 6.\n\nBetrayal is such an important aspect of living in Westeros that the only way to adapt is to learn the art. Both Sansa and Arya have low numbers on the list, but are working their way up. Arya spent most of Season 6 working on her skills, while Sansa finally got her freedom after the Battle of the Bastards.\n\nThe data also goes in the other direction, showing who was the butt of most schemes. The winner of that contest by a mile is Robb Stark, whose costly mistakes became the reasoning for one of the most brutal slaughters in the show\u2019s history.\n\nYou can check out the full infographic below.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-littlefinger.jpg?fit=990%2C557&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-littlefinger.jpg?fit=1280%2C720&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/5x4_082025_COVER_B.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/venngage-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2017/06/GOT_2017d.jpg?w=1200&quality=89&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-littlefinger.jpg?fit=1280%2C720&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carli Velocci", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid", "Border-Radius Box-Shadow Rgba", "Rgba"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/game-of-thrones-betrayals-data/", "title": "This \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 Infographic Shows You Who\u2019s Done the Most Backstabbing (Photo)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "This 'Game of Thrones' Infographic Shows You Who's Done the Most Backstabbing (Photo)", "description": "The results are not even remotely surprising", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/game-of-thrones-betrayals-data/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/game-of-thrones-littlefinger.jpg?fit=1280%2C720&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 1280, "height": 720, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-11T19:52:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-11T21:24:33+00:00"}, "author": "Carli Velocci", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@velocciraptor", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Carli Velocci", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "cersei-lannister, game-of-thrones, hbo, petyr-baelish, varys", "article-categories": "tv", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499802756.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
