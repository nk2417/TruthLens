Pumpkins.\n\nNBC will air the David S. Pumpkins Halloween Special at 11:30 p.m. ET on Saturday, October 28. The special will bring back the movie star and veteran SNL host as the bizarre character who \u2014 accompanied by a pair of skeletons played by Mikey Day and Bobby Moynihan \u2014 confused and eventually terrified a pair of guests on a haunted attraction.\n\nRecommended Videos\n\nAccording to NBC\u2019s announcement of the Halloween special, the animated tale will be set \u201cin a small suburban town on All Hallows\u2019 Eve,\u201d and feature a young boy and his sister who learn about the true meaning of Halloween from David Pumpkins and his skeleton sidekicks. In keeping with the theme of the original skit, the trio of weird Halloween characters teach the siblings about Halloween while \u201canswering none of their questions,\u201d according to NBC.\n\nAlong with Hanks returning to voice David Pumpkins, and Day and Moynihan voicing the skeletons, the special will also feature a character voiced by Emmy-winning Game of Thrones actor Peter Dinklage.\n\nThe original \u201cHaunted Elevator\u201d skit aired on October 22, 2016, and immediately became a viral video sensation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary how quickly the original SNL sketch caught on, and we\u2019re thrilled that Tom Hanks is back to keep the fun going,\u201d said George Cheeks, NBC Entertainment\u2019s President of Business Operations and Late Night Programming, in a statement accompanying the announcement.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s far from the first SNL skit to be expanded into a television of movie feature, the David S. Pumpkins character is somewhat unique for being a role played by one of the show\u2019s guest hosts instead of an SNL cast member. Previous SNL skits that were adapted into long-form features include Wayne\u2019s World and The Blues Brothers, and most recently, 2010\u2019s action comedy MacGruber. The most commercially successful feature to date was 1992\u2019s Wayne\u2019s World, which earned $121.6 million in U.S. theaters and $183 million worldwide.\n\nAnimation for the special will be provided by Bento Box Entertainment, with Day, Moynihan, and skit co-creator Streeter Seidell writing and producing the special.", "images": ["https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/david-s-pumpkins-halloween-special-tom-hanks/image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/david-s-pumpkins-halloween-special.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&p=1", "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Digital-Trends-Newsletter-Module-Update.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/david-s-pumpkins-halloween-special.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&p=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rick Marshall", "Published September"], "canonical_link": "https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/david-s-pumpkins-halloween-special-tom-hanks/", "title": "Tom Hanks will return as David S.
