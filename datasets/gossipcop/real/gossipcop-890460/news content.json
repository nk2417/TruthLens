Some of you may know that we have four children, and we just had twins about seven months ago,\" Stapleton said during a 14-minute version of the song \"Tennessee Whiskey.\"\n\n\"Now there's four for us, but we're gonna make it five,\" he sang.\n\nStapleton's announcement nearly \"blew the roof off of Madison Square Garden,\" a concert-goer said.\n\n\"The crowd was incredibly happy for them. It was probably the biggest reaction all night.\" Sean Roche, who captured the moment on film, said.\n\n\"Tennessee Whiskey\" was the last song Stapleton played in the main set, Roche said, to a packed arena.\n\n\"It's amazing. New York doesn't even have a country music station, and to fill up Madison Square Garden is pretty impressive,\" Roche said. Not typically a country fan, Roche saw Stapleton open for another act at a small New York venue a few years ago, and he said the musician made every jaw in the room drop.\n\nWhen she announced the twins last year, Morgane Stapleton wrote on Instagram: \"14 years, two babies, and two more on the way. Happy 10 year anniversary babe. You make my whole world go round.\"\n\nThe longtime couple perform together, and she joined her husband on stage Friday night when he made the announcement.\n\nChris Stapleton posted photos and video from the Madison Square Garden show later that night on Instagram but did not mention the pregnancy news in the post.\n\nReach Mariah Timms at mtimms@tennessean.com or 615-259-8344 and on Twitter @Mariah Timms.", "images": ["https://www.tennessean.com/gciaf/prod/p?a=pageview&p=PNAS-TEALIUM-TANGENT&m=web&k=f14ebdd6-0569-4c64-af73-99937bc06379&s=noscript", "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/2b3f1b08af7c3a6725c001d234f38348dd080819/c=0-0-3702-4937/local/-/media/2017/11/08/TennGroup/Nashville/636457817948501726-cma-2017252.JPG?width=300&height=401&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/presto/2022/03/03/PNAS/ed251faa-c779-4da9-b807-cc5a87d8b9d5-MT_headshot_samador.jpg?crop=523,523,x103,y202&width=48&height=48&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/c069a4f8d74431c4b3c7b954492bde9138e66d43/c=0-0-3702-2092/local/-/media/2017/11/08/TennGroup/Nashville/636457817948501726-cma-2017252.JPG?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/c069a4f8d74431c4b3c7b954492bde9138e66d43/c=0-0-3702-2092/local/-/media/2017/11/08/TennGroup/Nashville/636457817948501726-cma-2017252.JPG?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/11/04/chris-stapleton-morgane-pregnant-madison-square-garden-country-music/1884583002/", "title": "Chris Stapleton announces wife Morgane pregnant with couple's fifth child", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#0098FE", "og": {"title": "Chris Stapleton announces wife Morgane pregnant with couple's fifth child", "description": "Chris Stapleton made a special announcement during his Madison Square Garden set Friday night in New York City.", "url": "https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/11/04/chris-stapleton-morgane-pregnant-madison-square-garden-country-music/1884583002/", "site_name": "The Tennessean", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/c069a4f8d74431c4b3c7b954492bde9138e66d43/c=0-0-3702-2092/local/-/media/2017/11/08/TennGroup/Nashville/636457817948501726-cma-2017252.JPG?width=3200&height=1809&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "width": 3200, "height": 1809}, "type": "article"}, "article": {"author": "Mariah Timms", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "description": "Chris Stapleton made a special announcement during his Madison Square Garden set Friday night in New York City.", "fb": {"pages": 42128399297, "app_id": 121487414583460}, "ROBOTS": "NOODP, NOYDIR, max-image-preview:large", "google": "notranslate", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.tennessean.com/gcdn/-mm-/c069a4f8d74431c4b3c7b954492bde9138e66d43/c=0-0-3702-2092/local/-/media/2017/11/08/TennGroup/Nashville/636457817948501726-cma-2017252.JPG?width=1600&height=800&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "site": "@tennessean", "creator": "@tennessean", "title": "Chris Stapleton announces wife Morgane pregnant with couple's fifth child", "description": "Chris Stapleton made a special announcement during his Madison Square Garden set Friday night in New York City."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1541304000.0, "source": "https://www.tennessean.com", "summary": ""}
