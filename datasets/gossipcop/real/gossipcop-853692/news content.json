You are briefly napping on the other side of the room after being an amazing mum all night so you'll read this when you wake...\n\n\u201cSeeing these images reminds me of those amazing 9 months that you sacrificed your whole being to grow our little one. The kindness, the beauty and organic nature of these photos makes me so very proud.\n\n\u201cYou brought such fun and such power into our lives being pregnant but you literally brought the word sexy into pregnancy, we all see it. Thank you for being my partner in this life and thank you for inspiring not just me but all others who read, hear or see what your soul gives us. Love, your husband.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not crying\u2026 it\u2019s just been raining on my face.\n\nAfter Bodhi\u2019s birth, the couple decided to spend a full month alone \u2013 just the three of them.\n\nNikki told Fit Pregnancy in its September issue, \"We'll take the baby's first month for ourselves.\n\n\"After the baby arrives, we're doing one month of silence. Just the three of us, no visitors, and we're turning off our phones too, so there's no expectation for us to communicate.\n\n\u201cOtherwise, every five minutes it would be, 'How are you feeling? Can we have a picture?' You don't get those first 30 days back, and we want to be fully present.\"\n\nSo now those four weeks have passed\u2026 any chance of a photo?\n\nFollow Anna on Twitter.\n\n", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/6924d2f0-cbd8-4cc6-b220-5ae63e20eed5/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1707490537_72388.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/facebook.a5a3a69.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/year-of-the-teen-drama-691c99b2db40c.jpg?crop=0.505xw:1.00xh;0.248xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/youtube.ce3e1ae.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/john-torode-still-on-celebrity-masterchef-691c8bae8eebf.jpg?crop=0.670xw:1.00xh;0.0849xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/cosmopolitan/static/images/logos/logo.eca17dd.svg?primary=%2523000000", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/celebrity-masterchef-2025-691dc62006a95.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/squid-game-the-challenge-finale-691f27e13e37a.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1655513735.png?resize=980:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/katie-mcglyn-celebrity-masterchef-2025-contestant-691b574158c4e.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/line-of-duty-is-back-latest-release-date-details-and-cast-announced-for-22edge-of-your-seats-22-season-7-691caf98a22e7.jpg?crop=0.563xw:1.00xh;0.220xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/images/logos/ipso-regulated.4f346f9.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1655513735.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/alex-scott-and-jess-glynne-691deefcc6472.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.684xh;0,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/close.38e3324.svg", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/search.f1c199c.svg", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/x.3361b6d.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vogue-williams-and-tom-read-wilson-691df832d38c5.jpg?crop=0.716xw:1.00xh;0.115xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1655513735.png?crop=1.00xw:0.502xh;0,0.224xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tom-read-wilson-691755ed69d57.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.683xh;0,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/cosmopolitan/static/images/logos/logo.eca17dd.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/aitch-i-m-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-2025-69132140cb018.jpg?crop=0.809xw:1.00xh;0.0962xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=%2523ffffff&id=social-button-icon", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/en-gb/static/images/logos/network-logo.eae65ae.svg?primary=%2523ffffff", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/eddie-kadi-69133639dac3b.jpg?crop=0.809xw:1.00xh;0.0465xw,0&resize=360:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rebecca-mafs-uk-691f1586eeb67.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.795xh;0,0&resize=360:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/instagram.f282b14.svg?primary=currentColor&id=link-out-embed"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1655513735.png?crop=1.00xw:0.502xh;0,0.224xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a12046644/ian-somerhalder-nikki-reed-instagram-tribute-birth/", "title": "Ian Somerhalder posts loving tribute to wife Nikki Reed after birth of their first baby", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Ian Somerhalder's loving tribute to wife Nikki Reed after birth of their first baby", "description": "Ian Somerhalder has posted the sweetest, most loving tribute to his wife Nikki Reed on Instagram.
