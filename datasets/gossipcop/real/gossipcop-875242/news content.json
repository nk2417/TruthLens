See where your 'Hills' favorites, including Lauren Conrad, Heidi Montag, and Audrina Patridge ended up!\n\nThe Laguna Beach alum and Slack married at Calamigos Ranch in Malibu in October 2013. They announced her pregnancy in February, joining fellow MTV stars Whitney Port and Lauren Conrad, both of whom welcomed babies in July.\n\nIn fact, Wahler and Slack discovered that they were expecting the same day that his ex-girlfriend Conrad, 31, announced her pregnancy. \u201cThis is so funny \u2014 so we found out the morning of New Year\u2019s Day [that I was pregnant],\u201d Ashley exclusively told Us Weekly in February. \u201cThen I saw that Lauren was pregnant that same day, that she came out saying she was pregnant, and I was laughing, because I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, my gosh, that\u2019s so funny that it just happened all at the same time.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars Who Got Their Start on Reality TV The road to success in Hollywood is a little different for every would-be actor, but these days, reality TV is becoming a major launching pad for some of the industry's biggest stars. Before they were red-carpet regulars, NeNe Leakes, Jennifer Hudson, Julianne Hough and Lucy Hale were among those who broke through as reality stars\n\nWaller added, \u201cLiterally, we texted somebody saying, \u2018Oh, my God, we\u2019re pregnant!\u2019 and they sent us the thing about Lauren \u2026 I was like, \u2018So awkward.'\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and
