People's Choice Awards (airing Sunday, November 11 at 9/8c).\n\nAll told, Grey's Anatomy and Shadowhunters lead the field with five nominations a piece. Fellow scripted series 13 Reasons Why and Riverdale are close behind (with four nominations each), followed by The Big Bang Theory and This Is Us (with three nominations each).\n\nOf Grey's Anatomy's five nominations, two are for leading lady Ellen Pompeo (who is nominated for both Drama TV Star and Female TV Star), while another two are for the series itself (which is nominated for both TV Show and the more specific Drama TV Show category).\n\nIf we may take a moment to nitpick, the Revival Show category doesn't pay any mind to the actual definition of \"revival.\" Nominees include reboots One Day at a Time and Dynasty, which are in no way continuations of the original series on which they're based, and therefore, not. reboots. (Sigh.)\n\nOnline voting for the PCAs remains open through Friday, October 19 at 11:59 pm ET.
