{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal_Gadot", "text": "Israeli actress (born 1985)\n\nGal Gadot (pronounced [\u02c8\u0261al \u0261a\u02c8dot];[1] born 30 April 1985) is an Israeli actress. She gained recognition for portraying Wonder Woman in the DC Extended Universe films (2016\u20132023). In 2018, Gadot was named one of Time's 100 most influential people and ranked by Forbes as the tenth-highest-paid actress, later rising to third in 2020. She became the first Israeli actor to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2025.\n\nGadot grew up in Rosh HaAyin and first gained attention locally after winning Miss Israel 2004, followed by two years of service in the Israel Defense Forces as a combat trainer. During this time, she participated in a Maxim photo shoot that boosted her public profile, resulting in her beginning to model and endorse various brands. Shortly after, she made her television debut in the Israeli drama Bubot in 2008, followed by her film debut in a supporting role as Gisele Yashar in Fast & Furious (2009), reprising it in multiple sequels (2011\u20132023).\n\nGadot first portrayed Wonder Woman in Batman v Superman (2016). The success of the film led to her starring in Wonder Woman (2017), which became a major box office hit. She also reprised the role in Justice League (2017) and Wonder Woman 1984 (2020), the latter of which she also co-produced. Since then, she has starred in Red Notice (2021), Death on the Nile (2022), and Heart of Stone (2023), which she co-produced. In 2025 she portrayed the Evil Queen in Snow White and Gemma Donati in In the Hand of Dante.\n\nBeyond acting, Gadot and her husband have co-founded a film production company, launched a food brand, and invested in Israeli startups. She is widely celebrated in Israel as a national icon and ambassador. However, her strong support for the Israeli military and her advocacy regarding a hostage crisis have sparked both praise and criticism.\n\nBackground\n\nGal Gadot was born on 30 April 1985[2] in Petah Tikva,[note 1] where she initially lived at Stampfer street.[9] She was born to Jewish parents of Ashkenazi descent;[7] her mother's roots are Czech and Polish, while her father's are Austrian, Russian, and German.[10] Her parents, Michael, an engineer, and Irit, a physical education teacher,[11][12] hebraized their surname from \"Greenstein\" to \"Gadot\" before her birth.[13] In Hebrew, her first name means \"wave\", and her surname translates to \"riverbanks\".[6] She has a younger sister, Dana.[14]\n\nHer father is a sixth-generation Sabra,[15] and one of his ancestors was the first chemist at Shaare Zedek Hospital in Jerusalem,[16] while her mother is a first-generation Sabra and the daughter of Holocaust survivors.[14][5] Her maternal grandfather,[5] Abraham Weiss,[17] was born as Adolf Weiss,[18] in the village of Munk\u00e1cs,[19] Czechoslovakia in 1928. At 13, when Nazi Germany invaded, his father died in the army and he, his mother, and his brother were sent to Auschwitz, where the latter two perished in the gas chamber. Gadot's maternal grandmother, however, managed to escape Europe before World War II.[20][15][17] Abraham immigrated alone to Jaffa, where he built a life. He later served in the Golani Brigade; in his later years, Abraham joined Israel Defense Forces (IDF) expeditions to share his first-hand Holocaust testimony.[21]\n\nIn 1993, at the age of eight, Gadot and her family moved to the Givat Tal neighborhood of Rosh HaAyin, where she grew up,[22][8][15] in what she described as a \"very Jewish, Israeli family environment\".[14] As a child, she struggled with a weak voice and attended speech therapy, where she learned proper breathing techniques.[23] Encouraged by her mother to be active from a young age, Gadot took up swimming at four and later played tennis.[15] She joined the local volleyball and basketball teams,[24] soccer-team cheerleader,[19] and trained in ballet, hip-hop, and jazz for 12 years; at one point, Gadot considered a career as a choreographer.[14]\n\nAt 11, she visited Holocaust memorial sites in Poland to learn about Auschwitz and Majdanek. Reflecting on the experience, she recalled: \"I, an entitled child, felt the suffering the Muselmann experienced back then.\"[25] At 12, she was invited to enter the Girl of the Year [he] (Hebrew: \u05e0\u05e2\u05e8\u05ea \u05d4\u05e9\u05e0\u05d4\u200e) competition but declined, initially dismissed modeling as a career, but later realized it is a fun job that makes great money and offers exciting experiences.[24]\n\nAlthough Gadot's native language is Hebrew, she started taking English lessons in third grade; she became fluent when she decided she wanted to watch Seinfeld and Friends.[26] She later attended Begin High School, where she majored in biology.[25] After graduating, she had a few months before beginning her mandatory two-year service in the IDF. During this time, she received modeling offers but instead chose to work at Burger King, saying, \"I was like, posing for money? Ugh, it's not for me.\" Meanwhile, her mother and a friend submitted an application on her behalf for the Miss Israel pageant.[15] Before enlisting, she also worked as a caregiver for eight-month-old twins.[25]\n\nCareer\n\n2004\u20132009: Miss Israel, IDF service and early work\n\n\"It wasn't my love for fashion or glamour that led me there. My enlistment [in the army] had been postponed by six months, and all my friends were already in uniform. My mother suggested I try out [Miss Israel], so I went through the selection process, met wonderful girls, and thought, 'Why not? It will be fun, and I'll get one last trip abroad before the army.' I figured it would make for a good story to tell my future grandchildren.\" \u2014Gadot reflecting on her decision to enter the beauty pageant, via a 2008 interview with Ynet [ 24 ]\n\nIn 2004, the 54th Miss Israel beauty pageant was held at the Haifa Congress Center,[27] where an 18-year-old Gal Gadot participated with little expectation of winning. However, the 5'10\" Gadot[25] was crowned Miss Israel by Sivan Klein, and Yona Yahav,[28] and received a Citro\u00ebn C3 supermini car.[29] Following her win, Gadot represented Israel in the Miss Universe 2004 pageant in Ecuador but admitted she intentionally \"rebelled\" to avoid winning, arriving late to events and refusing to wear an evening gown.[30] During an interview with Ynet, and before giving up her pageant title, Gadot highlighted the value of military service, viewing it as both a duty and a chance for personal growth.[31] In 2005, a week after passing on the crown,[32] Gadot, at 19,[33] was conscripted into the Israel Defense Forces. After excelling in a three-month boot camp,[34] she went on to serve as a combat trainer, teaching soldiers gymnastics and calisthenics.[35] Reporting daily at 5 a.m., she led soldiers through a form of boot camp.[15] Gadot became so passionate about the techniques she learned that she eventually trained sergeants and high-ranking commanders.[36] Gadot also trained in Krav Maga,[37] gaining proficiency in handling weapons and preparing for combat.[36] She completed her mandatory two-year service, of which only 20 days were in uniform.[38] Reflecting on her military experience in a 2016 interview with Fashion, Gadot said, \"It was demanding because you give up your freedom for two years, but there is something special in giving back to your community.\"[36]\n\nIn 2007, while still serving, 21-year-old Gadot appeared in Maxim's \"Women of the Israel Defense Forces\" photo shoot,[39] which was later featured on the cover of the New York Post.[40] The shoot was part of a campaign by Israel's consulate in New York, Maxim, and the Ministry of Tourism to \"promote Israel, attract young American men, and reshape its public image\".[39] The campaign faced criticism, particularly from Knesset members, over the portrayal of female soldiers in bikinis.[41] Reflecting on the criticism, Gadot stated in a 2013 Forward interview that she's \"a model, not a doctor.\"[42] After the issue was released in July 2007,[42] the shoot significantly boosted Gadot's public profile;[43][44] as a result, she landed an international campaign for \"Prada Ellis\" perfume.[31]\n\nThat same year,[45] she began pursuing law and international studies[46] at IDC Herzliya (now Reichman University).[31] She attributed this decision to being \"so deep\", and because she \"loved\" Ally McBeal.[15] After her first year, a casting director from London contacted Gadot's agent after seeing her modeling card on the agency's wall, which led her to audition for the role of Camille Montes in the James Bond film Quantum of Solace.[34][47] In a 2017 interview with W Magazine, Gadot said she initially felt \"too serious and smart to be an actress\" due to her studies and was uncomfortable speaking English.[46] Her agent urged her to go \"out of respect,\" and the casting director supported her through several callbacks.[47] Although she lost the role to Olga Kurylenko,[34] Gadot found the experience \"interesting\" and told her agents to let her know if any other opportunities came up that might be a better fit for her.[47] She dropped out of IDC Herzliya,[48][49] and, two months later, made her acting debut in the Israeli drama Bubot.[47] She recalled that on the first day of classes, she received a call informing her that she had landed the lead role of Miriam.[24] She later performed in Festigal Underwater, an annual Israeli musical show for kids during Hanukkah, where she performed as a mermaid, acting, singing, and dancing.[50][51]\n\nThree months after her audition for Quantum of Solace, the same casting director recommended Gadot to Universal Studios and contacted her about a role in Fast & Furious.[47][52] She was asked to \"urgently\" send a filmed audition to Los Angeles, which was well received. As a result, the studio flew Gadot and her agent, the CEO of the Look Agency, to LA for a personal meeting with Vin Diesel, who would decide if she got the role.[52] Gadot was ultimately chosen over six other actresses for the supporting role of Gisele Yashar in the fourth film of the franchise.[53][54]\n\nReflecting on the audition process, Gadot shared that she worked closely with Israeli coach Orit Shar, preparing thoroughly and building a backstory that impressed director Justin Lin.[24] Filming took about a month.[24] After filming wrapped in 2008, Gadot signed with Endeavor, becoming the only Israeli represented by the agency.[24] Later that year, she signed with ICM agency and One management.[55] After Fast & Furious was released in 2009, Gadot reflected on her success saying, \"I can't believe this happened to me..I have more luck than intelligence.\"[56] The role is considered her big break, earning rave reviews and cementing her status as a \"Hollywood mainstay.\"[57] That same year, she made a brief appearance in the TV series Entourage[58] in the episode titled \"Amongst Friends\", portraying Lisa, a date of the main character, Vincent Chase.[59] Gadot later described her experience on set as unpleasant, saying she left due to \"inappropriate behavior.\"[60] She later appeared on the American teen drama, The Beautiful Life: TBL.[61]\n\n2010\u20132016: Breakthrough as Wonder Woman\n\nIn 2010, Gadot had small roles in the action-adventure comedy Knight and Day and the action comedy Date Night,[62] which took her five days to film her scenes with Mark Wahlberg.[38] In 2011, Gadot reprised her role as Gisele in Fast Five.[63] Gadot explained that giving Gisele a Mossad background allowed for character development across multiple films. She believes director Lin valued her Israeli military experience and aimed to use her weapons knowledge in the role.[42] Later that year, she appeared in the second season of the Israeli series Asfur, playing Kiki, a coffee shop owner in Amsterdam.[64] In 2012, she starred the Israeli drama, Kathmandu.[65] Sources in the industry estimate that Gadot earned over NIS3,000 (approximately US$800) per day of filming.[66] In 2013, she returned to the Fast & Furious franchise, reprising her character in Fast & Furious 6,[63] where she performed some of her own stunt work in the film.[67] In May 2013, Gadot revealed in an interview with Reshet that she was offered a role in a Disney film but turned it down due to the requirement of shaving her head. It has been speculated that the role may have been for the MCU's Nebula.[68]\n\nIn November 2013, Variety reported that Gadot, along with other actresses, had tested for the role of Wonder Woman.[69] In December 2013, Gadot was confirmed for the role in the untitled Batman v Superman movie alongside Henry Cavill and Ben Affleck, directed by Zack Snyder.[70][71] The contract for her portrayal of Wonder Woman was managed by her then-agent, ADD agency, which represented Gadot both in Israel and internationally.[72][73] She left the agency in 2019 on good terms.[74] Reflecting on her audition for the role in a 2016 Variety interview, Gadot described the process as \"super intensive, nerve-racking, a long roller coaster\". While in LA, Warner Bros. invited her to audition for an undisclosed role with Snyder. Later, her agent informed her that she would be testing with Affleck. Afterward, she eventually scored the role.[47]\n\nBefore landing the role, Gadot shared her frustration with the constant rejection she faced while auditioning in Los Angeles. In a Sunday Today interview with Willie Geist, she said, \"There's so much no,\" explaining that after a few Fast & Furious films, she considered quitting acting, feeling discouraged. She also explained that acting was not something she had dreamed of as a child. Instead, the opportunity came to her, saying, \"I started to become more curious about it, and then I fell in love with the profession.\"[75] In a similar reflection during a The Hollywood Reporter interview, Gadot said she struggled to gain traction, saying, \"I had so many almosts for big, great things, but I was never big enough of a name.\" She recalled being the runner-up for the role of Imperator Furiosa, which ultimately went to Charlize Theron in Mad Max: Fury Road (2015), explaining, \"It was always me and the big name.\"[76][77]\n\nIn June 2014, she signed a three-picture deal with Warner Bros. to appear as Wonder Woman, reportedly earning $300,000 per film.[78]\n\nIn July 2014, Gadot's portrayal of Wonder Woman was unveiled at Comic-Con during the Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice panel. Some critics argued Gadot's Israeli background and slim frame made her unfit to play the part. Gadot dismissed the backlash.[36] Despite prior criticism of her physique, she stated that she had trained to build muscle for the role, moving beyond her previous Fast & Furious image.[79] To prepare, she took lessons in swordsmanship, Kung Fu, kickboxing, capoeira and Brazilian jiu-jitsu,[80] gaining 17 pounds of muscle. She also explained that she \"trained six hours a day for six months\u2014two hours of gym work, two hours of fight choreography, and up to two hours of horseback riding. It was much more intense than the army.\"[81] That same year, Gadot landed her first Israeli film role in the comedy Kicking Out Shoshana, playing lead character Mirit Ben-Harush.[82] Later that year, she was offered the lead role in the Hollywood remake of Ben-Hur (2016) but had to decline due to scheduling conflicts with Batman v Superman.[83]\n\nPrior to her debut as Wonder Woman, Gadot revealed she had previously been offered the role of Faora-Ul in Man of Steel (2013). Gadot turned it down due to her pregnancy; this led to Antje Traue being cast for the role instead.[84][85][86] In 2016, Gadot officially debuted as Wonder Woman in the superhero film Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Gadot's performance as the superhero, the character's first film appearance, was singled out by The Guardian as one of the film's best parts.[87] Her portrayal of Wonder Woman quickly became a defining role in her career, with critics praising her for bringing strength, grace, and a refreshing depth to the character. Critics particularly noted how she brought a strong sense of empowerment and integrity to the role, setting a new standard for female superheroes in mainstream cinema.[88]\n\nShe then had a small role in John Hillcoat's crime-thriller Triple 9, where she starred along with Kate Winslet and Aaron Paul.[89] Later that year, she co-starred in the action crime thriller film Criminal, as the wife of Ryan Reynolds' character, alongside Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, and Tommy Lee Jones.[90] She described the film as the most challenging project she had done to date.[36] Her final film of the year was the action comedy Keeping Up with the Joneses, in which she played a secret agent, alongside Zach Galifianakis, Jon Hamm, and Isla Fisher.[91] Critic Alex Welch wrote on IGN about Gadot's performance: \"the script unfortunately banks mostly on her looks and deadly skills as a spy for her jokes, but Gadot manages to make it work.\"[92]\n\n2017\u20132020: Wonder Woman solo films and production ventures\n\nIn 2017, Gadot starred in a solo film for her character, Wonder Woman, which was paid $300,000. This figure sparked some controversy, as it was significantly lower than the salaries commanded by many male action stars in Hollywood.[93] However, the film received a positive response from critics, with some calling it the best installment in the DC Extended Universe. Praise was directed at Patty Jenkins's direction, the chemistry between Gadot and Chris Pine, the musical score, and the thrilling action sequences.[94][95] Due to her former service in the IDF, the film has been banned in Lebanon, Kuwait, and Jordan.[96][97] She then reprised the role in the ensemble film Justice League, which was released in November 2017, and was her third DC Extended Universe installment.[98][99][100] During the film's production under director Joss Whedon, she alleged that Whedon verbally abused her and \"threatened\" her career. In response, she stated in an interview that she took the matter to the heads of Warner Bros., who \"took care of it\".[101]\n\nThat same year, Gadot was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[102] Gadot then voiced the character Shank, who was modeled after her, in the Walt Disney Animation Studios film, Ralph Breaks the Internet (2018).[103][104] The film's co-director, Phil Johnston, praised Gadot's performance.[104] The she appeared in the music video for Maroon 5's song \"Girls Like You\" featuring Cardi B.[105] In January 2020, National Geographic announced Impact with Gal Gadot. The six-part documentary series, executive produced by Gadot and her husband, highlights young women overcoming poverty, violence, and discrimination to create positive change in their communities,[106][107] premiered in April 2021 across National Geographic's digital and social platforms.[108]\n\nGadot returned as Wonder Woman in Wonder Woman 1984 (2020), for which she reportedly earned $10 million.[93] The sequel to her 2017 solo film was released on 25 December 2020, both in theaters and on the HBO Max streaming platform due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[109] The film received praise for Gadot's performance and the visual effects; however, it garnered mixed reviews from critics, with some finding the plot overly complex and less impactful than the first film.[110][111]\n\n2021\u2013present: Streaming projects\n\nIn November 2021, Gadot starred alongside Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds in the Netflix action comedy film Red Notice, written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber.[112] The Guardian, in its review, opined that Gadot was \"sleepwalking through the motions\" and was \"adept only when fighting\".[113] The film, however became Netflix's most-watched film ever, as reported by Bloomberg. The film has over 328 million hours streamed in its first three weeks. This equates to 164 million accounts watching it in full, making it the most-watched new movie of 2021.[114]\n\nThe following year, she co-starred with Kenneth Branagh, Tom Bateman, and Annette Bening in the 2022 mystery film Death on the Nile, which was also directed by Branagh.[115] Los Angeles Times' chief film critic Justin Chang deemed her \"underwhelming\" in the film,[116] while The Week's Jesse Hassenger defends Gadot's performance addressing the widespread criticism she received for her portrayal of Linnet Doyle, particularly for a meme-worthy line delivery.[117] The film was banned in Tunisia following protests over Gadot's Israeli military service and her support for Israel's 2014 Gaza offensive.[118] This decision, followed by bans in Kuwait and Lebanon, reflects longstanding support for the Palestinian cause.[119]\n\nIn 2023, Gadot made uncredited cameo appearances as Wonder Woman in Shazam! Fury of the Gods and The Flash.[120][121][122] She also returned to the Fast & Furious franchise with a cameo appearance in Fast X.[123] Later that year, she was offered the role of Barbie in Barbie, but she was unavailable.[124][125] Later that year, she played the lead role of a double agent in Netflix's action film Heart of Stone.[126] This film is Gadot and her husband's first project developed and produced through their company, Pilot Wave, which they began developing in 2018. She called it an \"extremely empowering and educational experience\".[127] The film however, received mostly negative reviews, with Owen Gleiberman stating: \"Gadot is game, but there's a slightly downbeat earnestness about her that doesn't mesh with the reflexive quippiness of the dialogue.\"[128] Despite negative reception, the film emerged as Netflix's second-most-watched film in the second half of 2023, with nearly 110 million views.[129]\n\nGadot next starred as the Evil Queen in a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.[130] In an interview with GQ, she said Disney needed to confirm she could sing, so she spent a month preparing before auditioning and landing the role.[131] She also had her own personal dialect coach for the role.[132] In August 2024, calls from pro-Palestinian activists to boycott Disney's Snow White remake emerged due to Gadot's support for Israel.[133][134][135] In March 2025, it was reported that Disney assigned bodyguards to Gadot after she received death threats linked to co-star Rachel Zegler's \"Free Palestine\" post during Snow White's promotional campaign.[136] Gadot's performance in the film was polarizing; some felt it showcased her potential as a villain, while others argued she lacked the charisma and menace needed for the role. Her rendition of the song \"All Is Fair\" drew particular criticism for its awkward delivery and lack of vocal strength, which undercut the intended impact of the character.[137][138] In response to the criticism she received for the film, Gadot stated in an interview that audiences primarily saw her as an Israeli rather than as an actress. She further added that the film\u2019s lack of success was due to the \"pressure on celebrities to speak out against Israel.\"[139]\n\nThat same year, Gadot appears in Julian Schnabel\u2019s film In the Hand of Dante as Gemma Donati, alongside Oscar Isaac as Nick Tosches / Dante Alighieri and other lead actors.[140] Based on Tosches\u2019 novel, the film moves between 14th- and 21st-century Italy and follows the discovery of a handwritten manuscript of Dante\u2019s The Divine Comedy that travels from the Vatican to the New York underworld.[141] The film first premiered on September 3, 2025, at the Venice Film Festival.[142] Gadot\u2019s appearance in the film sparked calls for a boycott, in response, Schnabel stated at that he chose the actors for their merits and that they did \"an extraordinary job,\" adding that he sees no reason to boycott artists for their pro-Israel stances.[143] When asked why he cast Gadot he responded: \"at the time [of casting], I spoke to her on the phone and we did face-offs. From that conversation, I knew she could do the role. In this film, she really reminds me of Ingrid Bergman. She was so warm and embracing toward Isaac. And if you\u2019re wondering why this woman is immediately ready to be with this man, it\u2019s because they were married 700 years ago and she recognized him. He doesn\u2019t know who he is, but when he looks at her, he thinks, \u2018Okay, there\u2019s something familiar.\"[144]\n\nOther endeavors\n\nEndorsements and modeling\n\nBefore enlisting in the Israeli army, she worked briefly as a model in Milan. She then returned to Israel and continued modeling while serving in the military.[145] In 2007, following the Maxim \"Women of the Israel Defense Forces\" photoshoot, Gadot's public image gained significant attention,[43] leading her to promote various products, appear in numerous advertisements, and feature in several magazines. She first landed an international campaign for Prada Ellis perfume.[31] She then became a spokesmodel for the Israeli clothing brand Castro,[146] a role she held for over 11 seasons, reportedly earning about $100,000 per season.[43][146] In 2010, Gadot walked the runway for Castro's collection and continued modeling for the brand regularly through 2015.[147]\n\nIn 2013, Castro CEO Gabi Rotter noted that Gadot was not widely known when she was chosen but was the \"perfect fit to represent Israeli beauty\". He cited her background as both an IDF soldier and a beauty pageant contestant as key factors in her selection, following in the footsteps of Israeli models like Yael Abecassis and Sendi Bar.[43] In 2013, Gadot signed a two-year deal with skincare brand Carline. According to Ofer Yaar from the advertising agency Bruckner Neta Yaar, Gadot was selected as the spokesmodel because she embodies the brand's values, being \"local and international, she exudes simplicity and accessibility, and she is your best friend, even when she is Wonder Woman.\"[43] In 2015 she became the face of Gucci Bamboo.[148] In 2018, Reebok announced an endorsement deal with Gadot, reported to be worth $10 million (NIS 34 million).[149] She also became a brand ambassador for Huawei, which led to controversy after she tweeted a promotional video using an Apple device. Gadot explained that the mistake was made by a member of her publicity team, who posted the video from the wrong phone.[150]\n\nGadot behind the scenes of Revlon's \"Live Boldly\" campaign\n\nIn 2018, Revlon named Gadot its global ambassador for its \"Live Boldly\" campaign. The brand executives praised Gadot as a symbol of \"strength, beauty, and empowerment,\"[151][152][153] with Fabian Garcia, Revlon's president & CEO, emphasized that Gadot represent \"the beauty, determination and attitude that reflect what it is for women to live boldly in today's world\".[154] However, her role drew criticism, notably from Muslim blogger Amani Al-Khatahtbeh, who rejected a Revlon award because of Gadot's support for the IDF.[155]\n\nIn 2019, Gadot starred in commercials alongside Hot's popular stars, promoting the brand's \"Israeli pride\" campaign. Hot CEO Tal Granot-Goldstein described her as the perfect fit, embodying the essence of \"Israeliness\" for the new campaign.[156] In 2021, she became the brand ambassador for Smartwater, a division of Coca-Cola.[157] In April 2023, Gadot became the new ambassador of Tiffany & Co., and was honored to cut the ribbon at the brand's new Fifth Avenue store in New York.[158]\n\nProduction ventures\n\nGadot\u2019s husband and his brother owned a boutique hotel in Neve Tzedek, Tel Aviv, called the Varsano Hotel, which she helped run.[159][160] In 2015, it was sold to Russian oligarch and politician Roman Abramovich for INS 100 million (approximately $26 million).[160] In October 2019, Gadot formed a film and television production company, Pilot Wave, with her husband Jaron \"Yaron\" Varsano.[161][162] Reflecting on the decision Gadot stated in a 2023 interview with L'Or\u00e9al, \"the whole idea of starting the production company with my husband was to be in control of my own destiny. I'm not the type of person who likes to sit and wait for the next offer.\"[163] Since then, she has shared teasers for different projects\u2014some got mixed reactions, but none have been released.[164] In November 2021, Gadot and her husband launched Goodles, a mac and cheese brand co-founded with \"experienced partners\" like former Kraft brand executive Paul Earle, with the goal of offering a healthier alternative to traditional boxed mac and cheese.[165] In 2022, the couple invested in Safe School, an Israeli startup founded by Doron Herman, which provides educational content focused on social issues for children and teenagers. This investment is part of their ongoing support for Israeli startups, following a previous investment in K Health.[166]\n\nReception\n\nMedia reception\n\nGadot faced early criticism for her slim physique during her pageant years in 2004, with some speculating about eating disorders, claims she dismissed as rooted in unrealistic beauty standards.[167][168] Ynet noted Gadot was once seen as a \"shelf product,\" struggling to break into local fashion. Photographer Alon Shefransky called her transformation from a \"baby-faced look\" to a more defined presence a \"wow moment,\" comparing it to discovering \"the next Natalie Portman.\"[43] By 2012, Gadot ranked second on Forbes Israel's list of top-earning models, with earnings of NIS 1.3 million (approximately US$350,000), and in 2013, her earnings rose to NIS2.4 million (approximately US$650,000), driven largely by brand endorsements and her role in Fast & Furious.[169][170][171] In 2015, Forbes Israel ranked her 49th on their list of \"The Most Powerful Women in Israel\" and 38th on their list of \"Influential Women\".[172][173]\n\nAhead of Wonder Woman's 2017 release, Gadot received 95% positive online comments, with Taykey analytics ranking her as the most beloved Israeli globally.[174] Taykey's CEO, Amit Avner, noted that Gadot had already been the most talked-about personality during Super Bowl commercials, one of which she appeared in earlier that year. However, the release of Wonder Woman would elevated her popularity to new heights.[174] That same year Forbes Israel ranked 35th on their list of \"Influential Women\",[175] and ranked 53rd on Forbes \"30 Under 30 list\".[176] Additionally, she topped FHM's \"100 Sexiest Women in the World\" list.[177] That same year, she became the third highest-grossing actress of 2017, earning $1.4 billion worldwide.[178]\n\nIn her January 2018, article for The Forward, Jenny Singer critiques how Gadot is portrayed in the media, particularly on the cover of Vanity Fair. Despite Gadot's \"success as an actress, activist, and athlete\", Singer argues that she is often reduced to a sex object, with her talents overshadowed by her physical appearance. Singer suggests that Gadot's background, including her modeling past and accent, may contribute to the media's focus on her looks rather than her accomplishments.[179] That year, Time magazine named Gadot one of the 100 most influential people in the world,[180] and Forbes ranked her as the tenth highest-paid actress in the world, with annual earnings of $10 million.[181] In 2020, Forbes ranked Gadot as the third highest-paid actress in the world, with annual earnings of $31.5 million.[182] In 2022, Variety reported that Gadot earned $5 million for her role in Death on the Nile. She was the highest-paid star in the movie.[183] In June 2023, it was announced that Gadot would become the first Israeli actor to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[184][185] This was met with criticism,[186][187] and by March 18, 2025, she officially received it. The ceremony was disrupted by both pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protesters, with signs reading \"Snow White supports genocide\" and \"standing with Israel\".[188][189][190]\n\nCultural reception\n\nIn her honor, the Azrieli Center in Tel Aviv was illuminated on 1 June 2017, ahead of the Israeli premiere of Wonder Woman. The towers displayed the message: \"We are proud of you, Gal Gadot, our Wonder Woman.\"[191]\n\nIn Tel Aviv, a Wonder Woman poster featuring Gal Gadot with the Hebrew phrase \"We love you!\" in the upper left corner. [ 192 ]\n\nAs reported by CBC News, Gadot's portrayal of Wonder Woman has made her \"the world's most famous Israeli and the country's most high-profile ambassador\". Gadot has been compared to Bar Refaeli, who faced backlash for not serving in the military. Gadot is admired for her military service, which has endeared her to Israelis. Her image as a \"good Israeli\" and her inspiring presence in Wonder Woman have made her a source of \"national Israeli pride\", with fans cheering and even crying at her appearances.[192]\n\nIsabel Feinstein of The Jerusalem Post praised Gadot as a powerful example of \"soft power\" for Israel, highlighting how her rise to global fame offers the \"Jewish state\" a unique opportunity for positive international exposure. Feinstein highlighted that Gadot's Google search results (20.7 million) surpass those of Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu (16.1 million), emphasizing her global influence.[193] She also noted that Gadot's appearances on Western talk shows like The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon and The Ellen DeGeneres Show have helped humanize the stereotype of the \"brutal Israeli soldier\", making her relatable to a worldwide audience. Feinstein went on to describe Gadot as \"a living contradiction\", claiming that \"the association of an Israeli actress with a progressive agenda helps those who unfairly condemn all citizens of a nation for the actions of their government see that Israelis are complex and open-minded humans with a wide range of opinions\".[193] In a 2019 article by The Australian Jewish News, it is highlighted that Gadot is often seen as a more effective ambassador for Israel than its diplomats, given her global fame. Ari Ingel of the Creative Community for Peace believes her interactions with prominent Hollywood figures can positively influence Israel's image. However, Shayna Weiss of Brandeis University views this as a \"soft power\" issue\u2014using culture to sway opinions\u2014and questions whether such influence has measurable or lasting effects, saying, \"I don't think Gal Gadot harms Israel, but do I think Gal Gadot helps Israel much? Not so sure.\"[194]\n\nThe release of the film sparked a debate about Gadot's Jewish identity and her portrayal as a woman of color.[195][196] Some argued that as an Israeli Jew, Gadot should be seen as not white, or at least not straightforwardly so, through a lens of racial complexity, in the context that Hollywood has historically limited representation of diverse identities.[197][198][199] Others, including some Jews of color, argued that Gadot is white, and thus Wonder Woman was a breakthrough for white women but lacked representation for women of color.[200][201][202] In contrast, others viewed Gadot's role as a positive step toward broader representation, especially for Jewish women, Israeli heritage, distinct accent, and strength as a heroic figure.[195] Tamar Hermann reflected on Gadot's portrayal, noting that Jewish women are often underrepresented or stereotyped in Hollywood. For many, Gadot's role offered a rare and empowering representation of Jewish women, highlighting her Israeli heritage, distinct accent, and strength as a heroic figure.[203] Arielle Iniko Newton argued that Black women's support for the film ignored Gadot's ties to the IDF and her stance on Palestinian oppression.[204] Salam Al-Mahadin objected not to her whiteness, but to \"her status as an enthusiastic Israeli soldier and citizen and the film's valorization of US imperial militarism\".[196]\n\nDuring his visit to Los Angeles for the General Assembly of the Jewish Federations, President Reuven Rivlin was invited by Gadot to the premiere of Justice League, a film in which she stars. Rivlin embraced Gadot, expressing his pride in her as a \"true ambassador\" of Israel, \"who has managed to place us [Israeli] at the pinnacles of global filmmaking with grace, values, and an Israeli smile.\"[206]\n\nIn June 2018, amid an Arab boycott of Gadot, a cinema in the northern Israeli town of Nazareth Illit was named \"Gal Cinema\" in her honor. The two-screen cinema opened with the film Shelter by Israeli director Eran Riklis. The spokeswoman Orna Yosef stated the decision aimed to inspire young people, highlighting Gadot as a symbol of success and the fulfillment of dreams.[207] On November 7, 2022, Gadot was honored at the Israeli Culture & Arts (ICA) Awards by the America-Israel Cultural Foundation (AICF). The award recognized her significant contributions to film, alongside other Israeli artists.[208]\n\nIn May 2023, Gadot received an award for \"extraordinary achievements\" at an event celebrating Israel's 75th Independence Day in Los Angeles, organized by the Israeli-American Community (IAC) and the Israeli Consulate. In her speech, Gadot expressed pride in her Israeli heritage and emphasized the importance of strengthening ties between Israelis and Americans.[209] In January 2025 Dudi Caspi, Israel's representative to the Golden Globes Association, spoke with Iris Cole on 103FM radio about the ceremony. He praised Gadot, calling her \"a good ambassador for Israel\". Caspi noted that although Gadot did not wear a hostages pin at the event, she remains an important figure for Israel in Hollywood.[210] In March 2025, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) awarded Gadot a \"Certificate of Appreciation\" for her strong stance against anti-Semitism and hatred, and her unwavering support for Israel and Jewish communities worldwide.[211]\n\nIn July 2025, at the Jerusalem Film Festival, Gadot received two awards: one from the Festival for her contributions to international cinema and her success over two decades of work, and another from Hadassah for \"her unwavering and courageous support of Israel and for using her global platform to promote truth and justice on behalf of Israel.\"[212] Festival director Roni Mahadev-Levin credited Gadot as \"an actress who turned the Israeli dream into a global reality,\" adding that she is \"a true movie star who turns films into blockbusters, a leading figure in world cinema who opened doors for Israeli creators around the globe and raised international awareness of Israeli culture.\"[212] Hadassah president Carol Ann Schwartz and chairwoman Dalia Itzik stated that Gadot was an obvious choice for the award, which had previously been presented to actress Gwyneth Paltrow, with Schwartz said, \"Choosing Gadot was natural \u2014 she is a trailblazing woman who serves as an ambassador of Israel and the Jewish people wherever she goes.\"[212]\n\nAdvocacy\n\nGadot identifies as a feminist and promotes women's empowerment.[213] In July 2016, Gadot joined a campaign by Israeli female master's students in communications to rebrand Israel by highlighting its strong women. Titled \"Israel Creates Wonder Women,\" it spotlighted real \"Israeli heroines\" in different fields to promote female empowerment. Gadot supported the initiative after the students reached out to her.[214]\n\nLeft to right: Patty Jenkins, Gadot, and Lynda Carter in 2017.\n\nLater In 2016, Gadot, fellow Wonder Woman actress Lynda Carter, DC Entertainment President Diane Nelson, director Patty Jenkins and U.N. Under-Secretary-General Cristina Gallach appeared at the United Nations on 21 October 2016, the 75th anniversary of the first appearance of Wonder Woman, to mark the character's designation by the United Nations as its \"Honorary Ambassador for the Empowerment of Women and Girls\".[215][216] The gesture was intended to raise awareness of UN Sustainable Development Goal No. 5, which seeks to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls by 2030.[215][216][217] The decision was met with protests from UN staff members who stated in their petition to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that the character is \"not culturally encompassing or sensitive\" and served to objectify women. As a result, the character was stripped of the designation, and the project ended on 16 December.[217]\n\nIn a January 2018, interview with Women's Wear Daily, she highlighted Hollywood's ongoing cultural shift towards gender equality, calling it necessary and overdue.[213] Later, Gadot took part in the #WeRemember campaign, organized by the World Jewish Congress to preserve Holocaust remembrance. CEO Robert Singer praised her involvement, highlighting the vital role of influencers in combating antisemitism.[218]\n\nThat same year, she attended the Golden Globes, where she joined fellow actors in wearing black to support the Time's Up movement. Reflecting on the event, Gadot shared, \"It was incredibly impactful, and just being part of it felt so powerful and inspiring.\"[219] In July 2018, Gadot surprised children at Inova Children's Hospital in Annandale, Virginia, by visiting them dressed as Wonder Woman.[220]\n\nIn May 2019, Gadot supported a \"Reach Out Association\" trip for 25 ill children in LA.[221] In November 2020, Gadot was criticized by Donald Trump supporters and some Israelis after congratulating Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on their election win. Critics called her a populist and a \"Hollywood liberal who has forgotten what is good for her country.\"[222] In October 2022, Gadot faced mixed reactions after posting support for the Jewish community in response to Kanye West's \"antisemitic remarks\". She shared an Instagram photo wearing a Star of David necklace with the caption \"proud.\" While some praised her for speaking out, others accused her of using the moment for publicity and criticized her past silence on Israel-related issues.[223]\n\nIn April 2023, Gadot hosted a Holocaust Remembrance event at her Hollywood home, welcoming survivors and Hollywood guests as part of the \"Zikaron BaSalon\" tradition. She said, \"I don't know about God, but I believe in people, in the power of one's decision to do good.\"[224][225] In May 2023, she visited children from the \"Lend a Hand\" organization during a visit to Universal Studios in Los Angeles.[226] During 2025 California wildfires, Gadot voiced her support for those affected by the fires in Los Angeles.[227]\n\nSupport for Israel\n\nGadot has been described as outspoken in her support for Israel.[212] During the 2014 Gaza War, Gadot posted on Facebook a picture of herself and her daughter praying in front of Shabbat candles praying for Israeli citizens and soldiers, and condemned Hamas as \"cowards\" \"hiding behind women and children\".[228] The post sparked both support and criticism due to differing views on the conflict.[229]\n\nIn 2019, Gadot clashed with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the status of Israel's Arab minority after Netanyahu's remark that Israel is a \"nation-state\" for Jews only. Responding to actress Rotem Sela\u2019s call for equality for all citizens, Gadot supported her, saying it's about \u201cpeace, equality, and tolerance.\u201d Her comments sparked mixed reactions, some praised while others criticized her for not taking a firmer political stance.[230]\n\nDuring the 2021 Israel\u2013Palestine crisis, Gadot initially stayed silent which led to criticism from Israeli and Jewish media.[231] Gadot later called for peace in a statement that sparked widespread backlash. While expressing support for Israel, she referred to Palestinians as \"neighbors\" rather than naming them directly, which many saw as downplaying their suffering.[232][233][234] Yair Netanyahu, son of the Israeli prime minister, criticized her neutrality, arguing that, \"as one of Israel's best-known\" she should have taken a stronger stance. He compared her to Bella and Gigi Hadid, who are vocal in their pro-Palestinian support, saying Gadot acted \"as if she was from Switzerland\" instead of strongly supporting Israel.[235] Israeli nationalists also expressed disappointment, believing she should have used her global influence to defend Israel more strongly.[235]\n\nIn 2022, following several attacks, including the Bnei Brak and Tel Aviv shooting attacks, Gadot faced criticism from Israeli media and fans for staying silent.[236][237][238] She was compared to the Hadid sisters, with critics urging her to speak, however, she remained silent in response.[239][240] In May of that year, Gadot expressed her support for Noa Kirel, the Israeli representative in the Eurovision semi-final, calling her a \"unicorn\".[241]\n\nIn October 2023, during the Gaza war, Gadot posted a story on her Instagram stating, \"Killing innocent Palestinians is horrific\", alongside condemning the killing of Israelis. This led to criticism from some in Israel.[242] The post drew backlash in Israel, with some accusing her of equating both sides.[243] Journalist Ofira Asayag criticized her as out of touch and questioned her loyalty to Israel, comparing her to celebrities like Dwayne Johnson and Gigi Hadid, who showed more balanced support for both sides.[242] In response, Gadot later emphasized, \"Killing innocent Israelis is horrific,\" and deleted the mention of Palestinians following further criticism.[244][245]\n\nLater that month, Gadot, along with over 700 Hollywood professionals, signed an open letter condemning the Palestinian militant group Hamas, demanding the release of hostages, and expressing support for Israel.[246] In November, Gadot organized a screening of Bearing Witness, a film showing Hamas violence, though she did not attend.[247] The screening drew criticism from Jewish Voice for Peace, which called the film \"propaganda\" and accused Gadot and director Guy Nattiv of overlooking the Palestinian perspective and promoting a pro-war agenda.[248]\n\nIn May 2024, Gadot publicly supported Eden Golan, Israel's Eurovision representative, encouraging her followers to vote for Golan. As a result, Gadot lost one million Instagram followers. Despite the backlash, Gadot continued to share posts praising Golan and urging votes throughout the competition.[249] In September 2024, Gadot joined Israeli president Isaac Herzog in launching the \"Voice of the People\" initiative, aimed at fostering global Jewish unity amidst rising antisemitism and the \"ongoing hostage crisis\".[250][251]\n\nWhen I look back 15 years, when I was starting out, being Israeli was something that people admired and were excited about\u2014Israeli women, their strength, and all that. I'm not saying it's no longer the case, but now it's complicated. The conversation has changed. It's different. And I find myself, time and again, having to engage in very complex and often uncomfortable discussions with people who have opinions about what's happening, trying to give them the full picture of what's really going on.\n\n\u2014 Gadot reflecting on shifting views of Israel.[252]\n\nIn January 2025, Gadot participated in Noa Tishby's \"#BringOnTheLight\" campaign, celebrating Jewish resilience and joy during Hanukkah. The campaign featured other celebrities who lit the menorah on different nights.[253]\n\nLater that month, Gadot faced criticism for attending the 2025 Golden Globes without a yellow ribbon pin, a symbol of solidarity with hostages held by Hamas. Reports suggested she was prohibited from wearing it, but Gadot clarified she was not, explaining she chose to wear a yellow ring instead and used social media to raise awareness.[254] Despite her efforts, some criticized her for hypocrisy and silence, while others defended her.[255][256] Since then, she has been described as an outspoken advocate on social media and elsewhere for the hostages and their families.[257]\n\nIn February 2025, in an interview with Harper's Bazaar Spain, Gadot voiced support for a diplomatic solution to the Gaza\u2013Israel conflict, stressing her anti-war stance and belief in love over hate, saying \"War is a defeat for everyone. Hate is horrible. It is toxic for the outside world and for the hater.\"[258] In another interview with Variety, Gadot addressed backlash over her support for Israel, saying she was \"shocked by the hate\" and surprised \"by how the media is not fair many times,\" which motivated her to speak out. She emphasized her focus on humanity and hostages, and described herself as \"an indigenous person of Israel\" due to being an eighth generation Israeli.[259]\n\nWhen Pro-Palestine activists protested on the set of the film The Runner while Gadot was filming, Gadot and the production company brought a case against them based on a little-used trade union law.[260] [261]\n\nIn November 2025, it was announced that Gal Gadot was to be the 2026 Genesis Prize winner as recognition for her \u201cher advocacy for hostages, support of Israel and empathy for all innocent people affected by the war.\"[262] Gadot then announced that she would use the $1 million prize to help Israelis heal, rebuild, and recover.[263]\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 2020, Gadot purchased a penthouse in a gated community in Malibu, from former Miss Universe Bui Simon. The property is reportedly worth no less than $5 million.[264]\n\nAlthough Gadot has stated that she does not believe in God[225] and is not a \"religiously observant\" person,[265] she performs the Modeh Ani prayer,[266] and visited a synagogue to find solace in the Jewish community after the October 7 attacks.[265]\n\nRelationships and family\n\nIn 2006, Gadot was briefly linked to Israeli swimmer Eithan Urbach.[267] That same year, Gadot met her future husband, Jaron \"Yaron\" Varsano,[note 2] a real estate developer from Amsterdam who grew up in a Jewish family in the Netherlands,[30][271] in 2006 while she was still serving in the Israeli Army. The couple connected at a \"chakra/yoga retreat type of party\" in the Israeli desert.[272]\n\nIn 2008, during a weekend off from filming Fast & Furious 4, the couple went to Napa Valley,[24] where Varsano proposed to Gadot.[273] Later that year, on September 28,[274] they married at the David Intercontinental Hotel in Israel.[275] They reside in the Neve Tzedek neighborhood of Tel Aviv,[6] and have four daughters, Alma born November 5, 2011,[276] Maya born March 20, 2017, Daniella born June 29, 2021,[277][63][278] and Ori, born February 2, 2024.[279]\n\nHealth\n\nIn a 2023 interview with L'Officiel, Gadot talked about her struggles with impostor syndrome, often doubting how her work would be received.[280] In February 2024, during her eighth month of pregnancy with her fourth daughter, Ori, Gadot was diagnosed with cerebral venous thrombosis,[281] a rare type of stroke that accounts for less than 3% of all strokes.[282] She was rushed to the hospital, where she underwent emergency surgery within hours.[281] A year after, Gadot told Harper's Bazaar that the near-death experience made her more grateful and present in her life, reminding herself daily to slow down and go at her own pace.[258] She also went public with the experience to help raise awareness.[283]\n\nInfluences\n\nGadot has expressed admiration for Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, particularly for her courage, individuality, and confidence in embracing her identity. She appreciates how Cruz \"stands up for herself and has something to say\u2014she has her own spice, which I love. She is very courageous and also has an accent, but she just goes with it.\"[36] She also recognizes Yafa Yarkoni as her \"Israeli cultural hero\", referring to her as \"the singer of wars\".[25] Additionally, when asked which historical event she would like to witness, Gadot shared that she would have chosen the rally after which Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated, as it symbolized \"the extreme rejection of democracy\".[25]\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nKey \u2020 Denotes film or TV productions that have not yet been released\n\nTelevision\n\nMusic videos\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nSee also\n\nNotes", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/12/Gal_Gadot_SDCC_2014.jpg/250px-Gal_Gadot_SDCC_2014.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/Gal_Gadot_for_Revlon.png/250px-Gal_Gadot_for_Revlon.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Wonder_Woman_premiere_2.jpg/250px-Wonder_Woman_premiere_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/32/Wonder_Woman%27_film_premiere_%282017%29.jpg/250px-Wonder_Woman%27_film_premiere_%282017%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8d/Gal_Gadot_for_Revlon_5.jpg/250px-Gal_Gadot_for_Revlon_5.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Gal_Gadot_signature.svg/150px-Gal_Gadot_signature.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Gal_Gadot_for_Revlon.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Reuven_Rivlin%27s_visit_to_Los_Angeles%2C_November_2017_%288466%29.jpg/250px-Reuven_Rivlin%27s_visit_to_Los_Angeles%2C_November_2017_%288466%29.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Wonder_Woman_feat._Gal_Gadot_advertisement_in_Tel_Aviv%2C_June_2017.jpg/250px-Wonder_Woman_feat._Gal_Gadot_advertisement_in_Tel_Aviv%2C_June_2017.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/40px-Commons-logo.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Gal_Gadot_for_Revlon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal_Gadot", "title": "Gal Gadot", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Gal_Gadot_for_Revlon.png", "width": 900, "height": 1200}, "title": "Gal Gadot - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
