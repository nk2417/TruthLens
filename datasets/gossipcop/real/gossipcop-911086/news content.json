'She feels great.'\n\nGetty Images\n\nIn 2016, the 'Bad Liar' singer cancelled 34 remaining dates on her Revival world tour to seek treatment at a Tennessee facility to help her with anxiety, panic attacks and depression.\n\nPicking up the award for favourite female pop/rock artist at the AMAs that year, the singer-turned-actress revealed: 'I was absolutely broken inside.\n\n'I'm not trying to get validation nor do I need it anymore. All I can say is that from the bottom of my heart I'm so grateful to be able to share what I love every single day with the people that I love.'\n\nThe news of Gomez's recent treatment comes a day after the rumoured couple were spotted attending a church service and hockey match together in Los Angeles.\n\nBackgrid\n\n'They were very happy to see everyone there and were giving lot of hugs and saying hello as they entered,' an eyewitness told E!
