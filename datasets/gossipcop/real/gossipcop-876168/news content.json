MTV VMAs: Demi Lovato stuns in a VERY daring gown while Katy Perry and Heidi show off their incredible cleavage at the VMAs\n\nTHE MTV VMAs never shy from the outrageous and the glamorous and that\u2019s just what pop\u2019s finest brought tonight as they strutted in front of the cameras in LA.\n\nSinger Demi Lovato freed her nipples in a daring see-through lace top which she teamed with sequinned harem pants and black high heels.\n\nThe singer, 25, smouldered into the camera lens and meant business with her smoky eye makeup, nude lips and cascading brunette locks which she wore in loose waves.\n\nHost Katy Perry, 32, showed of her famous cleavage in white sculpted gown by St\u00e9phane Rolland.\n\nThe sunning number plunged down to her midriff and had a dramatic cape detail on the right shoulder.\n\nKaty accessorised with huge hoop earrings while her gold eye makeup as at a futuristic look to it.\n\nHeidi Klum, 44, may not walk the Victoria\u2019s Secret catwalk anymore but she showed off her model credentials in a sheer gold dress.\n\nAnd while there were intricate lace and jewel details on the gown all eyes were on the German model\u2019s killer cleavage.\n\nShe wore her blonde hair in a centre parting and kept it simple and straight, while she went for her usual smoky eye makeup.\n\nMel B let her dress do the talking quite literally, and appeared to send out a message to estranged husband Stephan Belafonte in a bright sequin dress.\n\nLarge letters said: \u201cYOU WILL NEVER OWN ME\u201d, while the back of it had an eye across her derriere.\n\nQuirky New Zealander Lorde shunned her usual gothic look and instead opted for a ball gown fit for a princess.\n\nThe floor-length lilac Monique Lhuillier dress had a strapless bodice and feather skirt which she teamed with simple black heels.\n\nThe singer wore her hair in a wavy half up \u2018do and kept her makeup minimal and natural.\n\nEd Sheeran may be up for Artist of the Year but that didn\u2019t mean he bothered putting on a pair of shoes.\n\nIn garb that would have him refused entries for most clubs, the 26-year-old Brit pop powerhouse wore a pair of trainer, with some casual blue trousers, blue T-shirt and jacket.\n\nThankfully his date for the evening Jennie Pegouskie added some glam to the pairing.\n\nThe stunning model and dancer who stars in his Shape of You video was a vision in white wearing a matching boob tube, trousers, with a cape draped over her shoulders, and scarped her dark locks into a chic topknot.\n\nCalvin Harris showcased some new facial hair tonight and arrived with a bushy ginger beard.\n\nThe dad-like beard wasn\u2019t the only part of his style revamp, the 34-year-old also opted for a purple shirt with peacock feathers and a pair of grey slacks.\n\nThe outfit led one Twitter user to ask: \u201cWhy\u2019s Calvin Harris look like he just set up a detective agency in Williamsburg?\u201d\n\nParis Jackson, 19, managed to balance chic and edgy as she hit the blue carpet in a sheer tulle dress embroidered with flowers and mythical creatures.\n\nUnderneath she wore a Dior bra and kickers set and finished the look with some gold strappy heels.\n\nNicki Minaj took it back to Pink Friday in bubble-gum pink spandex.\n\nThe 34-year-old singer showed off her incredible curves in the daring and slightly uncomfortable looking number which she accessorised with diamonds, and wore her hair half pink, half blonde, down past her knees.\n\nVanessa Hudgens embraced the apparent sheer theme of the night in a stunning red Yanina Couture dress.\n\nShe added volume to her choppy brunette bob and had subtle red eye makeup to match her gown.\n\nSinger Bebe Rexha showed off her curves in sheer dress with silver detail, which she appeared to go underwear free in.\n\nShe teamed it with chunky silver heels and went jewellery-free as she let the intricate dress design and bold makeup speak for itself.\n\nFormer X Factor winner James Arthur continues his rise back to the top, and walked the blue carpet in a military style jacket.\n\nPink decided to make the awards a family affair and a matching one at that.\n\nJoined by husband Corey Hart and daughter Willow Sage, the family beamed as they all donned three-piece suits.\n\nWhile Farrah Abraham and daughter Sophia, eight, went for a matching intergalactic look.\n\nAmber Rose looked unrecognisable as she shunned her usual bleach blonde crop and wore a slick brunette wig.\n\nShe arrived with rapper 21 Savage and the pair looked at one another adoringly as they posed for cameras.\n\nAlways one to make a huge style statement, Kesha wore a huge tulle dress, which matched her light pink hair.\n\nThe singer made a confident return to the spotlight after a tough year and looked happy and healthy in front of the cameras.\n\nFall Out Boy turned up on the red carpet with two men in a llama suits, because why not?\n\nAnd 30 Seconds to Mars\u2019 Jared Leto didn\u2019t care about clashing when he wore a red, green and blue sequined cape over a pink floral shirt.\n\nThe MTV VMAs is an annual event that honours the performers and creatives behind the best music videos of the past year and are
