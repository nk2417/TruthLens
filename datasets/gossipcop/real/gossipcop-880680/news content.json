Club, The Atlantic, Complex, Flavorwire, NPR, the fridge to get more seltzer.\n\nTo conclude his opening monologue at the 2017 Emmys, host Stephen Colbert took a moment to express some hope that this year\u2019s ceremony would draw a record-breaking audience \u2014 and then, to preemptively confirm it, invited none other than Sean Spicer to the stage.\n\nAs the audience gasped, Spicer wheeled out a podium and bellowed, \u201cThis will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period, both in person and around the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow,\u201d Colbert grinned, \u201cthis really soothes my fragile ego.\u201d\n\nThe bit, of course, was a not-so-sly reference to Spicer\u2019s very first day at work as Donald Trump\u2019s White House press secretary, in which he angrily declared to the press that Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd was the \u201clargest audience to witness an inauguration, period, both in person and around the world.\u201d\n\nThe bit was also completely unnecessary.\n\nColbert has spent the entirety of Trump\u2019s time in office railing against the president\u2019s hypocrisy, his exclusionary policies, and his affinity for telling lies whenever it\u2019s convenient. Every night that The Late Show has been on the air has been a night that Colbert has passionately slammed Trump and his staff alike for using their power to spread falsehoods and fear.\n\nThat\u2019s why seeing Colbert close out his monologue by sharing a chuckle with Spicer wasn\u2019t just jarring \u2014 it was incredibly disappointing.\n\nWith this toothless punchline, Colbert and the Emmys cast a jolly sheen over Spicer\u2019s tenure as press secretary, which began with that ridiculous lie about Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd size and continued with him berating the press for asking after the truth while evading it with all his might. It went against everything Colbert purports to do on his fiercely pointed Late Show, and retroactively sucked the air out of any biting Trump jokes he tried to make earlier in the opening monologue.", "images": ["https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-2155209999.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.669458870833%2C0%2C66.661082258335%2C100&w=2400", "https://www.google-analytics.com/g/collect?v=2&tid=G-C3QZPB4GVE&cid=555&en=noscript_page_view", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/the-true-meaning-of-friendsgiving.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=21.875%2C0%2C56.25%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/3_Vox_FuturePerfect25_LandingPage.gif?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9268419/848583468.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C44.302689180738&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AlexAbad-Santos_Vox.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9267319/489356138.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.766666666667%2C0%2C66.466666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-2155209999.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0.0041883062489489%2C0%2C99.991623387502%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AlexAbad-Santos_Vox.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-590696434.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/3_Vox_FuturePerfect25_LandingPage.gif?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-590696434.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9268419/848583468.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C66.454033771107&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9268701/848630160.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C5.0157444894287%2C100%2C89.968511021143&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9268701/848630160.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C14.672050646148%2C100%2C70.655898707704&w=1200", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/author_profile_images/11181/Photo_on_11-5-15_at_12.21_PM.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=96", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-2217689678.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.650390625%2C0%2C66.69921875%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9269247/848685914.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C2.4488825487399%2C100%2C95.10223490252&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/the-true-meaning-of-friendsgiving.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-2217689678.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.024402147388969%2C100%2C99.951195705222&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9269247/848685914.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=14.95%2C0%2C70.1%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9267319/489356138.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0.14999999999999%2C0%2C99.7%2C100&w=2400"], "top_img": "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9268701/848630160.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C14.672050646148%2C100%2C70.655898707704&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caroline Framke"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/17/16324198/emmys-2017-sean-spicer-video-colbert", "title": "Stephen Colbert welcoming Sean Spicer to the Emmys stage was a disappointment and a failure", "meta_data": {"bingbot": "nocache", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@voxdotcom", "url": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/17/16324198/emmys-2017-sean-spicer-video-colbert", "title": "Stephen Colbert welcoming Sean Spicer to the Emmys stage was a disappointment and a failure", "description": "The host derailed his own Trump jokes by joking around with Spicer.", "image": {"identifier": "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9268701/848630160.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C14.672050646148%2C100%2C70.655898707704&w=1200", "alt": "69th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards -
