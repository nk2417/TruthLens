She\u2019s such a lovely person I\u2019ve got nothing but love for her.\u201d\n\nThe British-born stand-up, who looked trendy in a printed blouse, went on to give his take about her latest job as judge on American Idol.\n\nHe continued: \u201cI don\u2019t know much about American Idol or things like that.\n\n\u201cI certainly think that she\u2019s probably a very good judge, so I certainly wouldn\u2019t comment on how much she\u2019s earning in the negative. I wish her all the best in all of her endeavours.\u201d\n\nKaty and Russell\u2019s relationship was immediately thrust into the spotlight in the run-up to their nuptials in 2010.\n\nReferring to the high-profile nature of their love, Russell added it was \u201cdifficult\u201d to tell what exactly was going on behind closed doors.\n\nMeanwhile, Russell is now a dad-of-one and married his wife Laura Gallacher this year.\n\nKaty has again found love with a British hunk and rekindled her love with Hollywood star Orlando Bloom.\n\nAnd it seems there really is no love lost between the pair.\n\nLast month, Russell said he wanted to re-build bridges with the platinum-haired beauty and told Grazia magazine: \u201cI\u2019m willing and open for reconciliation, any kind.\n\n\u201cBecause if we can\u2019t overcome our relatively trivial personal disputes in this world, what hope is there for us?\u201d\n\nDuring their whirlwind romance Katy, now 32, and Russell got matching tattoos that read \u2018Go with the flow\u2019 in Sanskrit and Russell has now revealed he has no intention of removing it.\n\nHe told the magazine: \u201cOf course I\u2019m going to keep it.\u201d\n\nKaty previously told Vogue magazine that she hadn\u2019t heard from her ex since he called it quits on their marriage.\n\nShe said: \u201cHe\u2019s a very smart man, a magical man and I was in love with him when I married him.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say I haven\u2019t heard from him since he texted me saying he was divorcing me December 31, 2011.\u201d\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220.\n\nWe pay for videos too.
