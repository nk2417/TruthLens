This felt more special.\n\n\u201cYou get married with the hope that you\u2019ll be together; when we renewed our vows, we said them not with just hope, but with a reassurance. Along with hope, there is also faith, love and bringing all the family together.\u201d\n\nRod, 72, said: \u201cPenny is my whole world. Love means many things to many people but to me it\u2019s wanting to share everything with the one you love and I love Penny now more than ever, if that is at all possible.\u201d\n\nLoose Women airs weekdays from 12.30pm on ITV\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict000273960627-e1495717986307.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C92px%2C1702px%2C1134px&resize=1920%2C1080", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/promo323005608.jpg?strip=all&w=960", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/TOB-Roses-v3_COMP-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JW_20_11_MANI_HEARTACHE_COMP.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/crop-37387356.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict000273960627-e1495717986307.jpg?strip=all&w=624", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/newspress-collage-wi7zeasod-1763662341978.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&1763662499&w=300&h=192&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/promo323005608.jpg?quality=90&strip=all", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rod-2.png?strip=all&w=960"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nintchdbpict000273960627-e1495717986307.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C92px%2C1702px%2C1134px&resize=1920%2C1080", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3910731/penny-lancaster-rod-stewart-vow-renewal-pictures-donate-grenfell-tower/", "title": "Rod Stewart and Penny Lancaster donate the proceeds from their wedding vow renewal pictures to the Grenfell Tower fire fund", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
