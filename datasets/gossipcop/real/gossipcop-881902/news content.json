The biggest blessing has been finding the love of my life and the ONE he has promised me,\u201d Lutz wrote at the time. \u201cIt\u2019s truly mind blowing to surrender to Him and see the blessings he has in store. Over a year ago, in a season of being single, I wrote a letter to God with all the qualities I truly wanted in my future wife. I stayed strong, I pressed in, I fixed some things I didn\u2019t know I needed to fix and after a period of prayer, patience, and perseverance, He brought her into my life in the most beautiful of ways. I now know what true love looks like!\u201d\n\nRelated: Love Story Beginnings: How Celeb Couples First Met Star-crossed lovers!
