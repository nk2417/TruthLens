The question remains unanswered, but maybe it will be addressed on the upcoming season of Don\u2019t Be Tardy.\n\nWe will have to wait and see what is shown when it comes to that horrible incident, but Kim has other dog-related drama. A \u201cfan\u201d reported her to animal control after she posted a photo of her dogs in cages.\n\nAccording to an article from Page Six, Kim explained the situation on Snpachat, \u201cApparently somebody thought it would be really cute to call the animal control center on my dogs today and say they were not being taken care of. I am utterly f\u2013king disgusted and appalled by the person who did this. I will no longer be sharing any part of my dogs and their life on my social media any longer.\u201d\n\nAnother day, another \u201cfan\u201d upset with Kim Zolciak\u2018s social media content. At least it\u2019s giving her a break from people bashing her cosmetic procedures.\n\nSince Kim was called out, she decided to call out one of her haters by posting a screen shot that the person posted in a Bravo fans Facebook group. Kim wrote, \u201cWell here is one of the jealous idiots!! Her account needs to be reported please help!! Wait til you see my next post! #ItsRescuesSweetheart #BoredMuch #NeedsAJob.\u201d This Kim hater included Kim\u2019s photo from her (now-deleted) Snap and she even included Kim\u2019s home address. How on earth did she know what Kim\u2019s home address is? Clearly she\u2019s been tracking their moves for a while.\n\nKim posted another screen shot and wrote, \u201cAnother gem!! She needs to be reported as well!! These people are sick\u201d\n\nKim\u2019s longtime chef and honorary family member Tracey Bloom stood up for her boss in a lengthy Instagram post. Part of Tracey\u2019s caption included, \u201cToday was especially upsetting because a stranger, a lurker, a hater, a judger, and perhaps even a \u2018fan\u2019 thought they should call animal services on my family because they felt that by viewing a post on snapchat that their animals were being mistreated. Animal services was not there long after seeing the impeccable conditions that the dogs were in.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Kim Zolciak Gives An Update On Her Son After Hospitalization For Dog Bite\n\nTELL US \u2013 DID YOU SEE KIM\u2019S SNAP OF HER DOGS?
