Everyone at Drai\u2019s wishes Lil Wayne a speedy recovery during this time.\u201d\n\nWayne was reportedly found unconscious at his Chicago hotel room Sunday after suffering a seizure. He was transported to the city\u2019s Northwestern Memorial hospital, where he had another minor seizure, Reuters reports.\n\nDespite efforts to get the rapper discharged in time for the Las Vegas show, doctors recommended that the rapper stay hospitalized for a few days, especially considering the multiple occurrences of Wayne suffering a seizure mid-flight.\n\nIn June 2016, Wayne\u2019s private jet made an emergency landing in Omaha, Nebraska after the rapper had a seizure during a Milwaukee-to-California flight. The rapper spent at least one night at an Omaha hospital during that ordeal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m prone to seizures,\u201d Wayne said in 2012, months after the rapper suffered a seizure aboard another private jet flight, which also forced an emergency landing and a Texas hospitalization. \u201cThis isn\u2019t my first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh seizure. I\u2019ve had a bunch of seizures, y\u2019all just never hear about them.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-839510740-73b3b28a-69ba-4e26-b822-40ec81036425.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-839510740-73b3b28a-69ba-4e26-b822-40ec81036425.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Kreps", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lil-wayne-hospitalized-with-multiple-seizures-cancels-las-vegas-show-118851/", "title": "Lil Wayne Hospitalized With Multiple Seizures, Cancels Las Vegas Show", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Lil Wayne canceled his Sunday night concert at a Las Vegas nightclub after suffering multiple seizures in Chicago earlier in the day.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Daniel Kreps", "tags": "Hip-Hop, Lil Wayne", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Lil Wayne Hospitalized With Multiple Seizures, Cancels Las Vegas Show", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/lil-wayne-hospitalized-with-multiple-seizures-cancels-las-vegas-show-118851/", "description": "Lil Wayne canceled his Sunday night concert at a Las Vegas nightclub after suffering multiple seizures in Chicago earlier in the day.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-839510740-73b3b28a-69ba-4e26-b822-40ec81036425.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "alt": "d"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-04T14:47:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T15:24:15+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lil Wayne canceled his Sunday night concert at a Las Vegas nightclub after suffering multiple seizures in Chicago earlier in the day.", "site": "@RollingStone", "creator": "@danielkreps", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lil Wayne Hospitalized With Multiple Seizures, Cancels Las Vegas Show", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-839510740-73b3b28a-69ba-4e26-b822-40ec81036425.jpg?w=1024&h=683&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504536420.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
