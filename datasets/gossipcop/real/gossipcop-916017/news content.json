Alongside a picture of Lautner holding up his pup and kissing her on the face, the actor recalled when his parents first gave him Roxy.\n\n\"Roxy, my family surprised me with you on the set of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 2004,\" he began his message. \"You have brought so much joy into my life for the past 13 1/2 years. I\u2019ll miss you every day but I\u2019ll take those memories with me everywhere I go. I love you.\"\n\nAccording to Taylor's sister, Makena, who also shared her own personal Instagram post, Roxy died one week ago.\n\nLautner isn't the only celeb who's recently lost a pet. Molly Sims' 18-year-old dog, Poupette, died earlier this month. Chelsea Handler and Christina Aguilera also paid tributes to their beloved dogs in January.\n\nMeanwhile, Khloe Kardashian also grieved the loss of her canine, Gabbana. The reality star's boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, sent her a stunning floral arrangement that was in a shape of a giant paw print to honor Kardashian's late pet.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/taylor_lautner_GettyImages-621304492.jpg?h=3ae4097c", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2024-02/Simu_Allison_GettyImages-2016310573_1920.jpg?h=b8626526&width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/taylor_lautner_GettyImages-621304492.jpg?h=3ae4097c&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-01/148437_9032.jpg?h=75acbfd4&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-01/lisa_vanderpump_hero_gettyimages-188039818.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-01/1280_molly_sims_getty902396146.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/taylor_lautner_GettyImages-621304492.jpg?h=3ae4097c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/taylor-lautner-mourns-death-of-beloved-dog-roxy-ill-miss-you-everyday-97042", "title": "Taylor Lautner Mourns Death of Beloved Dog Roxy: 'I'll Miss You Everyday'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/taylor_lautner_GettyImages-621304492.jpg?h=3ae4097c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 26-year-old actor shared the sad news on social media on Friday.", "title": "Taylor Lautner Mourns Death of Beloved Dog Roxy: 'I'll Miss You Everyday'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/taylor-lautner-mourns-death-of-beloved-dog-roxy-ill-miss-you-everyday-97042", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 26-year-old actor shared the sad news on social media on Friday.", "twitter": {"description": "The 26-year-old actor shared the sad news on social media on Friday.", "title": "Taylor Lautner Mourns Death of Beloved Dog Roxy: 'I'll Miss You Everyday'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/taylor-lautner-mourns-death-of-beloved-dog-roxy-ill-miss-you-everyday-97042", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/taylor_lautner_GettyImages-621304492.jpg?h=3ae4097c", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Taylor Lautner Mourns Death of Beloved Dog Roxy: 'I'll Miss You Everyday' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Taylor Lautner", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
