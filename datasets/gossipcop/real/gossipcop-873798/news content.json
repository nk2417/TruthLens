Warner Bros. hired an outside firm to \u201clook into everything that supposedly happened\u201d and \u201cthey concluded that there was no evidence of misconduct by cast on the set,\u201d he continued. \u201cDo you trust that conclusion?\u201d\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nThe contestants then unanimously agreed and the conversation turned to their support for not only Corinne and DeMario, but also the show\u2019s producers and staff. \u201cI was confident that nothing happened between DeMario and Corinne that was bad,\u201d said Raven Gates. \u201cI trusted everyone that worked here, so I knew everything was going to be okay.\u201d \u201cI think there was a lot in the media regarding the producers as if they\u2019re not our friends and they\u2019re just using us to make us do things like we\u2019re going to just do whatever they say,\u201d Alex Woytkiw added.\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nDerek Peth then jumped in saying, \u201cI think there\u2019s a weird perception that exists out there that we\u2019re not in control of ourselves when we\u2019re here. \u2026 We all know how realistic the friendships are with and among the cast. \u2026 We are here to make our own decisions and develop real relationships with everybody.\u201d The cast then discussed how they believed race played a role in how the situation was handled.\n\nWant OK! each day? Sign up here!\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sensitive to it because I\u2019m from the South and we have a stigma that seeing a white woman with a black man is wrong,\u201d Raven said. \u201cAnd that night, what happened wasn\u2019t wrong. And so I was super empathetic with DeMario because it\u2019s just another issue. Not only is consent important, but it\u2019s also to get rid of the stigma that interracial couples can\u2019t be or blaming African American men for crimes they didn\u2019t commit.\u201d\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nJasmine Goode then added that she was thinking about the long-term repercussions for DeMario even after he was cleared of any wrongdoing. \u201cI was just thinking the whole time: what if this happened to my brother?\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy from the guy I met here \u2026 and I never felt he was aggressive with any of us. \u2026 I just hate that he\u2019s going to have this image stuck with him for a while.\u201d The group also discussed consent and slut shaming, with Chris leading the conversation as he asked the cast to define consent before telling everything to \u201ckeep consent in mind,\u201d especially while in Paradise and \u201cfor forever.\u201d\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nChris then asked the group if they wanted to be there and if they agreed with the show resuming filming following the incident. \u201cKnowing what we all know now, having lived through what we\u2019ve all lived through and experienced \u2014 the shutdown, the scandal, the accusations, everything we\u2019ve all endured \u2014 do each of you want to be here?\u201d he asked. \u201cIf the majority of you feels like we should not continue, then we will not continue the show. Please be 100 percent honest because it\u2019s important that we get this right. And so I want to literally go person-by-person,\u201d Chris said before asking each contestant one-by-one if they wanted to continue the show.", "images": ["https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/gwn3vFiVn/1200x628/2017/08/bachelor-in-paradise-cast-finally-address-shows-sex-scandal-hero.jpg", "https://okmagazine.com/ok_logo_white.png", "https://okmagazine.com/ok_logo_black.png"], "top_img": "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/gwn3vFiVn/1200x628/2017/08/bachelor-in-paradise-cast-finally-address-shows-sex-scandal-hero.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://okmagazine.com/videos/bachelor-in-paradise-cast-finally-address-shows-sex-scandal/", "title": "The \u2018Bachelor In Paradise\u2019 Cast Finally Addresses The Show\u2019s Sex Scandal & It's SERIOUSLY Intense", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "theme-color": "#000", "robots": "max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "In the second half of\u00a0Bachelor In Paradise\u2019s two-night premiere, the\u00a0BIP\u00a0cast addressed the sexual encounter that occurred between\u00a0DeMario", "keywords": "VIDEOS,NEWS", "og": {"site_name": "OK Magazine", "title": "The \u2018Bachelor In Paradise\u2019 Cast Finally Addresses The Show\u2019s Sex Scandal & It's SERIOUSLY Intense", "url": "https://okmagazine.com/videos/bachelor-in-paradise-cast-finally-address-shows-sex-scandal/", "description": "In the second half of\u00a0Bachelor In Paradise\u2019s two-night premiere, the\u00a0BIP\u00a0cast addressed the sexual encounter that occurred between\u00a0DeMario", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/gwn3vFiVn/1200x628/2017/08/bachelor-in-paradise-cast-finally-address-shows-sex-scandal-hero.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 628, "type": "image/jpeg", "alt": "ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Bachelor in Paradise&#8221; &#8211; Season Four"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-16T18:35:37.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-16T19:17:02.000Z", "author": "Lauren Crawford"}, "twitter": {"site": "@okmagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The \u2018Bachelor In Paradise\u2019 Cast Finally Addresses The Show\u2019s Sex Scandal & It's SERIOUSLY Intense", "description": "In the second half of\u00a0Bachelor In Paradise\u2019s two-night premiere, the\u00a0BIP\u00a0cast addressed the sexual encounter that occurred between\u00a0DeMario", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.okmagazine.com/brand-img/gwn3vFiVn/1200x628/2017/08/bachelor-in-paradise-cast-finally-address-shows-sex-scandal-hero.jpg", "alt": "ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Bachelor in Paradise&#8221; &#8211; Season Four"}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502908537.0, "source": "https://okmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
