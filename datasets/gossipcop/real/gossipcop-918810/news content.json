E! has canceled the one-hour drama series after four seasons, Variety has learned.\n\n\u201cE! will not be moving forward with another season of \u2018The Royals,\u2019 which launched in 2015 as the network\u2019s first original scripted series,\u201d a spokesperson for E! told Variety in a statement. \u201cOver four seasons, \u2018The Royals\u2019 took viewers behind the palace gates on a scandalous journey filled with twists and turns. We are grateful to the cast and our producing partners at Lionsgate and Universal Cable Productions.\u201d\n\nSeason 4 of the series aired between March and May earlier this year. In Live+Same Day viewing, the season averaged a 0.2 rating in adults 18-49 and around 400,000 viewers per episode, down approximately 30% in the key demo from Season 3. Sources say that the show could continue at the cable network Pop, which is a joint venture between CBS Entertainment and Lionsgate Entertainment. Though sources also caution that any deal with Pop is by no means final, it would make sense given that Lionsgate Television co-produces \u201cThe Royals\u201d with Universal Cable Productions.\n\nStarring Elizabeth Hurley, \u201cThe Royals\u201d followed a fictional modern day royal family as they find love, conspire against one another, and are forced to face long-hidden secrets, all in the name of the crown. In addition to Hurley, it also starred Max Brown, William Moseley, Jake Maskall, Tom Austen, Alexandra Park, and Genevieve Gaunt. Brian Robbins, Joe Davola, and Shauna Phelan served as executive producers.\n\nThe cancellation comes after series creator and showrunner Mark Schwahn was fired from the show in December after Varietyreported on detailed allegations of sexual harassment during his time on \u201cOne Tree Hill.\u201d Twenty-five cast and crew members of \u201cThe Royals\u201d also called out Schwahn\u2019s behavior, saying in a letter that Schwahn engaged in \u201crepeated unwanted sexual harassment of multiple female members of cast and crew.\u201d\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nIt\u2019s official: \u2018black-ish\u2019 creator Kenya Barris moves to Netflix with overall deal\n\nAretha Franklin: 18 major events in the singer\u2019s life\n\nFree Chicago museum tickets offered for national Museum Day", "images": ["data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2560px-Chicago_Tribune_Logo.svg-1.png", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/chicago-tribune-logo-basic.jpeg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/chicago-tribune-logo-basic.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Otterson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2018/08/16/the-royals-canceled-after-four-seasons-at-e/", "title": "\u2018The Royals\u2019 canceled after four seasons at E!", "meta_data": {"application-name": "chicagotribune", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Joe Otterson", "canonical": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2018/08/16/the-royals-canceled-after-four-seasons-at-e/"}, "description": "\u201cThe Royals\u2018\u201d reign has come to an end.
