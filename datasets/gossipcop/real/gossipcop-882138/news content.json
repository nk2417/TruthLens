The couple had been together on and off for years but tied the knot in November of last year.\n\nShe has now filed for divorce after an alleged domestic violence incident. Audrina\u2019s rep requests that people respect the star\u2019s privacy during this time and stressed that her main priority is to care for the couple\u2019s daughter.\n\nMeanwhile, E! News managed to chat to Audrina\u2019s ex Justin Bobby to see what he had to say on the matter.\n\nBobby, who appeared on The Hills as Audrina\u2019s on-again-off-again boyfriend, said:\n\n\u201cMy first reaction is the thought of the child, obviously. Me, coming from a separated family at a young age, it had its perks and it had its hindrances. My second thought is if she\u2019s OK, because she\u2019s been a longtime friend. My thoughts and my heart go out to her and her little one at this time.\u201d\n\nHe then went on to speak about how he feels Audrina will deal with the situation:", "images":
