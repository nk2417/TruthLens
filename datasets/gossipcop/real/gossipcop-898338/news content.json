On Monday night, during a talk moderated by Vanity Fair\u2019s Mike Hogan at 92nd Street Y in New York City with co-star Claire Foy, Smith did not mince words about his feelings on the fate of Prince Harry\u2019s royal-to-be fianc\u00e9e, Meghan Markle.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for her,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a transition in her life, and it\u2019s such a huge thing to take on. Life as she knows it is gone. But hey, she\u2019s marrying the prince of Britain\u2014how exciting for her.\u201d\n\nThough he plays a fictional royal, Smith understands a thing or two about the complex life of Prince Philip, who reluctantly lived in the Queen\u2019s shadow for the better part of his early marriage. Philip, a naval officer in the mid-20th century, had to make several sacrifices that many other husbands at the time did not. As V.F. has noted, Philip was unable to give his children his surname\u2014a request the Queen rejected.\n\n\u201cI am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children,\u201d Philip said on the subject, per a biography by Sally Bedell Smith. \u201cI\u2019m nothing but a bloody amoeba.\u201d", "images":
