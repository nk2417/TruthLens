Though fans know they met while they were both attending LaGuardia High School, Komyshan provided more details to Cosmopolitan about their teenage meet-cute.\n\n\u201cI think he had his eye on me because we were in the same lunch period or something,\u201d she shared, adding that she and her friend ran into him on the street. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know he went to my school \u2014 I just thought he was really attractive. I looked at him and told my friend, \u2018Oh my God, that guy\u2019s so hot,\u2019 and she\u2019s like, \u2018Oh that\u2019s Ansel, he goes to LaGuardia.'\u201d\n\nElgort introduced himself but his now-girlfriend though he liked her friend until the next day.\n\n\u201cHe waited for me [after school] the next day and told our friend to introduce us and I was like, \u2018OK, he totally liked me yesterday,\u2019 \u201d she continued. \u201cThen I made her come with us to Starbucks. We exchanged numbers and became friends, and then we started dating when I was at the end of sophomore year.\u201d\n\nIn addition to being Komyshan\u2019s boyfriend, Elgort, who is the son of famed Vogue photographer Arthur Elgort, doubles as her cameraman.\n\n\u201cHe knows my light, he knows everything,\u201d she said. \u201cHe could just be my personal photographer and he\u2019d be great at it because he\u2019s so good.\u201d", "images": ["https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Fblomingdales.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115847739.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115919105.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/ansel-violetta.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2FFF-WP.png?w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115916411.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115918976.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/ansel-violetta.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115875312.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&c3=PAGESIX&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115879604.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115838388.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/paige2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115901196.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115919105.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2Felemis-black-friday.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1763642967&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115883447.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115905155.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115918976.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260&h=174&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115874796.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F3%2F2025%2F11%2F115918332.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=93&h=62&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115905155.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/115901196.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=87"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/ansel-violetta.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/12/11/ansel-elgorts-girlfriend-details-how-they-met-in-high-school/", "title": "Ansel Elgort\u2019s girlfriend details how they met in high school", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
