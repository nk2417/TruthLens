Impact Link\n\nThe INSIDER Summary:\n\nTaylor Swift spent a week in court last week after two lawsuits from an alleged assault incident.\n\nNo cameras were allowed in the courtroom.\n\nAs a result, courtroom sketches were released of Swift and the attendees.\n\nFans were quick to point out that they didn't look like the singer at all.\n\nThe artist behind the sketches said it's hard to draw someone as pretty as Swift.\n\n\n\nIt may be easy to conjure an image of Taylor Swift to mind, but drawing the superstar singer is apparently more difficult than it looks.\n\nAfter receiving criticism for his courtroom sketches of Swift during her trial against Denver-based JD David Mueller for an alleged assault in 2013, the artist behind the drawings is speaking out saying the singer is just too pretty to capture in a courtroom sketch.\n\n\"A person like Taylor Swift, who is very pretty \u2014 has perfectly proportioned dimensions on the face \u2014 is actually much harder [to sketch],\" Jeff Kandyba, a Boulder-based artist who has been sketching in courtrooms since the '80s told Fox 31 Denver.\n\nThe sketches of Swift started to spread around after fans noticed the singer looked pretty unrecognizable.\n\nTaylor Swift, is that you?

(The two singers have some bad blood.)\n\nKandyba said he did practice sketching Swift ahead of time, but it can be more difficult creating a still image in his mind of a person who is moving around.\n\n\"It's hard. Some people are just much easier to draw than others,\" Kandyba said. \"If you give me somebody with a beard and glasses \u2014 bingo \u2014 got it.\"", "images": ["https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5993212b0dafe82dba3b9d17?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5993212b0dafe82dba3b9d17?width=700", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5993212b0dafe82dba3b9d17?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kirsten Acuna"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-courtroom-sketches-too-pretty-2017-8", "title": "Here's why those Taylor Swift courtroom drawings were so terrible", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Here's why those Taylor Swift courtroom drawings were so terrible", "datePublished": "2017-08-15T16:27:52.000Z", "dateModified": "2017-08-15T16:27:55.000Z", "news_keywords": "News, Taylor Swift", "description": "The artist behind the courtroom sketches of Taylor Swift says it's difficult to draw a person who has \"perfectly proportioned dimensions on the face.\"", "author": "Kirsten Acuna", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider"}, "tbi-vertical": "News", "og": {"title": "Here's why those Taylor Swift courtroom drawings were so terrible", "description": "The artist behind the courtroom sketches of Taylor Swift says it's difficult to draw a person who has \"perfectly proportioned dimensions on the face.\"", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-courtroom-sketches-too-pretty-2017-8", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.insider.com/5993212b0dafe82dba3b9d17?width=1200&format=jpeg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@businessinsider"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"psvp": "c"}, "user-status": "anonymous", "viking-id": "5993212d0dafe82dba3b9d1d", "env": "prod", "mrf": {"sections": "News", "tags": "Page Type:story"}, "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2025-05", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
