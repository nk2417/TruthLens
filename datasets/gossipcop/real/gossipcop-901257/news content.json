After playing college football at Yale University, Johnson spent seven seasons in the NFL with the San Francisco 49ers and New Orleans Saints. Eric Johnson is better known for being married to actress/singer/entrepreneur Jessica Simpson. They were married from 2014 to 2025. They announced their separation after 10 years of marriage on January 14, 2025. At the time of their separation, Jessica Simpson's net worth was $200 million.\n\nJohnson's football career began at Yale, where he excelled as a wide receiver and was named to the All-Ivy League team. The San Francisco 49ers selected him in the seventh round of the 2001 NFL Draft, where he transitioned to tight end. His best professional season came in 2004, when he caught 82 passes for 825 yards and two touchdowns. Injuries began to impact his career during his later years with the 49ers, and after a brief stint with the New Orleans Saints, he retired from professional football in 2008.\n\nRelationship with Jessica Simpson\n\nIn May 2010, Johnson began dating Jessica Simpson, shortly after his divorce from his first wife, Keri. The couple's relationship quickly became a fixture in celebrity media coverage, with Johnson often appearing alongside Simpson at public events. They announced their engagement in November 2010, and Johnson became stepfather to Simpson's daughter from her previous marriage to Nick Lachey.\n\nFamily Life and Marriage\n\nThe couple welcomed their first child together, daughter Maxwell Drew, in May 2012, followed by son Ace Knute in June 2013. Johnson and Simpson married on July 5, 2014, in a lavish ceremony in Montecito, California. They later welcomed their third child together, daughter Birdie Mae, in March 2019. Throughout their marriage, Johnson was frequently praised by Simpson in interviews and social media posts for his dedication as a father and partner.\n\nReal Estate\n\nJessica and Eric's longtime marital home is a palatial estate in Hidden Hills, California, which she bought from Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne for $11.5 million in 2013. Over the years, Eric and Jessica performed extensive remodels to the 2.5-acre property, which features six bedrooms, a basketball court, a playground, and a large pool. Today this property is worth $15 \u2013 20 million based on comparable recent sales. Here is an aerial video of the home:\n\nDivorce\n\nAfter ten years of marriage, Johnson and Simpson announced their separation on January 14, 2025. The couple released a joint statement expressing their mutual respect and commitment to co-parenting their three children. During their decade together, Johnson had supported Simpson through various personal challenges, including her sobriety journey, which she documented in her 2020 memoir \"Open Book.\"\n\nSince retiring from football, Johnson has maintained a relatively low public profile, focusing primarily on family life and various business ventures. He has occasionally appeared in Simpson's social media posts and at public events supporting her fashion empire and other business endeavors, though he has largely stayed out of the entertainment industry spotlight.", "images": ["https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/1JoH3482haSLevnlEMdqhrz36y0=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/11/George-Clooney.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/uRsxoLs7Ymmit5ATgRtN2utad40=/221x5:381x236/132x132/filters:format(webp):strip_exif()/2009/09/P-Diddy.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/fVsw-yhbN7a9--kXOlX4cxHeze4=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/01/jessica-simpson-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/KNDSqD-9inbRekV6AGgXDEG2Scw=/375x35:810x586/132x132/filters:format(webp):strip_exif()/2015/09/GettyImages-476575299.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/themes/cnw_2023/svg/logo.svg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/DIwAiOTYJrNk2Ms400icMkKyEWw=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2012/05/joe-simp.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/0dOqT2nlNQM7u_J-5xWrCsf2nAw=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/02/Angelina-Jolie.png", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/Y14fttV9jls9mxFLuNAHJTnNWTE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/10/denzel-washington-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/yboGsO77E1kQwELLmrwRZv_4RmE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2017/02/GettyImages-528215436.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/lt1abKKVHSBtY-US0k9GLU9MTmM=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/09/Brad-Pitt.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Eric-Johnson1.jpg?x46379", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/07Env2ZoZGwJBEmnEYJvJF31xDg=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2013/01/GettyImages-75417196.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/vuKRfs1-o3HUQlkpuoTgSmubFUA=/600x300/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2013/09/Eric-Johnson1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/KL5CqV8_ayLlG7be02lck7r2mkQ=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2013/12/GettyImages-90801254.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/lY3-oCS-xIdiqDaOi1qHd6UaTjg=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/09/Cristiano-Ronaldo.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/UxnQSql1h0QyX1CgkPqKhTxCTHM=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/09/Jennifer-Aniston.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/95i5RI1LWkjHyyoolMeto-z_WeU=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/01/lopez3.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/KFAqJ9F4o80l6an2fe78-0jw28s=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/04/rr.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/i7ejax_ITeSQ5rejczlURxsLjfE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2014/06/Cacee-Cobb1-e1590972291399.jpg"], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Eric-Johnson1.jpg?x46379", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-athletes/nfl/eric-johnson-net-worth-2/", "title": "Eric Johnson Net Worth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Eric Johnson Net Worth: Eric Johnson is an American football player who has a net worth of $20 million.
