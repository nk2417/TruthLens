They hurt sometimes, and sometimes they\u2019re the thing that makes me feel the most powerful,\u201d the 26-year-old Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model explained. \u201cThey\u2019re a key to my sexuality.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) on May 10, 2018 at 2:44pm PDT\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all those things,\u201d she added. \u201cI remember there was some article like \u2018Emily Ratajkowski Is the Mozart of Breasts.\u2019 What was so bad is someone sent it to my dad, who sent it to me. My dad still sees me as a little kid. I love my boobs. I love other people\u2019s boobs. Boobs are kind of great.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) on Jul 26, 2017 at 9:46am PDT\n\nThe swimsuit beauty also shared that she is not messing around when it comes to getting Hollywood to take her seriously.\n\nA post shared by Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) on Mar 2, 2018 at 6:32pm PST\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually something I\u2019ve thought about a lot without ever saying seriousness in my head,\u201d the model shared. \u201cI care a lot. I think I freak people out sometimes going into meeting with Hollywood producers \u2026 with f*cking guns blazing. I had something to prove, and it had very little to do with my acting ability or the way I looked. It was about the \u2018Take me seriously. Look me in the eye.'\u201d\n\nThe comments come after she made headlines last year when people thought the model said that her big boobs had kept her from getting jobs in the fashion and entertainment industry. She later clarified her statement that the comment was about the fashion industry, not Hollywood.", "images":
