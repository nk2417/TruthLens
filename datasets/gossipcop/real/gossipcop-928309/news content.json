Patti Murin, who plays Princess Anna in the musical Frozen, opened up about her rough journey with anxiety after having to cancel a performance on Tuesday night (April 17).\n\n\u201cSo last night I called out of the show because I had a massive anxiety attack in the afternoon,\u201d the actress wrote in an Instagram post on Wednesday. \u201cIt had been building up for a while, and while the past month has been incredible, all of the ups and downs and stress and excitement really takes a toll on my mental health.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnxiety and depression are real diseases that affect so many of us. It requires a lot of rest and self care to heal every time it becomes more than I can handle in my daily life,\u201d she continued.\n\nShe also took the opportunity to encourage a positive outlook for her followers who might be experiencing the same things. \u201cJust remember that you\u2019re not alone, your feelings are real, and this is not your fault. Even Disney princesses are terrified sometimes.\u201d\n\nSee the post below.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Patti-Murin-april-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=628&crop=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Patti-Murin-april-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Patti-Murin-april-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rania Aniftos", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/culture/lifestyle/patti-murin-cancels-frozen-broadway-performance-due-to-anxiety-8348567/", "title": "Patti Murin Cancels \u2018Frozen\u2019 Broadway Performance Due to Anxiety", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Patti Murin, who plays Princess Anna in the musical Frozen, opened up about her rough journey with anxiety after having to cancel a performance on Tuesday night (April 17).", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Rania Aniftos", "tags": "bbnews, broadway", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Patti Murin Cancels \u2018Frozen\u2019 Broadway Performance Due to Anxiety", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/culture/lifestyle/patti-murin-cancels-frozen-broadway-performance-due-to-anxiety-8348567/", "description": "Patti Murin, who plays Princess Anna in the musical Frozen, opened up about her rough journey with anxiety after having to cancel a performance on Tuesday night (April 17).", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Patti-Murin-april-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Patti Murin"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-18T22:27:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-19T18:46:14+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Patti Murin, who plays Princess Anna in the musical Frozen, opened up about her rough journey with anxiety after having to cancel a performance on Tuesday night (April 17).", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Patti Murin Cancels \u2018Frozen\u2019 Broadway Performance Due to Anxiety", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Patti-Murin-april-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524090460.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
