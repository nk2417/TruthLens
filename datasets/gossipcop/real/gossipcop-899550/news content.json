When I\u2019m home in Los Angeles, it\u2019s like one meal a day.\"\n\nStassi added, \"But when I go out of town or on work trips, it\u2019s breakfast, lunch and dinner.\"\n\nNow, this is an object lesson in the danger of print interviews.\n\nIf Stassi had tearfully confessed that she starves herself, the Mail would\u2019ve said so.\n\nAs it is, they didn\u2019t describe her inflection at all, so we think it\u2019s safe to say that Stassi wasn\u2019t actually opening up to a group of Aussie strangers about her eating disorder, but was instead simply joking.\n\nSure enough, Stassi recently cleared things up on social media, tweeting:\n\n\"Mmm. There was an element of sarcasm while I was doing that interview,\" along with several food emojis.\n\nSadly, emojis for ranch dressing and fried goat cheese balls don\u2019t exist yet.\n\nOf course, her diet is far from the most dramatic element of Stassi\u2019s life these days.\n\nOn last night\u2019s episode of Vanderpump, viewers finally got to meet her longtime on-again, off-again boyfriend, Patrick Meagher.\n\nBecause people on the internet are easily confused, the appearance sparked rumors that Stassi and Patrick are back together.\n\nAs far as we know, that\u2019s not true, which is a good thing, as dude is a chronic mansplainer and he looks like Riff Raff.\n\nGet you a man that looks like Khal Drogo and knows how to mix up a top-notch strawberry margarita, girl!\n\nWatch Vanderpump Rules online to get caught up on what\u2019s already been one hell of a drama-packed season.", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/liz-johnston-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-85595140-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1118_porshawilliams_01-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1118_kesslertwins_header-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/stassi-schroeder-in-black-720x540.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/Sister-Wives-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/1118_doordashgirl_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1352333175-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247337048-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/stassi-schroeder-in-black-scaled.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/stassi-schroeder-snapshot-680x1024.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/stassi-schroeder-in-black-683x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/amber-portwood-and-andrew-glennon-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/the-bachelor-season-22-group-shot-320x240.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/stassi-schroeder-in-black-scaled.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tyler Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/12/stassi-schroeder-i-starve-myself-to-stay-thin/", "title": "Stassi Schroeder: I Starve Myself to Stay Thin!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Stassi Schroeder: I Starve Myself to Stay Thin!", "description": "There's certainly been no shortage of drama thus far on Vanderpump Rules Season 6.
