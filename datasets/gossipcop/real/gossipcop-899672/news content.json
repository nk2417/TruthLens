Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging.\n\nAt such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story.\n\nThe Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it.", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/14/09/star-wars-last-jedi-0.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/14/09/star-wars-last-jedi-0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/14/09/star-wars-last-jedi-0.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/star-wars-the-last-jedi-premiere-bb8-prince-william-and-harry-cameos-stormtroopers-a8109266.html", "title": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi: BB-8 bowed to Prince William and Harry at the premiere", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/films/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "The droid clearly knows its royal protocol", "og": {"updated_time": "2017-12-14T09:56:11.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "BB-8 bowed to Prince Harry and William at the Star Wars premiere", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/films/news/star-wars-the-last-jedi-premiere-bb8-prince-william-and-harry-cameos-stormtroopers-a8109266.html", "type": "article", "description": "The droid clearly knows its royal protocol", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/14/09/star-wars-last-jedi-0.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/14/09/star-wars-last-jedi-0.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-14T09:56:11.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-12-14T09:56:11.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Film", "author_name": "Clarisse Loughrey", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 273, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 4, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 1, "external_link_count": 2}, "date": "2017-12-14T09:56:11.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176832122"}, "twitter": {"title": "BB-8 bowed to Prince Harry and William at the Star Wars premiere", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The droid clearly knows its royal protocol", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/14/09/star-wars-last-jedi-0.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\",\"Prince William\",\"Prince Harry\",\"Star Wars\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513245371.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
