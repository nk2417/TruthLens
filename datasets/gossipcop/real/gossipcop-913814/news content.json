By multiple accounts, the uber-showrunner is ready to move on to a new chapter of her career \u2013 one that gives her and her Shondaland factory far more room to maneuver from a creative perspective.\n\nBroadcast TV is still the biggest platform in the traditional TV universe but it has become increasingly less attractive to creatives, especially those like Rhimes who have nothing left to prove in the network TV arena.\n\nAs development for the 2018-19 cranks into high gear, industry insiders are grousing about a general stasis when it comes to dealmaking and a lack of ambition in programming at a time when the array of material on competing outlets has never been more diverse. \u201cSo many remakes and reboots \u2013 why?\u201d lamented one top agent.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nOn the flip side, many network executives privately say they feel like they\u2019re under siege. Success for them is still defined by broad-based hits \u2013 think \u201cThis Is Us\u201d \u2013 but smaller rivals are forking over significantly more money and perks (longer production schedules, shorter episode orders, flexibility in format and length) to draw high-wattage talent.\n\nExecutives point to changes in the traditional network playbook such as ABC granting Viola Davis\u2019 wish to do 15 episodes a season of Shondaland\u2019s \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d rather than the standard 22. NBC last season similarly recognized showrunner Michael Schur\u2019s desire to deliver 13 episodes per season of his offbeat comedy \u201cThe Good Place.\u201d\n\nFrom ABC\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s hard to watch Rhimes walk out the door \u2013 except that she\u2019s still doing a lot of day-to-day business with them and will be for the foreseeable future. In the coming season, Rhimes has no less than five series in various stages of production \u2013 \u201cGrey\u2019s,\u201d \u201cHTGAWM,\u201d the final season of \u201cScandal,\u201d new midseason legal drama \u201cFor the People\u201d and the untitled \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d spinoff revolving around firefighters. And there\u2019s at least one Shondaland pilot in the hopper for the 2018-19 season.\n\nABC Studios has expanded its focus to producing shows for non-ABC outlets, including its Marvel series for Netflix and the Showtime comedy \u201cSMILF.\u201d Surely, ABC Studios would have bent over backwards to craft a deal that would have afforded Shondaland plenty of leeway to develop for other outlets. But at the same time, the appeal of a heavy courtship from Netflix is easy to understand. No ratings, more creative control, subject matter that need not be mass appeal \u2014 for a showrunner who has worked at a prolific pace for 15 years, what\u2019s not to love?\n\nRhimes\u2019 deal is unlike any other talent pact that the streaming giant has made to date. The company will provide generous overhead for Shondaland and its roughly 30 employees. Rhimes herself will see hefty upfront payments for her work on various shows. Industry sources speculated that the deal would largely be front-loaded with fees because of the fact that Netflix shows live in a walled-garden of the streaming giant\u2019s global platform. There are no international licensing deals or off-network sales to factor into profit participation deals.\n\nGiven Rhimes\u2019 stature, however, industry veterans said there is undoubtedly some formula established for additional profit participation, possibly structured around the number of episodes or seasons produced per show. Reps for Rhimes declined to comment on the financial terms.\n\nEven more than the bottom-line concerns, the optics of Rhimes deciding to change lanes and channel her creative energy into Netflix productions is a hit to broadcast TV\u2019s image. The showrunner will keep one foot firmly planted in her legacy shows for the time being \u2014 but for the future, Rhimes has voted with her feet.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shonda-rhimes-masterclass.jpg?w=1000&h=564&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shonda-rhimes-masterclass.jpg?crop=0px%2C7px%2C1000px%2C557px&resize=1000%2C563", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shonda-rhimes-masterclass.jpg?crop=0px%2C7px%2C1000px%2C557px&resize=1000%2C563", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cynthia Littleton", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/shonda-rhimes-netflix-abc-shondaland-1202527491/", "title": "What Shonda Rhimes\u2019 Move to Netflix Means for Broadcast TV", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Shonda Rhimes\u2019 decision to leave the fold at ABC Studios for Netflix is a blow to Disney and a blow to broadcast TV in general.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Cynthia Littleton", "tags": "ABC Studios, Shonda Rhimes", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "What Shonda Rhimes\u2019 Move to Netflix Means for Broadcast TV", "url": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/shonda-rhimes-netflix-abc-shondaland-1202527491/", "description": "Shonda Rhimes\u2019 decision to leave the fold at ABC Studios for Netflix is a blow to Disney and a blow to broadcast TV in general.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shonda-rhimes-masterclass.jpg?crop=0px%2C7px%2C1000px%2C557px&resize=1000%2C563", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Shonda Rhimes TV Writing Class"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-14T23:27:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-14T23:27:29+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Shonda Rhimes\u2019 decision to leave the fold at ABC Studios for Netflix is a blow to Disney and a blow to broadcast TV in general.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@Variety_Cynthia", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "What Shonda Rhimes\u2019 Move to Netflix Means for Broadcast TV", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/shonda-rhimes-masterclass.jpg?crop=0px%2C7px%2C1000px%2C557px&resize=1000%2C563"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502753249.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
