He saw how people reacted to it. He reached out to us and he's like, 'Hey, can I jump on the remix?' and we're like, 'Yes, sir!'\"\n\n\"He did his thing, you know, he sang his verse in English [and then] he sang the chorus in Spanish,\" Fonsi added. \"We were surprised.\"", "images": ["https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/cf5439d4-7025-456b-907c-f070ca1b0c16/20251120T042957/cf5439d4-7025-456b-907c-f070ca1b0c16_360x203.jpg", "https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/ccfbabe6-2dea-4754-a17a-95661a3cd47c/20251119T220402/ccfbabe6-2dea-4754-a17a-95661a3cd47c_360x203.jpg", "https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/logos/kusa.png", "https://media.9news.com/assets/KUSA/images/e6e08cc1-91c1-4a8e-b00e-71934ef054b2/20251119T103639/e6e08cc1-91c1-4a8e-b00e-71934ef054b2_360x203.jpg", "https://media.9news.com/assets/AssociatedPress/images/6286472a-4ee1-4926-a2c6-33b37e9f7a23/20251120T034510/6286472a-4ee1-4926-a2c6-33b37e9f7a23_360x203.jpg", "https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/weather-icons/partly-cloudy-night_210x210.png", "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/06/16/1280set_luis_fonsi_GettyImages632684604_9832113_ver1.0.jpg", "https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/icons/facebook.svg", "https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/logos/native/kusa.svg", "https://www.9news.com/assets/shared-images/icons/close-menu.svg"], "top_img": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/06/16/1280set_luis_fonsi_GettyImages632684604_9832113_ver1.0.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.9news.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-tonight/luis-fonsi-says-justin-bieber-deserves-a-pass-for-not-knowing-the-lyrics-to-despacito/73-449711767", "title": "Luis Fonsi Says Justin Bieber Deserves a 'Pass' for Not Knowing the Lyrics to 'Despacito'", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#045ea8", "category": "entertainment", "og": {"url": "https://www.9news.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-tonight/luis-fonsi-says-justin-bieber-deserves-a-pass-for-not-knowing-the-lyrics-to-despacito/73-449711767", "title": "Luis Fonsi Says Justin Bieber Deserves a 'Pass' for Not Knowing the Lyrics to 'Despacito'", "description": "Luis Fonsi doesn't blame Justin Bieber for failing to learn the words to \"Despacito.\"The singer-songwriter came to Bieber's defense after the pop star was recorded", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/06/16/1280set_luis_fonsi_GettyImages632684604_9832113_ver1.0.jpg", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "6/16/2017 2:37:00 PM"}, "site_name": "KUSA.com", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "section": "9news,entertainment,entertainment-tonight"}, "twitter": {"title": "Luis Fonsi Says Justin Bieber Deserves a 'Pass' for Not Knowing the Lyrics to 'Despacito'", "image": "http://content.tegna-media.com/photo/2017/06/16/1280set_luis_fonsi_GettyImages632684604_9832113_ver1.0.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "9NEWS", "description": "Luis Fonsi doesn't blame Justin Bieber for failing to learn the words to \"Despacito.\"The singer-songwriter came to Bieber's defense after the pop star was recorded", "domain": "www.9news.com/"}, "viewport": "width=1170", "site": "9news.com", "description": "<p>Luis Fonsi doesn't blame Justin Bieber for failing to learn the words to \"Despacito.\"</p><p>The singer-songwriter came to Bieber's defense after the pop star was recorded <a href=\"http://www.etonline.com/news/218321_justin_bieber_doesn_t_remember_the_spanish_words_to_despacito_watch/\" target=\"_blank\">butchering the lyrics</a> to the Spanish-language hit single during an appearance at 1Oak in New York City last month.</p>", "fb": {"app_id": 1760372210700146}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497638220.0, "source": "https://www.9news.com", "summary": ""}
