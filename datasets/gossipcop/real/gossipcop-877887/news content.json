They tend to be more energetic and adventurous. Nevin and I are looking forward to meeting our boy and getting to know him. It's great to have a balance of both daughter and son and we are very grateful to experience that.\u201d\n\nThe 36-year-old dancer said Amalya was just as excited to meet her baby brother.\n\n\"She can hardly contain herself!\" she gushed. \"She keeps playing the 'Family' game, where I'm Mama, she's sister and one of her dolls is a baby. I think it's her way of 'practicing,' it's so adorable. We pretend to change diapers, feeding baby bottles and putting baby to sleep. She's so nurturing, so we're hoping that carries over to her real baby brother.\"\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nAdditional reporting by Angelique Jackson.", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/anna_trebunskaya_nevin_millan_.jpg?h=0d6a4a19", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-03/et_socialstudypm_AnnaPreggo_031517_1280.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/anna_trebunskaya_nevin_millan_.jpg?h=0d6a4a19&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-08/anna_trebunskaya_nevin_millan_.jpg?h=0d6a4a19&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/anna_trebunskaya_nevin_millan_.jpg?h=0d6a4a19", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/former-dwts-pro-anna-trebunskaya-welcomes-baby-no-2-86660", "title": "Former 'DWTS' Pro Anna Trebunskaya Welcomes Baby No. 2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/anna_trebunskaya_nevin_millan_.jpg?h=0d6a4a19", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 36-year-old dancer and her longtime partner, Nevin Millan, are already parents to 3-year-old daughter Amalya.", "title": "Former 'DWTS' Pro Anna Trebunskaya Welcomes Baby No. 2", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/former-dwts-pro-anna-trebunskaya-welcomes-baby-no-2-86660", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 36-year-old dancer and her longtime partner, Nevin Millan, are already parents to 3-year-old daughter Amalya.", "twitter": {"description": "The 36-year-old dancer and her longtime partner, Nevin Millan, are already parents to 3-year-old daughter Amalya.", "title": "Former 'DWTS' Pro Anna Trebunskaya Welcomes Baby No. 2", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/former-dwts-pro-anna-trebunskaya-welcomes-baby-no-2-86660", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-08/anna_trebunskaya_nevin_millan_.jpg?h=0d6a4a19", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Former 'DWTS' Pro Anna Trebunskaya Welcomes Baby No. 2 | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Anna Trebunskaya, Dancing With The Stars", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
