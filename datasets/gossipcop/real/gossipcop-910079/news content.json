The music legend shut down the Grammys tonight when she arrived midway, joining husband Jay-Z in the audience, and given her gown, it was easy to see why. Dressed in all black by Nicolas Jebran and accented by a single white rose, the star smartly capped off a week filled with great looks chosen with her stylist, Marni Senofonte. Though the visual appeal of her latest look is instantly clear, the story behind it may come as a surprise.\n\nAccording to Jebran, the inspiration for the dress was rooted in the traditions of social justice. \u201cThe idea was to create a moment, a memorable design with meaning because it\u2019s more than just a gown,\u201d shared the designer via email from Paris. After he was contacted by Senofonte to create a custom piece for the event, Jebran sought to innovate. Though he\u2019s worked with Beyonc\u00e9 and her team in the past, creating one of a kind looks for appearances at the Video Music Awards and other events, the 2018 Grammys required something special.", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a6e88fc20d7ab26e12b80a2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Unknown-2.jpeg",
