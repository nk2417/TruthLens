{"url": "https://people.com/tv/karla-souza-alleges-she-was-raped-director-mexico/", "text": "Karla Souza has spoken out about a sustained campaign of sexual harassment and assault she allegedly sustained at the hands of a director.\n\nSouza, 32, told CNN en Espa\u00f1ol Tuesday that she was raped by a director early in her career.\n\nSpeaking to Carmen Aristegui, Souza, who now stars as Laurel Castillo in ABC\u2019s How to Get Away with Murder, said she was assaulted by the director while filming on location in her native Mexico. She declined to name the director.\n\nThe actress said she had been separated from fellow castmates as she was staying at a separate hotel where only she and the director had rooms. She claims he then started to drop by at odd hours.\n\n\u201cHe knocked at my door saying he wanted to go over some scenes and I thought it\u2019s 2 a.m., it\u2019s not appropriate and it\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t be happening,\u201d she said.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Women of Hollywood Attend Golden Globes Together in Support of the Time\u2019s Up Movement\n\nSouza claimed the director knocked on her door again, but when she refused to open it, he \u201cdecided not to shoot my scene and then he suddenly started to humiliate me in front of the others on the set.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was the psychological control that he held over me,\u201d she added.\n\nSouza said that after a month of bearing the brunt of the director\u2019s \u201ctotal abuse of power\u201d she felt she had no choice but to \u201cgive in\u201d.\n\n\u201cI ended up giving in to him. [I let him] kiss me, to touch me in ways I did not want him to touch me and in one of those instances, he attacked me violently and yes, he raped me,\u201d she said, wiping away tears.\n\nSouza\u2019s representative did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nTo donate to the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which will provide subsidized legal support to women and men in all industries who have experienced sexual harassment, assault, or abuse in the workplace, visit its GoFundMe page.

Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.\u201d", "images":
