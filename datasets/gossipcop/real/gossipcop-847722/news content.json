I was so young. It brought back a lot, seeing [your monologue],\u201d White said, further discussing an additional pair of reparative surgeries he received after the initial procedure.\n\nWhile his heart could have prevented him from launching his prolific career in athletics, White went on to praise his parents\u2019 decision to push him toward his goals even harder instead of sheltering him because of his malady.\n\n\u201cMy parents are the ones that made me who I am. They didn\u2019t put these limitations on me. [The disease] was obviously explained\u2026 but [they weren\u2019t] hovering over me to make sure I wasn\u2019t getting into trouble or working out too much or doing anything active,\u201d he said (as seen in the video above). \u201cThey really let me find my own limitations, so I feel like that\u2019s why I\u2019m so athletic now.\u201d\n\nThe 30-year-old also revealed he receives regular examinations \u201cevery couple of years\u201d to maintain his health, undergoing stress tests to ensure the functionality of his heart \u2014 an act that\u2019s important now more than ever, as he\u2019s currently training for the 2018 Winter Olympics (with his eye set on competing as a skateboarder in 2020 Summer Olympics).\n\nAt the close of the interview, Kimmel thanked White for sharing his story.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re an inspiration to a lot of families who go through this situation, so thank you. Thanks to your parents, really, for not taking it easy on you,\u201d he said. \u201cIt makes me believe that my son, too, is going to win Olympic gold medals for the United States of America \u2014 only if they make pizza-eating an Olympic event.\u201d\n\nJimmy Kimmel Live airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET on ABC.", "images":
