In fact, several actresses have been candid over the years about challenges that go into awards-show season\u2014namely, finding a designer who works outside of limited sample sizes, which are typically 0 through 4.\n\nMost recently, Bebe Rexha shared that she's having trouble finding designers to dress her for the 2019 Grammy Awards. (She's nominated for Best New Artist and Best Country Duo/Group Performance.) \"I had my team hit out a lot of designers and a lot of them do not want to dress me because I\u2019m too big,\u201d she said in an Instagram video, clarifying that she's a size 8.\n\nIn December, Megan Mullally took to Instagram to share that she couldn't find a designer to dress her for the Screen Actor\u2019s Guild Awards in January\u2014even though she was going to be hosting the entire thing. \u201cLooks like I will be buying my dress online though, as per my usual, even though there is literally a 100 percent chance that I will be on camera, because I\u2019M HOSTING IT,\u201d she wrote in an Instagram post in December. \u201cDesigners do not send me dresses.\u201d\n\nA Wrinkle in Time director Ava DuVernay also spoke out about not finding designers to dress her in a tweet on December 23. \"I\u2019m a director, not an actress. Not a Size 0. I like to stay covered. Stylists weren\u2019t inspired,\" she tweeted.\n\nThey're not alone: Stars like Leslie Jones, Tiffany Haddish, and Rachel Bloom have found themselves in the same boat and have had to purchase their own red-carpet gowns (we're talking $$$, of course) to put together their looks. Below, here are 18 times celebrities got real about the red carpet.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/5c1ec9c0b6bdf52cdb333a92/master/w_1024%2Cc_limit/christina-hendricks-2010-getty.jpg",
