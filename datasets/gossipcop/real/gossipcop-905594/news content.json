I think it's a good thing and I support it.\"\n\nColbert asked Franco if it's possible for there to be reconciliation between his thoughts about what happened and the accusations leveled against him.\n\n\"If there's restitution to be made, I will make it,'' Franco said after a long pause. \"If I've done something wrong, I will fix it. I have to.\"\n\nOn a night when he won a best actor award for his role in \"The Disaster Artist,\" the 39-year-old was called out on Twitter by actresses Violet Paley and Sarah Tither-Kaplan for what they described as sexually inappropriate and exploitative behavior.\n\nAlly Sheedy, the \"Breakfast Club\" star who acted in a 2014 Off-Broadway play directed by Franco, also made cryptic references to Franco on Twitter during the Golden Globes.\n\n\"James Franco just won. Please never ever ask me why I left the film/tv business,\" she wrote in a tweet that has since been deleted.\n\nIn another tweet, the actress wrote, \"Why is James Franco allowed in?\"\n\nFranco told Colbert, \"I have no idea what I did to Ally Sheedy.\"\n\n\"I had nothing but a great time with her. I have total respect for her,\" he added. \"I have no idea why she was upset. She took the tweet down. I can\u2019t speak for her.\"\n\nFranco also reasserted his reason for wearing the pin representing the Time's Up movement in which more than 300 actresses initially donated more than $13 million to a legal defense fund that supports men and women who have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\n\"I wore (the pin) because I do support it,'' Franco said. \"I support change.\"\n\nFollow
