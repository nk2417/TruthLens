Written by Jenni Konner and Lena Dunham and directed beautifully by Nisha Ganatra , it brought the friendship between Hannah (Dunham), Marnie (Allison Williams), Shosh ( Zosia Mamet ) and Jessa ( Jemima Kirke ) to a lovely resting spot at Shosh\u2019s engagement party. Hannah looking at her friends dancing each in their own distinctive ways \u2014 Jessa like nobody was watching, Marnie like everybody was watching and Shosh fixated on a groom-to-be introduced to audiences and Hannah just seconds earlier \u2014 before departing New York City for a job that every think piece posted on the Internet in the past seven days has already told you doesn\u2019t exist in our current academic climate and wouldn\u2019t have gone to Hannah anyway, was a perfect end for the series.\n\nThe previous couple of episodes had also given many of the show\u2019s characters their own effective places of repose. With Shosh as accidental matchmaker, Ray (Alex Karpovsky ) found love, somebody whose idiosyncrasies matched his own. Elijah (Andrew Rannells ) somehow got the lead in the musical of White Men Can\u2019t Jump and maybe he and Dill Harcourt are together. And I guess Adam ends up with Jessa , at least for a while, and even if you think that mercurial relationship isn\u2019t good for the long haul, Adam Driver\u2019s scenes with Dunham/Hannah in the antepenultimate episode were as well-acted as any in the show\u2019s entire run. (I\u2019m glad this season has helped a lot of detractors recognize how good an actress Lena Dunham has become over the six seasons of Girls. This isn\u2019t a Jerry Seinfeld situation. I don\u2019t care if you like or hate Hannah, but Dunham slayed all 10 episodes.)\n\nIf you wanted to sum up the series with Hannah\u2019s half-apology to Jessa , \u201cThink about it. We were all just doing our best,\u201d and Jessa\u2019s reply, \u201cOur best was awful,\u201d that\u2019s a pretty amusing way to do it. Or you can sum the show up in Elijah\u2019s braying laughter between sentences of the declaration, \u201cHannah, you\u2019ve made so many wonderful friendships here. That\u2019s not a thing!\u201d\n\nAll season long, Girls has been sending itself off in the peak of style, delivering one top-notch episode after another. I\u2019m not ready yet to step back and say this was the show\u2019s best season or that any individual episode was the show\u2019s best episode, but in the balance, from Hannah and Paul-Louis in the Hamptons to the Desi nightmare in Poughkeepsie to the Elijah-centric musical audition episode to Hannah\u2019s and Adam\u2019s brief dream reconciliation to the brief and triumphant return of Patrick Wilson\u2019s doctor character, the highlights have been myriad. And that\u2019s without getting to \u201cAmerican Bitch,\u201d the two-hander with Matthew Rhys that probably would get the most Best Episode Yet votes.\n\nLet\u2019s take the nine episodes as a build-up to last week\u2019s finale and then we don\u2019t need to stress about what our expectations were or weren\u2019t for the last installment.\n\nBecause let\u2019s be honest: There wasn\u2019t anything that Girls owed me (or you) in Sunday\u2019s finale. Most of the characters got the send-offs they deserved. There were absolutely no mysteries to be solved or outstanding questions that needed answering or anything that so many Peak TV finales have needed to accomplish when they neared the end. There was no question as to whether Hannah was going to die, whether the CIA was ever going to catch Shosh or whether Adam was going to get that out-of-the-blue phone call from Ron Howard launching his acting career into the stratosphere. Anything you really wanted or deserved from a finale came last week when the four main characters crammed themselves into a bathroom and argued about why they haven\u2019t been good friends to each other for a while.\n\nSunday\u2019s episode, \u201cLatching,\u201d was an epilogue . It was a postscript. It was a \u201cHere\u2019s what life looks like for a little bit until we get around to checking back in on these characters.\u201d\n\nIf you wanted fireworks or epic dramatic outbursts, I\u2019m sure you were disappointed. If you wanted an exceptional and intimate three-hander with Hannah, Marnie and Hannah\u2019s mom Loreen (Becky Ann Baker), plus occasional outbursts by an adorable baby named Grover? Well, if you wanted specifically that exact thing, I\u2019m sure you loved it. This is close enough to what I wanted, personally.\n\nIf last week\u2019s episode did most of the things a good series finale does, \u201cLatching\u201d did probably the one thing last week\u2019s episode didn\u2019t do, specifically tying us back into the pilot.\n\nThe series began, remember, with Hannah\u2019s parents setting Hannah adrift, telling her that she wouldn\u2019t get any more financial support and that she was on her own trying to make it in the big city. It was nothing if not a forcible unlatching from the paternal teat. Sunday\u2019s finale, which Konner directed from a script she co-wrote with Dunham and Judd Apatow \u2026. Well, you don\u2019t need me to explain. Hannah\u2019s neurotic fears that Grover wouldn\u2019t suckle related to Hannah\u2019s ongoing fears about her difficulties being maternal and then, after a marvelous Loreen lecture, Hannah wandering the streets, coming upon a high school girl fleeing from her mother\u2019s protective care and going into maternal overdrive herself. Having ranted at the girl \u2014 \u201cShe\u2019ll take care of you forever, even if it means endless, endless pain\u201d \u2014 Hannah returned home and Grover finally latched as the show eschewed a closing credits song for the sounds of an encouraging mom, a nursing baby and the mumbling singing of a woman with \u201cFast Car\u201d stuck in her head.\n\n\u201cFast Car\u201d was stuck in Hannah\u2019s head because of Marnie\u2019s dogged insistence on singing it in the car and the finale was an unexpectedly big showcase for Marnie . This is good if you\u2019re a fan of Marnie and bad if you\u2019re a Marnie hater and if you\u2019re still a Marnie hater\u2026. Good grief! What\u2019s wrong with you? Last year\u2019s \u201cThe Panic in Central Park\u201d was designed to eliminate the last people not marveling at what a singular portrait of altruistically self-absorbed exceptionalism Williams and the writers have crafted.\n\nIt\u2019s hilarious that while thematically \u201cUnlatched\u201d was one big callback to the pilot, the specific callbacks almost all related to Marnie , introduced in the series just as she was in this episode: spooning in bed with Hannah. As in the pilot, when Marnie\u2019s idea of role-playing was to suggest to Charlie that he try being somebody entirely different from himself, we got to see more of Marnie\u2019s horridness at forced raunch as her isolation in rural New York left her having FaceTime sex with a personal trainer from Weehawken , which included flight attendant/captain dirty talk at its worst (\u201cDo you think I should use the oxygen mask on his dick?\u201d).\n\nMarnie\u2019s abrupt announcement that she wanted to move in with Hannah and help her raise the baby was pretty much vintage Marnie , since we already knew that Marnie lost her apartment and was facing life with her mother. It was pure kindness and pure personal desperation. And her strategy for getting Hannah to give in was also vintage Marnie , starting with, \u201cYou think you have a lot of friends, right?\u201d followed by proof that Hannah\u2019s other friends were all absent, at best.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here. I win. I\u2019m your best friend,\u201d Marie squealed with glee and all Marnie has ever wanted since the pilot is to have Hannah\u2019s undivided best friend attention when she wants/needs it.\n\nMarnie living with Hannah, if only for a few months, was exactly right and then it was also exactly right for her to start wondering about herself again at the end and also to decide that law school might be a good idea because, \u201cI f\u2014 ing love rules.\u201d\n\nYup. That\u2019s our Marnie .\n\nThis was a ideal finale for Girls because taken in the right frame of mind, it offered the heart and humor that marked the show at its best and gave all three actresses many moments to shine. But if you take it in the wrong frame of mind, if you demand that after last week\u2019s closure you get even more closure, it was probably an easy finale to hate and what could be more Girls than that?\n\nSo now let Dunham and Konner and Apatow take a few years to do other things. The Girls Think Piece Industrial Complex will either dry up or move on to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale or Kevin Can Wait or something.\n\nThen it will be time to move this production to the big screen.\n\nGirls on Film, anyone?", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/girls_cropped.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/girls_cropped.jpg?w=2000&h=1126&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/girls_cropped.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Fienberg", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/girls-series-finale-critics-take-994527/", "title": "Critic\u2019s Notebook: \u2018Girls\u2019 Series Finale Offers a Lovely Epilogue", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The penultimate episode wrapped things up for the main quartet, but Hannah and Marnie shined upstate in the finale.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Daniel Fienberg", "tags": "Critic's Notebook, Girls (TV), hbo", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Critic\u2019s Notebook: \u2018Girls\u2019 Series Finale Offers a Lovely Epilogue", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/girls-series-finale-critics-take-994527/", "description": "The penultimate episode wrapped things up for the main quartet, but Hannah and Marnie shined upstate in the finale.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/girls_cropped.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "'Girls' Series Finale Critic's Take"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-04-17T06:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-10T10:49:58+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The penultimate episode wrapped things up for the main quartet, but Hannah and Marnie shined upstate in the finale.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Critic\u2019s Notebook: \u2018Girls\u2019 Series Finale Offers a Lovely Epilogue", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/girls_cropped.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492408800.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
