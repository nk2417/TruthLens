is ready to get down on one knee\n\n'Who would have thought that from their different show backgrounds that they would meet and end up potentially being married,' the source added.\n\nEach of the reality stars have become somewhat known for their turbulent love lives - with Steph known for dating Made In Chelsea bad boy Spencer Matthews, before going through a disastrous break-up with Josh Shepherd on the same show.\n\nJonny was engaged in a will they/won't they romance with Camilla Thurlow during his time on Love Island, only for the couple to call it quits when he turned his
