With the blonde pixie cut reminiscent of her \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d days grown out to reveal her natural brunette roots, Cyrus donned a simple white top and shorts for her debut live performance of the track off her upcoming album. She also tossed bouquets of flowers and shot streams of water into the crowd as large balloons bounced around the stadium.\n\nAfter Cyrus\u2019 little sister, Noah, performed earlier in the day, the siblings brought their mom, Tish, onstage with a tiered birthday cake and had the entire 20,000-member crowd sing \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d to her with the help of Labrinth.\n\nNiall Horan announced his first solo album will be out this fall. One night after he released his latest single, \u201cOn the Loose,\u201d the solo singer said he had just finished recording his album and took to the stage to perform tracks like \u201cThis Town\u201d and \u201cSlow Hands.\u201d While he didn\u2019t perform at the show, fellow former One-Direction bandmate Liam Payne announced an upcoming collaboration with Zedd.\n\nMaroon 5 performed a tribute to Prince by turning the stage lights purple as the band played a cover of the late pop star\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Go Crazy.\u201d In their self-proclaimed \u201c14 thousandth time\u201d appearing at the Wango Tango, the group also played a number of their classic hits, from \u201cHarder to Breathe\u201d and \u201cThis Love\u201d to \u201cSugar\u201d and \u201cMoves Like Jagger.\u201d\n\n\u201cIssues\u201d singer Julia Michaels attended her first Wango Tango as a performer.\n\n\u201cLast year, I came here as a fan and now I\u2019m performing,\u201d the 23-year-old said. \u201cIt\u2019s so bizarre. I never thought this was going to be my life.\u201d\n\nAaron Carter made his comeback performance on the Village stage with his first appearance at the event since 2002. Carter released his latest EP, L\u00f8V\u00eb, in February 2017.\n\n\u201cThe EP was inspired by heartbreak. I was in a relationship with somebody who wasn\u2019t proud of me, was ashamed of me, didn\u2019t want to show me off to the world.\u201d\n\nHe said that initially, record labels were hesitant when he wanted to get back into music.\n\n\u201cEveryone said, \u2018No, Aaron Carter will never make it again\u2019 \u2026So it kind of motivated me to come back out and do my best.\u201d\n\nMachine Gun Kelly brought Hailee Steinfeld back onstage after her own performance for their track, \u201cAt My Best,\u201d while Camila Cabello later made an appearance during his set to perform their hit, \u201cBad Things.\u201d Other collaborations included Zedd and Alessia Cara on their single, \u201cStay,\u201d as well as Noah Cyrus and Labrinth on \u201cMake Me (Cry).\u201d\n\nNow in its 19th year, the music festival easily filled the entire LA Galaxy stadium, but the crowd wasn\u2019t too young to remember the Backstreet Boys, who returned to the Wango Tango stage for the first time since 2001. They closed the show with impressively synchronized dance moves, matching outfits, and hits such as \u201cLarger Than Life\u201d and \u201cEverybody (Backstreet\u2019s Back).\u201d\n\nMain stage artists included Katy Perry, Maroon 5, Niall Horan, Luis Fonsi, Backstreet Boys, Zedd with Alessia Cara, Machine Gun Kelly, Camila Cabello, Hailee Steinfeld, Noah Cyrus, Halsey, Julia Michaels and Miley Cyrus.\n\nPre-show Village artists included Noah Cyrus, Jordan Fisher, Aaron Carter, Olivia Holt, Ocean Park Standoff and Hey Violet.\n\nSee fans\u2019 reactions to the performances below:\n\n#maroon5 nailing yet another Prince song \u2014- #wangotango #kiisfm A post shared by ?\u2014-Kym\u2014-?
