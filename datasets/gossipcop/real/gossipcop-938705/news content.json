During a visit to \u201cEllen\u201d on May 24, Poehler confirmed she\u2019s \u201cabsolutely\u201d on board with the idea of another season of \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d and the comedian even added that she\u2019s certain her co-stars \u201cwould all do\u201d more episodes and return to Pawnee, Indiana.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Poehler said when asked about a potential revival. \u201cI know, I\u2019ll speak for everybody and say we would all do it. I think we\u2019d all do it someday. It would be amazing.\u201d\n\nPoehler was joined on \u201cEllen\u201d by her \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d co-star Nick Offerman, who also expressed interest in stepping back into the shoes of Ron Swanson. \u201cAmy\u2019s the boss of the show,\u201d Offerman said, \u201cso she can speak for everybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cParks and Recreation\u201d ran for seven seasons and 125 episodes between April 2009 and February 2015. The show was never a ratings juggernaut but it was consistently one of the most acclaimed comedies on television. Across its run, the show was nominated twice for the Emmy for Outstanding Comedy Series, while Poehler was nominated four times for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.\n\nOther \u201cParks and Recreation\u201d cast members have gone on record in the past noting their interest in a revival. Aubrey Plaza told Entertainment Tonight at the start of 2018 that she would \u201cdo it,\u201d although she did recommend waiting a bit longer since the show only wrapped three years ago. NBC has had great success reviving shows like \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d while ABC\u2019s \u201cRoseanne\u201d revival was one of the biggest shows on television this spring.", "images": ["https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SPORTICAST__SP_Red_No_Logo_Horiz-002-5.png?resize=232,175", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Claudia-Winkleman-and-Alan-Cumming-1.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7155.jpg?w=3000&h=2656&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TNB_05859_R-H-2024-1.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7417.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-MIssion1-1.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/anaconda.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Beatles-anthology-expanded-REVIEW.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/john-and-yoko.jpg?w=770&h=980&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thoughts-and-prayers-hbo.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Zack-Sharf.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amy-poehler_0.jpg?w=612&h=380&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple_TV_Your_Friends_and_Neighbors_key_art_graphic_header_16_9_show_home.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2246549744.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-01-at-8.32.46\u202fPM.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amy-poehler_0.jpg?w=612", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7173.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-Lowdown-Ethan-Hawke-interview.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amy-poehler_0.jpg?w=612", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zack Sharf"], "canonical_link": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/parks-and-recreation-revival-amy-poehler-confirms-cast-1201968344/", "title": "\u2018Parks and Recreation\u2019 Revival: Amy Poehler Confirms the Cast \u2018Would All Do\u2019 More Episodes", "meta_data": {"description": "Cast members like Nick Offerman and Aubrey Plaza have already expressed interest in bringing the show back for new episodes.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400654071", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Zack Sharf", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Parks and Recreation\u2019 Revival: Amy Poehler Confirms the Cast \u2018Would All Do\u2019 More Episodes", "url": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/parks-and-recreation-revival-amy-poehler-confirms-cast-1201968344/", "description": "Cast members like Nick Offerman and Aubrey Plaza have already expressed interest in bringing the show back for new episodes.", "site_name": "IndieWire", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amy-poehler_0.jpg?w=612", "width": 612, "height": 380, "alt": "\"Parks and Recreation\""}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-25T13:52:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-25T13:53:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Cast members like Nick Offerman and Aubrey Plaza have already expressed interest in bringing the show back for new episodes.", "site": "@IndieWire", "creator": "@zsharf", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Parks and Recreation\u2019 Revival: Amy Poehler Confirms the Cast \u2018Would All Do\u2019 More Episodes", "image": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amy-poehler_0.jpg?w=612"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-iw_favicon.png?w=270", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527256348.0, "source": "https://www.indiewire.com", "summary": ""}
