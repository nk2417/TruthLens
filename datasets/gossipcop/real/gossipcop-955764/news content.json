The new mom opened up to her Twitter followers about why she longed for her first child to be a boy.\n\nRelated: The Kardashian Family: Get to Know the Next Generation While making their mark on the entertainment and business world, the Kardashian-Jenner clan is also raising their next generation. Kourtney Kardashian was the first of Kris Jenner\u2019s children to have kids of her own. Kourtney and her now-ex Scott Disick welcomed their eldest son, Mason, in December 2009, followed by daughter Penelope three years later. [\u2026]\n\nI wanted a boy so badly Because Mason and I are so close. I love our bond. I felt confident in having a boy but God blessed me with my precious True and now I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a boy. True has made me sweeter and more gentle. God gives you what you need. My BFF 4Life \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) July 28, 2018\n\n\u201cI wanted a boy so badly Because Mason and I are so close. I love our bond,\u201d the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star tweeted on Saturday, July 28, referring to sister Kourtney Kardashian\u2018s eldest child. \u201cI felt confident in having a boy but God blessed me with my precious True and now I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a boy. True has made me sweeter and more gentle. God gives you what you need. My BFF 4Life.\u201d\n\nKardashian, 34, noted that True fits in well with the two cousins closest to her in age: Kim Kardashian\u2019s 6-month-old daughter, Chicago, and Kylie Jenner\u2019s 5-month-old little girl, Stormi. \u201cANDDDD she has her two cousins to be her besties,\u201d she added. \u201cWe call them the triplets it\u2019s just the cutest!! GOD IS GREAT.\u201d\n\nRelated: True Thompson\u2019s Baby Album: Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson\u2019s Firstborn Daughter Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian has been a doting mommy ever since her first baby with Tristan Thompson, daughter True, arrived in April 2018. True\u2019s unique name was inspired by Kris Jenner\u2019s grandfather and father. \u201cI sometimes, still can\u2019t believe I\u2019m a mommy!!! True is the sweetest ever. I got my bestie for life! Thank you Jesus for [\u2026]\n\nFans will recall Khlo\u00e9 was disappointed when she learned the sex of her unborn child during a March episode of KUWTK. \u201cI\u2019m really hoping Kylie\u2019s gonna say she\u2019s lying and that I\u2019m really having a boy,\u201d she said after her youngest sister shared the news with her.\n\nMeanwhile, she was completely honest on Saturday when a fan tweeted her to ask if her body bounced back after giving birth to True. \u201cHell no!! Lol i\u2019m still working on it. And it will come in time \u2026 I hope LOL,\u201d she quipped. \u201cBut sitting down I have a completely different stomach then I used to have LOL I really can\u2019t even talk about it.\u201d\n\nWhen put on the spot about whether she thinks about having more children, the Good American founder \u2014 who welcomed her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson in April \u2014 was equally as forthcoming: \u201cNot right now lol True is only 3 months old so give me some time lol.\u201d\n\nRelated: Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson Cheating Scandal: Everything We Know So Far Photos and videos surfaced of Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, allegedly cheating on her with multiple women.
