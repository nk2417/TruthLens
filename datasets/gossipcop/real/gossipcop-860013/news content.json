Do not read until you\u2019ve finished the season.]\n\n\n\nFans of \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201c weren\u2019t the only ones devastated by Poussey Washington\u2019s untimely death in the penultimate episode of season 4.\n\nIn a new Netflix clip posted to YouTube, Samira Wiley, who portrayed the fallen Poussey, tearfully reflected on the death of her beloved character.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the person that gives life to this character but, you know, let\u2019s say I\u2019m pulling myself away from it\u2026 I think it\u2019s going to be devastating,\u201d Wiley said in the video.\n\nWiley also discussed the public\u2019s reaction to Poussey\u2019s fate.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cBecause people are so invested in this show, and some of these things will happen to characters that they have, over the past four years, gotten to know and love, it makes it so personal,\u201d she said.\n\nMatthew Weiner, who directed the episode, expressed Poussey\u2019s impact in an interview last week.\n\n\u201cWe lose this person who is really an innocent, at the hands of an innocent, there\u2019s a double tragedy there,\u201d Weiner said.\n\nDanielle Brooks (Taystee on OITNB and Wiley\u2019s on- and off-screen best friend) discussed the difficulties of filming Poussey\u2019s tragic death.\n\n\u201cI remember talking to [Weiner] and saying, \u2018I have to be honest, I can\u2019t do this over and over again. Yes, I\u2019m trained as an actor, I went to school for this and all of that. But this is not something I can do over and over again,'\u201d Brooks said.\n\nBrooks also took her grief to Twitter in a touching post featuring herself and Wiley.\n\nPoussey\u2019s death is seen as an allegory for the Black Lives Matter movement, as well as the challenges black Americans face on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cAnd now we get to have a voice and say listen, \u2018this is the world that we live in, we\u2019re telling this story for the lost, the last, the least, the left behind, the looked over.\u2019 That\u2019s who we\u2019re telling this story for,\u201d Brooks said.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/orange-is-the-new-black-season-4.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://source.unsplash.com/random/595x333", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/orange-is-the-new-black-season-4.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Arya Roshanian", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/orange-is-the-new-black-death-cast-reacts-season-4-spoiler-dead-1201809344/", "title": "\u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 Cast Reacts to That Shocking Death in Season 4", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The \"Orange Is the New Black\" cast reacted to the dramatic death in season 4 in a new video.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Arya Roshanian", "tags": "Orange Is The New Black", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 Cast Reacts to That Shocking Death in Season 4", "url": "https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/orange-is-the-new-black-death-cast-reacts-season-4-spoiler-dead-1201809344/", "description": "The \"Orange Is the New Black\" cast reacted to the dramatic death in season 4 in a new video.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/orange-is-the-new-black-season-4.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Orange is the New Black Season 4"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-07-06T20:05:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-07-06T20:05:38+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The \"Orange Is the New Black\" cast reacted to the dramatic death in season 4 in a new video.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@aryarosh", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 Cast Reacts to That Shocking Death in Season 4", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/orange-is-the-new-black-season-4.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1467835538.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
