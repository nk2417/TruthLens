And she has no desire to remedy that anytime soon.\n\n\"As a rule, I don't find it helpful to watch myself in anything,\" Lorelai's portrayer confessed to me last month at Deadline's The Contenders Emmy event in Los Angeles (video of which is now available above). \"I will give it a good 10 years and then maybe I'll check it out. As an actor, [whenever] I've watched myself it just makes me feel self-conscious. It doesn't help me do a better job.\" [pmc_inline_gallery]\n\nAlso in the Q&A, Graham and co-star Alexis Bledel shared their markedly divergent opinions about those infamous final four words (the former loved it, the latter loved it less), before weighing in on the subject of a second revival. \"Now it's become what can we [still] do with this story that's satisfying, that [makes it] worth continuing, that will be gratifying to the people who care so much about it,\" Graham said. \"I don't know if there's a need to do more. I would never want it to feel like we overstayed our welcome.\"\n\nPress PLAY above and then hit the comments with your thoughts on Gilmore Girls: Another Year in the Life.", "images": ["https://www.tvline.com/img/TVLine-Icon-RGB-Default-Color.svg", "https://www.tvline.com/img/TVLine-Logo-RGB-Default-Color.svg", "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/awards/gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life-video-lauren-graham-alexis-bledel-832965/gilmore-girls.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/awards/gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life-video-lauren-graham-alexis-bledel-832965/gilmore-girls.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Ausiello"], "canonical_link": "https://www.tvline.com/awards/gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life-video-lauren-graham-alexis-bledel-832965/", "title": "[WATCH] 'Gilmore Girls: Year In The Life': Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "thumbnail": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/awards/gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life-video-lauren-graham-alexis-bledel-832965/gilmore-girls.jpg", "description": "Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\u00a0made its Netflix debut six long months ago and Lauren Graham still has not seen a single frame of&hellip;", "mrf": {"tags": "Content Type:Legacy Article;Primary Category:Netflix;Category:Netflix;Headline Approver:Unknown;Trello Board:Legacy"}, "og": {"site_name": "TVLine", "title": "Gilmore Girls Video: Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel Talk Possibility Of Second Revival, Reflect On Baby Twist - TVLine", "image": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/awards/gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life-video-lauren-graham-alexis-bledel-832965/gilmore-girls.jpg", "description": "Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\u00a0made its Netflix debut six long months ago and Lauren Graham still has not seen a single frame of&hellip;", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.tvline.com/awards/gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life-video-lauren-graham-alexis-bledel-832965/"}, "twitter": {"title": "Gilmore Girls Video: Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel Talk Possibility Of Second Revival, Reflect On Baby Twist - TVLine", "description": "Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\u00a0made its Netflix debut six long months ago and Lauren Graham still has not seen a single frame of&hellip;", "site": "@TVLine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/awards/gilmore-girls-a-year-in-the-life-video-lauren-graham-alexis-bledel-832965/gilmore-girls.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-22T20:47:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-05-22T20:47:28+00:00", "author": "Michael Ausiello"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495425600.0, "source": "https://tvline.com", "summary": ""}
