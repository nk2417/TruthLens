She also battled bouts of drug induced psychosis and dementia.\n\n\u201cI was hallucinating on a daily basis. It took a year after getting after that drug for the chemicals in my brain to settle so that I stopped seeing things,\u201d the 42-year-old told the U.K.\u2019s iNews in an interview published on Thursday, December 7. \u201cI\u2019d just be sitting there, seeing a random bee or bunny.\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrities Who Have Been to Rehab The perils of fame: struggling with painful pasts, overnight success and other demons, countless A-listers -- from former child stars like Lindsay Lohan to Oscar winners like Robert Downey Jr. -- have sought help at rehab.

I remember thinking: \u2018If I walk outside, and the SWAT team\u2019s out there, I was right all along. But if they\u2019re not out there, then it\u2019s the drugs making me see things and I\u2019m going to end up in an institution.
