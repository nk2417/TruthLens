From the time I met him last year in Mexico I thought to myself he is hot \u2013 and would make such a good husband from all the good energy I felt from his heart. I didn\u2019t think much more of it because I lived in San Diego and he lived in Nashville,\u201d wrote the esthetician, who vied for Chris Soules\u2019 heart on season 19 of The Bachelor in 2015 before appearing on season 2 of Bachelor in Paradise later that year.\n\n\u201cLittle did I know he was going to come visit me and little did I know I would feel sick to my stomach when he left to go back home. I knew I hadn\u2019t felt that special or that close to someone in pretty much ever, and had no idea how it would work out,\u201d she continued. \u201cI am so happy that our relationship not only developed so much over the next couple months, but flourished.\u201d\n\nRelated: The Bachelor\u2019s Broken Engagements, Weddings, Babies and More!

WE ARE ENGAGED!!!!!!\u201d she gushed. \u201cHe is the best man I could ask for and my best friend\u2026 not to mention he makes me laugh till my stomach hurts every morning and every day. I never would have expected we would have met like we did but I am so freaking grateful that we did. I love you @theaaronbass!! Thank you for making me the luckiest girl in the world!!\u201d\n\nRelated: Celebrity Engagement Rings of 2018 Let it be stated that 2018 thus far has been a major year for celebrity engagements. The only thing more major than the couples deciding to head down the aisle? The rings. From Emily Ratajkowski\u2019s super unique two-stone sparkler to the elegant oval-cut stone that Hailey Baldwin received from Justin Bieber, these rings are hard [\u2026]\n\nEvan \u2014 whose wife, Carly Waddell, also competed on Soules\u2019 season \u2014 later congratulated his brother and future sister-in-law on their engagement. \u201cSo so happy for my brother getting engaged to this incredible woman,\u201d the 35-year-old tweeted. \u201cThese 2 snuck away to the beach after meeting at our wedding and then a little over a year later they sneak back to Mexico to get engaged!!
