Because of the success of the first season [of Stranger Things], I just kind of wanted to make a bit of a splash with the Duffers, because I assumed they would be getting so many tapes. I had the audition details for about a day, and I did the whole thing in the first day because I was so overwhelmingly excited about it. I got [the audition details] when I woke up, so that's 7 o'clock. It was one scene, the scene of me and Max in the car, and there was a scene from Stand By Me.\n\nSo I got up, kinda went crazy, shaved all my hair off around my face except for my mustache, and then rang two friends who are still studying at the acting university that I went to here in Perth. I was like, Can you help read for me behind the camera tonight? Then during the day I made everything else happen\u2014the dancing and the rest, going out in the G-string and just playing around with it, and putting it together on iMovie and doing all that sort of stuff. And then my two friends came around in the evening, and they had no idea.\n\nWhat was their reaction?\n\nWell, I did the scenes with them, and they didn't have any idea that I'd been doing all this stuff during the day. So when I did send them the tape afterwards, they were like, what the hell were you doing the whole day before we came over?\n\nI always just like to improvise, and that goes for my audition tapes as well. I kind of play around with it, have fun with it. Obviously in the audition tape, you can see that I'm holding my iPhone because I'm playing music as I'm going, and it's kind of a bit like a theater piece for me sometimes. I'll just speak and dance and go crazy and, you know, turn the music up as the audition tape goes on, and just leave the camera rolling.\n\nWhat did the Duffer brothers say about the audition tape?\n\n[laughs] I love it because they're so casual. I sent off the tape at 11 o'clock that night, Australian time. And then in the morning we had a response saying, the Duffers want to Skype you on Sunday. They were kind of like, \"Hey man. So we saw your tape, and, you know, it caused a bit of a stir at Netflix.\" Apparently it was played in the big board meeting.", "images": ["https://media.gq.com/photos/59fb29e763a4417750d3d6a7/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/dacre-montgomery-stranger-things-2.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6916928260d328606a06ec5f/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/59fb29e763a4417750d3d6a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dacre-montgomery-stranger-things-2.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6916aa75ea366cd8560f5749/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/6917a602344e3b09451b19b3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/691c9953db523f8efa81b00b/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/67ffe2862295e291fb2f11c3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/67e2e7a7319c00fc4a9eb1f5/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/57bb5af37c4c5fcf03df63ec/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/691b99d8ae69092d9a6ffaaf/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/66f58bface92479a317dfcd3/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/59f10cc5f64b735d7390bcb1/1:1/w_775%2Cc_limit/joe-keery-aaron-feaver-9-2.jpg", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/asset-tentpole-moty.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/68c88de476e8da9f4a84b640/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/651b027b39a3e772eeea0a81/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/68f69dd0114bd501a60952fc/1:1/w_640%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo.svg", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq-global/assets/logo-reverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.gq.com/photos/59fb29e763a4417750d3d6a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dacre-montgomery-stranger-things-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Luisa Rollenhagen", "Scott Meslow"], "canonical_link": "https://www.gq.com/story/dacre-montgomery-stranger-things-audition-tape", "title": "Witness Dacre Montgomery's Wild, Shirtless Audition Tape for Stranger Things 2", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Luisa Rollenhagen", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Montgomery, who plays Hawkins' new resident bully Billy, was quite determined to make an impression.", "id": "59fafb865e433c3c2c6963a5", "robots": "index, follow, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59fafb865e433c3c2c6963a5", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Montgomery, who plays Hawkins' new resident bully Billy, was quite determined to make an impression.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/59fb29e763a4417750d3d6a7/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/dacre-montgomery-stranger-things-2.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/59fb29e763a4417750d3d6a7/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/dacre-montgomery-stranger-things-2.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Dacre Montgomery, who plays Hawkins' new resident bully, was quite determined to make an impression.", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/59fb29e763a4417750d3d6a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dacre-montgomery-stranger-things-2.jpg", "site_name": "GQ", "title": "Witness the Wild, Shirtless Audition Tape of Billy from 'Stranger Things'", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gq.com/story/dacre-montgomery-stranger-things-audition-tape"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-11-02T17:20:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-02T17:20:00.000Z", "author": "Luisa Rollenhagen"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@gqmagazine", "description": "Dacre Montgomery, who plays Hawkins' new resident bully, was quite determined to make an impression.", "domain": "https://www.gq.com", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/59fb29e763a4417750d3d6a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/dacre-montgomery-stranger-things-2.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@gqmagazine", "title": "Witness the Wild, Shirtless Audition Tape of Billy from 'Stranger Things'"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/59fb29e763a4417750d3d6a7/2:3/w_1000,h_1500,c_limit/dacre-montgomery-stranger-things-2.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 606963029328755, "pages": 7962048097}, "google": "nopagereadaloud"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509643200.0, "source": "https://www.gq.com", "summary": ""}
