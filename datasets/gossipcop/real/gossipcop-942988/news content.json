The \"Parts Unknown\" host's net worth had previously been estimated at around $16 million.\n\nThe papers filed in Manhattan Surrogate's Court showed that Bourdain had $425,000 in \"cash and savings,\" $35,000 in a brokerage account, $250,000 in \"personal property,\" and $500,000 in \"intangible property including royalties and residuals.\"\n\nThe will reportedly states that Bourdain's 11-year-old daughter, Ariane Busia-Bourdain, will receive the majority of his fortune. Ariane's mother and Bourdain's ex-wife Ottavia Busia is the executor of his estate.\n\nSince his divorce with Busia was never formalized, she is legally still his next of kin. Bourdain reportedly left Busia his air miles, which he asks her in the will to \"dispose of in accordance with what [she] believes to have been my wishes.\"\n\nBut in addition to the $1.21 million of assets designated in his will, Bourdain also kept an undisclosed sum in a private trust, according to documents obtained by TMZ.\n\nIt's not clear who will inherit the funds in the trust, or how much there is to inherit, but it's common for wealthy people to create trusts to protect their privacy and for tax management.\n\nAnthony Bourdain and ex-wife Ottavia Busia. Evan Agostini/Invision/AP\n\nPeople reports that the court will appoint a guardian to protect Ariane's interests in her father's estate because she is a minor.\n\nThe celebrity chef's New York condo, which was reported to be worth $3.35 million when he bought it in 2014, was not included in the will, but the filings indicate a $1 million mortgage liability for an unspecified property.\n\n\"I own an apartment with a mortgage that my ex-wife and my daughter live in, and I'm a renter. I should always be a renter,\" Bourdain told PEOPLE in February. \"I regret buying that apartment. The bank owns it, and then you're stuck with it.\"\n\nThe will was apparently written in 2016 before his split with then-wife Busia. Bourdain was dating actress and activist Asia Argento at the time of his death by suicide.\n\nBourdain was in France working on Season 12 of \"Parts Unknown\" when he was discovered dead in his hotel room.", "images": ["https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/stacked-black.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/MI/logos/markets-insider-stacked.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/logos/placeholder.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/news-insider.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5b3f3430c8d6ed38008b4623?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5b1a7cad42e1cc55a53d18e4?width=700", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/silicon-alley-insider.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=9900186&cv=3.6.0&;cj=1&comscorekw=", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-media.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5b3f3430c8d6ed38008b4623?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacob Shamsian", "Tom Murray"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/anthony-bourdains-will-reveals-he-was-worth-just-12-million-2018-7", "title": "Anthony Bourdain's will reveals he was worth $1.2 million \u2014 much less than previous estimates", "meta_data": {"version": "251119.1211", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Anthony Bourdain's will reveals he was worth $1.2 million \u2014 much less than previous estimates", "datePublished": "2018-07-06T09:54:14.000Z", "dateModified": "2018-07-06T17:29:17.000Z", "news_keywords": "Travel, CNN, Chef, Death, Suicide", "description": "According to court papers, Bourdain's assets amount to $1.21 million.
