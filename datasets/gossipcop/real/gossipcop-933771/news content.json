She compared the tumors\u2019 sizes to two apples, three kiwis and a few strawberries \u2014 \u201ca fruit bowl of pain everyday,\u201d she wrote \u2014 and added that the weight and size of the growths was proportional to being six months pregnant.\n\n\u201cI tried to be brave but it was excruciating at times and to be honest I started to doubt if my body would ever feel the same again,\u201d she shared. \u201cI had surgery in December and I was so scared, despite lots of love from friends and family I felt really alone and my confidence as a woman was knocked.\u201d\n\nFKA twigs, who split from fianc\u00e9 Robert Pattinson last year, said she struggled with the decision to come forward about her battle. However, a dance session sparked her confidence.\n\n\u201cToday whilst dancing with Kelly at the choreography house I felt like my strong self again for the first time in a while and it was magical,\u201d she captioned the black and white video of her doing a pole dancing routine. \u201cThank you precious body for healing, thank you for reminding me to be kind to myself, you are a wonderful thing, now go create and be other once again <3.\u201d\n\nThe 30-year-old then shared a message to others dealing with similar health scares.\n\n\u201cI know that a lot of women suffer from fibroid tumours and I just wanted to say after my experience that you are amazing warriors and that you are not alone. you can get through this,\u201d she said, signing off on her post, \u201cand with this I let go of the pain\u2026 love always twigs.\u201d\n\nMatt Crossick/PA Images/Getty\n\nUterine fibroids are benign tumors that most commonly occur between ages 30 and 40, with black women being most highly affected.\n\n\u201cThere is virtually no threat of malignancy \u2014 and there are a number of excellent treatment options, as well as the option to do nothing at all \u2014 so there really is no reason to worry,\u201d Steve Goldstein, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at NYU Medical Center, told WebMD.\n\nAlthough most women with the condition have no symptoms, they can cause abdominal pain or uterine bleeding, Dr. Aydin Arici, director of reproductive endocrinology and infertility at the Yale University School of Medicine, told WebMD. In some cases, the tumors could cause infertility or pregnancy loss.\n\nFKA twigs got plenty of support from her fans, as well as a few celebrity pals.\n\n\u201cAmazing!!\u201d Jenna Dewan commented on the video. \u201cSending you so much love and healing.\u201d\n\nPerez Hilton added, \u201cThank you for sharing! You are a superwoman!!!\u201d", "images":
