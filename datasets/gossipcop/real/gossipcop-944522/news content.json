News,\u201d the cable network announced Friday.\n\n\u201cGiuliana is an incredibly charismatic and well-respected entertainment journalist. As a longtime member of the E! family, it\u2019s exciting to welcome her back home to \u2018E! News,\u2019\u201d said John Najarian, executive vice president and general manager of news and digital for E!. \u201cWhile \u2018E! News\u2019 has seen massive growth across digital and social, we have also continued to expand and elevate our television coverage, and Giuliana is an excellent addition to our weeknight series, which remains the most watched entertainment news franchise with young women.\u201d\n\nRancic was previously the co-host of the nigtly entertainment news show from 2005-2015. She will return to the show on Sept. 4, where she will join co-host Jason Kennedy. Most recently, Rancic was part of E!\u2019s coverage of the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and has also covered red carpets and other special events for the network. She will continue as co-host of E!\u2019s \u201cLive From the Red Carpet\u201d after her return to \u201cE! News.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\n\u201cReturning to host \u2018E! News\u2019 is every bit as thrilling to me today as it was 16 years ago when I joined the show and embarked on this wonderful career,\u201d said Rancic. \u201cCo-hosting alongside one of my best friends, Jason Kennedy, with one of the most talented teams in entertainment journalism, makes this move even more special. I can\u2019t wait to reconnect with the \u2018E! News\u2019 audience and go on this journey together once again.\u201d\n\nRancic\u2019s return comes after the departure of Maria Menounos last summer. But more recently, E! host Catt Sadler departed after she says she learned of a substantial pay gap between herself and Kennedy. E! disputed Sadler\u2019s claims, saying that she and Kennedy had \u201cdifferent roles,\u201d with Sadler focused on daytime while Kennedy worked in primetime and did red carpet coverage.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/giuliana-rancic-grammys.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C700px%2C394px&resize=1000%2C563", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/giuliana-rancic-grammys.jpg?w=700&h=667&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/giuliana-rancic-grammys.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C700px%2C394px&resize=1000%2C563", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Otterson", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/giuliana-rancic-e-news-return-1202848122/", "title": "Giuliana Rancic to Return to \u2018E!
