Relationships come and go but friendship is always there,\" she explains.\n\nMarie Claire UK/ David Roemer\n\nIt's no surprise that Turner and Williams have become such good friends. The actresses have spent nearly half their lives playing Sansa and Arya Stark, respectively.\n\n\"[Game of Thrones] has been a huge chunk of my life,\" Turner admits.\"When it's done, it's going to feel like a death in the family. I just completely gave everything to [playing Sansa Stark], all of my emotions. I never used to cry when I was younger. Now I cry all the time -- I am an emotional human being.\"\n\n\n\nWATCH: Maisie Williams Wishes Sophie Turner a Happy 21st Birthday With Amazing Throwback Snap -- See the Pic!\n\n\"There was a period in my life when I was 14/15, and I was like, 'I want to be seen as a real actress -- I can't f**k around. This is my career,'\" she says. \"Now I'm like, 'Just enjoy it,' the painful part is finding another job. There's a certain sense when you're 15 and you're just kind of like, a pawn, and you'll say, 'Yeah, I will do what you want,' but now I'm like, 'You know, actually I don't like this.'\"\n\nTurner's X-Men co-star, Jennifer Lawrence, seems to have rubbed off on her.\n\n\"She would do a take and be like, 'Cut! That was such bad acting!'\" Turner recalls. \"Her being able to stop [the scene]; it was inspiring to see someone so in control.\"\n\n\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Watch Sophie Turner's Emotional Audition for 'X-Men: Apocalypse'", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_sophie_turner_marie_claire.jpg", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_sophie_turner_marie_claire.jpg?width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_sophie_turner_marie_claire.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220989_sophie_turner_opens_up_about_dating_joe_jonas_you_feel_like_you_re_living_a_fishbowl", "title": "Sophie Turner Opens Up About Dating Joe Jonas: 'You Feel Like You're Living in a Fishbowl'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_sophie_turner_marie_claire.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The actress also dishes on the final seasons of 'Game of Thrones' and what she learned from Jennifer Lawrence.", "title": "Sophie Turner Opens Up About Dating Joe Jonas: 'You Feel Like You're Living in a Fishbowl'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220989_sophie_turner_opens_up_about_dating_joe_jonas_you_feel_like_you_re_living_a_fishbowl", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The actress also dishes on the final seasons of 'Game of Thrones' and what she learned from Jennifer Lawrence.", "twitter": {"description": "The actress also dishes on the final seasons of 'Game of Thrones' and what she learned from Jennifer Lawrence.", "title": "Sophie Turner Opens Up About Dating Joe Jonas: 'You Feel Like You're Living in a Fishbowl'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/220989_sophie_turner_opens_up_about_dating_joe_jonas_you_feel_like_you_re_living_a_fishbowl", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_sophie_turner_marie_claire.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Sophie Turner Opens Up About Dating Joe Jonas: 'You Feel Like You're Living in a Fishbowl' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Joe Jonas, Game Of Thrones", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
