She's so incredibly happy.\"\n\n\"They're personalities are very similar,\" the source continues. \"They\u2019re both outgoing, fun, and goofy. He really makes her a better version of herself.\"\n\nWhile the source didn't reveal the name of Grimaldi's new beau, they told us he is originally from Montreal and serves in the army.\n\n\"They\u2019re the perfect match for each other because they have very similar values,\" the source tells ET. \"They both come from close-knit families and they're both very philanthropic. They've met each other's families and enjoy spending time with them often.\"\n\nGrimaldi first revealed the news that she was dating again while chatting with Bachelor Winter Games alum Dean Unglert on his podcast, Help! I Suck at Dating, according to People\n\n\"I always wanted to find someone \u2026 who\u2019s gonna be a great father, someone who's gonna be a great husband, someone who's family-oriented,\" the 30-year-old reality star shared. \"I wanted all those things, but the people that I was dating either had some of it but they didn't have all of it.\"\n\n\"I don't care if you have a million followers,\" she continued. \"I don't care. I'd rather you not have Instagram. I'd rather you not know I was ever on the show.\"\n\nWhile chatting with Unglert, Grimaldi also confirmed her mystery man is not involved with the \"Bachelor world\" in any way.\n\n\"I don't know where this is going to lead, but I do know I appreciate all his qualities,\" she gushed. \"I feel like I'm a much better person when I'm with him. I'm just very lighthearted, and I'm focused on the right things and I'm not distracted by the fake world that we could be a part of.\"\n\nThough Grimaldi and Viall ended their engagement last August, they have remained on good terms and continue to support each other. Grimaldi opened up about the split while chatting with ET in December 2017.\n\n\"The breakup wasn't easy, but it was important for me still to have a good relationship with him after we broke up,\" she explained. \"That was an important thing for the both of us and we both very much support each other.\"\n\n\"[We talk] every once in a while,\" she added. \"I have a lot of respect for Nick.\"\n\nHear more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_120417_VanessaNickViall720.png?h=94f212bc&width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-08/nick-viall4.jpg?h=43c782b3&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-12/vanessa1_0.jpg?h=2ce5f7dd&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/gettyimages-884132166.jpg?h=5998966f", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2024-04/mk-Gerry-Turner-and-Theresa-Nist-2-1920-x-800-GALLERY-HERO-TEAR.jpg?h=0a35da97&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/gettyimages-884132166.jpg?h=5998966f", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/bachelor-star-vanessa-grimaldi-has-been-dating-new-boyfriend-for-a-few-months-following-nick-viall", "title": "'Bachelor' Star Vanessa Grimaldi Has Been Dating New Boyfriend for 'a Few Months' Following Nick Viall Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/gettyimages-884132166.jpg?h=5998966f", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "A source tells ET the reality star is 'so incredibly happy.'", "title": "'Bachelor' Star Vanessa Grimaldi Has Been Dating New Boyfriend for 'a Few Months' Following Nick Viall Split", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/bachelor-star-vanessa-grimaldi-has-been-dating-new-boyfriend-for-a-few-months-following-nick-viall", "type": "Article"}, "description": "A source tells ET the reality star is 'so incredibly happy.'", "twitter": {"description": "A source tells ET the reality star is 'so incredibly happy.'", "title": "'Bachelor' Star Vanessa Grimaldi Has Been Dating New Boyfriend for 'a Few Months' Following Nick Viall Split", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/bachelor-star-vanessa-grimaldi-has-been-dating-new-boyfriend-for-a-few-months-following-nick-viall", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-04/gettyimages-884132166.jpg?h=5998966f", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "'Bachelor' Star Vanessa Grimaldi Has Been Dating New Boyfriend for 'a Few Months' Following Nick Viall Split | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, News, Vanessa Grimaldi, The Bachelor, Nick Viall", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
