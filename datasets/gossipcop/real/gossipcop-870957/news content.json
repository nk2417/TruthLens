This is, after all, the woman who dressed Ruth Negga in that impeccable Valentino for the \u2019 , her love of Instagram, and what she\u2019s working on next.\n\n\n\nOne may assume it was the room service iced coffee that had Karla Welch jumping on the bed when we photographed her in New York City (fresh off a red-eye from L.A., no less), but having chatted with the powerhouse stylist, we think it was the high from having just launched her Hanes x karla line that was responsible. \u201cI haven\u2019t had enough time to properly reflect on it, but I\u2019m really proud,\u201d Welch said between takes. And for good reason. Inspired by the longline white tee she designed with Hanes for Justin Bieber\u2014a signature piece during the Believe tour and a wardrobe staple of Bieber\u2019s ever since\u2014the seven-shirt collection includes classic, cropped, and sleeveless styles, and is already being worn by Zendaya Karlie Kloss , and Tracee Ellis Ross , among a slew of Welch\u2019s other celeb clients. Oh, and did we mention the campaign? Starring Bieber, Kaia Gerber , and Joan Smalls , it was a literal labor of love shot by Welch\u2019s husband, Matthew. \u201c[We] worked together the whole process, and I was so grateful to him,\u201d Welch says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait for everyone to see the images.\u201dHere at Coveteur HQ, we couldn\u2019t wait to see how Welch would style her shirts. This is, after all, the woman who dressed Ruth Negga in that impeccable Valentino for the Oscars , put Sarah Paulson in plunging custom Prada at the Emmys, and landed at number one on The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s 25 Most Powerful Stylists in Hollywood list\u2014so yes, we were taking notes. Our afternoon was a deep dive into optimal white-tee dressing, but also one that included talk of Welch\u2019s former career as a ma\u00eetre d, her love of Instagram, and what she\u2019s working on next.\n\nHer thoughts on her Hollywood Reporter nod:\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m super pragmatic, so I was like, \u2018OK, great!... Now I have a job to prep.\u2019 But I\u2019m super proud of the year that I\u2019ve had, and the [Hollywood Reporter party] was such a fun night because I got to be with all of my peers. There\u2019s a group of us that are really close. We\u2019re competitive because you want to get the girl or the job, but there\u2019s so much room for everyone, so it was just a great celebration.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe best part about her job:\n\n\n\n\u201cI love fashion, and I think designers are artists \u2014 I know they are. To be able to work closely and develop relationships with Pierpaolo [Piccioli] or Nicholas [Ghesqui\u00e8re], and to have a dress made for a client\u2014I\u2019ll never get over it. I make sure my girls understand how baller and special it is, and to not ever take it for granted. I think that my favorite part of the job is that I get to be a conduit for designers\u2014to make sure [my work] is how they envision their look to be.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat her personal white tee collection looks like:\n\n\n\n\u201cI fully cleaned out my closet, and I only own my own white tees now! But I probably had like, 50 before. And they were all trash, but I kept holding on to them. So now I have two of each of mine to start.\u201d\n\n\n\nHow Hanes x Karla came about:\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen I created xKarla, the idea was that I didn\u2019t want to wait for a brand to come to me and say, \u2018Hey, do you want to be an ambassador?\u2019 I feel like it\u2019s a new way to collaborate where I say, \u2018I want to make this, I\u2019m going to find someone who it makes sense for me to make it with.\u2019 So that\u2019s what this is.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer tips on caring for a Hanes x Karla tee:\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so hard with [mine]. I just wear them, wear them, wear them. If it\u2019s not dirty, I\u2019m not going to wash it, so I don\u2019t wash after every wear. I think you should wear stuff and let it bag out a bit. And then machine-wash. Sometimes I air-dry, sometimes I just throw [them] in the dryer. They\u2019re tough. You can beat these ones up.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat she learned from working in the service industry:\n\n\n\n\u201cI was a ma \u00ee tre d \u2019 and a sommelier at a restaurant in Vancouver, and I loved it. I think you meet someone and you know they\u2019ve been a waiter or a server. There\u2019s something that makes you a better person, and you just have a better understanding of things. Service is important.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhy she loves social media:\n\n\n\n\u201cI love teasing my husband because for the longest time he told me, \u2018You need to be on Instagram.\u2019 I was late to it, but now I love Instagram so much that he\u2019s always telling me to put my phone down. It\u2019s fun to share. Especially for me, because I\u2019m an introvert, but I\u2019m an extroverted introvert, and there is such a thing as that. It\u2019s this amazing way to [talk] to people who I\u2019d probably be too shy to say hi to. For better or worse, online is very much where our community is, and that\u2019s how we get our news and connect with other people.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy she\u2019s vocal about her political beliefs:\n\n\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s so unfortunate and not thoughtful when people think that someone has to just be one way. We\u2019re all humans. Why should thoughts on politics be limited to politicians? Please\u2014that\u2019s half the problem we\u2019re in right now. I\u2019ve never felt like I shouldn\u2019t be able to speak up. I\u2019ve always been a voice, and I\u2019m never going to stop because I have a brand or because I have followers. I want my followers to know what I believe in, and if I can educate or shed some light on things that are important to me, than that\u2019s a good reason I would use my forum. I think what\u2019s going on in the world is crazy and wrong, and if we don\u2019t use our voices, we\u2019re screwed.\u201d\n\n\n\nHer next move:\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have another drop coming in Japan, so stay tuned. It\u2019s going to be another Hanes thing\u2014it\u2019s going to be something awesome.\u201d\n\n\n\nClick through to see how Welch styles four of her Hanes x Karla shirts.", "images": ["https://coveteur.com/media-library/coveteur-logo.png?id=58367331&width=1000&height=419", "https://coveteur.com/media-library/image.gif?id=25354336&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C22%2C0%2C23", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 600 600'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1333 2000'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://coveteur.com/media-library/image.gif?id=25354336&width=1245&height=700&quality=90&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C0", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=39712200&cv=3.9.1&cj=1", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-FMBaK2acGSG7d.gif", "https://coveteur.com/media-library/coveteur-loog.png?id=58244195&width=1000&height=419", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 2000 1333'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://coveteur.com/media-library/image.gif?id=25354336&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C22%2C0%2C23", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leah Faye Cooper"], "canonical_link": "https://coveteur.com/2018/05/28/karla-welch-white-tee-styling-tips-justin-bieber-stylist/", "title": "Hollywood\u2019s Most Powerful Stylist Shows Us How to Wear a White Tee", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 200167090048537}, "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@Coveteur", "id": 228379737}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://coveteur.com/media-library/image.gif?id=25354336&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C22%2C0%2C23"}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://coveteur.com/2018/05/28/karla-welch-white-tee-styling-tips-justin-bieber-stylist/", "site_name": "Coveteur", "image": {"identifier": "https://assets.rbl.ms/61498606/origin.png", "width": "1200px", "height": "630px"}, "title": "Hollywood\u2019s Most Powerful Stylist Shows Us How to Wear a White Tee", "description": "Karla Welch on fashion, politics, and how to wear a white tee."}, "description": "Karla Welch on fashion, politics, and how to wear a white tee.", "keywords": "NSFW-dpv, NSFW", "referrer": "always", "theme-color": "#647187", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1.0", "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-28T12:00:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-11-10T17:50:29+00:00"}, "am-api-token": "XXOcb2hmBumn"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527480000.0, "source": "http://coveteur.com", "summary": ""}
