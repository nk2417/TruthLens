For the first time ever, the two stars will take the stage together to open the awards show. Both women will also have their own solo spotlight performances during the event, with Pink playing the title track from her Beautiful Trauma album and Clarkson taking on a song from her Meaning of Life release and a surprise fan favorite.\n\nExplore Kelly Clarkson Pink See latest videos, charts and news\n\nEarlier this month, Clarkson expressed wanting to collaborate with Pink at some point in a conversation with EW editor-in-chief Henry Goldblatt at one of the magazine\u2019s A-List events. \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of Pink,\u201d Clarkson said, \u201cI haven\u2019t had the chance yet to work with her. I think if you project it enough, it might happen, right?\u201d Looks like she was right.\n\nClarkson went on to gush over Pink\u2019s latest album Beautiful Trauma, \u201cI love her because she has done the whole singer-songwriter record she recently did, she does pop, she loves rock.\u201d Clarkson also added that she loves Pink\u2019s unapologetic nature, that, \u201cShe is who she is, and that\u2019s cool if you like her, and it\u2019s cool if you don\u2019t. I relate to that, so I think that\u2019s why I like her a lot.\u201d\n\nIt had been previously announced that both performers would appear on the AMAs as performers, but until now it was not known that the two would collaborate for the first time. Among the other incredible performances promised by the AMAs are a rare appearance from Diana Ross, Christina Aguilera\u2018s Bodyguard tribute, BTS\u2018 AMAs debut, and many more.\n\nVote for the AMAs on Billboard.com.\n\nThe 2017 American Music Awards will broadcast live from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Sunday, Nov. 19 at 8 p.m. EST on ABC.", "images": ["http://static.billboard.com/files/media/amas-2-recirc-2017.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/04-pink-vma-performance-aa-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/04-pink-vma-performance-aa-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Allison Stubblebine", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/amas-2017-kelly-clarkson-pink-performance-opener-8039118/", "title": "Kelly Clarkson & P!nk To Team Up For Exciting Performance for 2017 AMAs Opener", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Kelly Clarkson and Pink will perform together for the first time at the 2017 AMAs.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Allison Stubblebine", "tags": "ama", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kelly Clarkson & P!nk To Team Up For Exciting Performance for 2017 AMAs Opener", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/amas-2017-kelly-clarkson-pink-performance-opener-8039118/", "description": "Kelly Clarkson and Pink will perform together for the first time at the 2017 AMAs.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/04-pink-vma-performance-aa-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "P!nk"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-16T14:58:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-16T21:52:02+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kelly Clarkson and Pink will perform together for the first time at the 2017 AMAs.", "site": "@billboard", "creator": "@MsAllyMackenzie", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kelly Clarkson & P!nk To Team Up For Exciting Performance for 2017 AMAs Opener", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/04-pink-vma-performance-aa-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510844287.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
