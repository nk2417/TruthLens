The Grown-ish actress described the recovery as \"hard.\"\n\nShe said, \"I didn't want to eat, I didn't want to drink anything. Selena did have a complication, too. A few hours after our surgery, I woke up and had a text from her that said, \u2018I'm really scared. My kidney was very active, and when it turned I broke an artery.'\n\nRaisa said they had her go into emergency surgery \"to get a vein from her leg and build a new artery\" so that the kidney would stay in place.\n\n\"She could have died,\" Raisa said.\n\nFollowing their surgeries, Gomez posted a photo of she and Raisa together explaining what had been going on with her health.\n\nGomez first discussed her lupus publicly in 2015 after flying under the radar to focus on healing.\n\n\u201cI was diagnosed with [autoimmune disease] lupus, and I\u2019ve been through chemotherapy,\" she told Billboard. \"That\u2019s what my break was really about. I could\u2019ve had a stroke.\u201d\n\nSince her transplant, Gomez has been back working on season two of 13 Reasons Why and on her next album.\n\nIn February, it was confirmed she had been in a treatment facility for anxiety and depression.\n\nHopefully Gomez continues putting her health first.", "images": ["https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/20/10/selena-gomez.jpg", "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/20/10/selena-gomez.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/20/10/selena-gomez.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/selena-gomez-francia-raisa-justin-bieber-kidney-donor-singer-almost-died-transplant-a8248291.html", "title": "Selena Gomez's kidney donor Francia Raisa says singer almost died after transplant", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/music/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "There was a complication", "og": {"updated_time": "2018-03-09T17:00:42.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Selena Gomez almost died after her kidney transplant", "url": "https://www.the-independent.com/arts-entertainment/music/news/selena-gomez-francia-raisa-justin-bieber-kidney-donor-singer-almost-died-transplant-a8248291.html", "type": "article", "description": "There was a complication", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/20/10/selena-gomez.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/20/10/selena-gomez.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-09T17:00:42.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-09T17:00:42.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Music", "author_name": "Ilana Kaplan", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 340, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 2, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 0, "external_link_count": 2}, "date": "2018-03-09T17:00:42.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Selena Gomez almost died after her kidney transplant", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "There was a complication", "image": "https://static.the-independent.com/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/11/20/10/selena-gomez.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Selena Gomez\",\"Justin Bieber\",\"Kidney transplant\",\"Death\",\"Surgery\",\"lupus\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520614842.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
