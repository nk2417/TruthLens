While the event is a multi-day music festival, it is also a huge draw for the many private parties and events and, of course, PEOPLE was behind the scenes with the stars.\n\nRead on for the best moments from the parties.\n\nThursday, April 13\n\nAlessandra Ambrosio sure knows how to get the party started! The model kicked off Coachella weekend and #REVOLVEFestival with a poolside dinner in celebration of her collection Ale by Alessandra x Revolve. Fellow Victoria\u2019s Secret model Sara Sampaio, as well as A$AP Ferg and many influencers celebrated the collection by her side.\n\nKatie Jones/WWD/REX/Shutterstock\n\nGrammy-nominated singer and Coachella alum performer, Halsey, rode out to the desert bar crawl style with Three Olives Vodka. Along the way, Halsey and guests stopped at the Three Olives Thrift Shop with cocktails and shopping. The singer then surprised guests at The Saguaro in Palm Springs for the vodka brand\u2019s \u201cFind Otherness\u201d party.\n\nFriday, April 14\n\nDon\u2019t put it past REVOLVE to keep the parties going into the weekend. The leading online retailer threw a House of Harlow 1960 x REVOLVE brunch hosted by the one and only Nicole Richie at #hotelREVOLVE at the Arrive Hotel in Palm Springs, followed by The Blonde Salad Pool Party hosted by blogger Chiara Ferragni with a special performance by rapper A$AP Ferg and attendees including Shay Mitchell and Olivia Culpo.\n\nJerod Harris/Getty\n\nBut that was just Mitchell\u2019s first stop of the day. The Pretty Little Liars actress made her way over to the VELOCITY BLACK x 1OAK/Up & Down Beach Club, where partygoers attending the bash snacked on Catch LA sushi and desserts, refueled with massages by Zeel and IV drips, and even had the opportunity to jet-ski in the mega-mansion\u2019s very own backyard lake.\n\nUpon arrival, Mitchell posed for photos with her stylists, Marie-Lou and Chloe Bartoli. Those who opted for the day club instead of the festival danced to music by will DJ Taco (of ODD Future), as they sipped on cocktails by Absolut Elyx mixed with Red Bull, D\u2019usse and Budweiser. The star-studded guest list included some of Hollywood\u2019s finest, like Tobey Maguire, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Tyga, Russell Simmons, Rita Ora, Sofia Richie, Chanel Iman and more. Amid Tyga\u2019s recent split from girlfriend Kylie Jenner, an onlooker tells PEOPLE the rapper \u201cappeared to be in great spirits, as he sipped on a drink and partied with a table full of his male friends.\u201d\n\nThe rapper left the party with his entourage through the back entrance around 5:45 p.m., right around the same time Paris Hilton showed up hand-in-hand with Chris Zylka.\n\nWhile some were keen on showing affection, others just enjoyed the sunny California weather poolside at a private cabana with some best friends.\n\n\u201cOrlando was really low-key at the party. He wasn\u2019t flirting with any girls and was just wandering around with a guy friend,\u201d says an onlooker about the newly single star, whose ex Katy Perry partied at the FUNBOY X Smashbox pool party just miles away. \u201cTobey hung out at a VIP table and later spent time with his BFF Leonardo DiCaprio.\u201d\n\nFameFlynet\n\nAnother day, another fashion celebration. Ambrosio, along with model pals Jasmine Tookes, Josephine Skriver, Martha Hunt and Romee Strijd helped kick off the Sexy Little Things launch at the Victoria\u2019s Secret Angel Oasis with a poolside lunch. Meanwhile, guests enjoyed a relaxing afternoon at the desert retreat, which included everything from an ice cream truck to a live deejay to a styling suite by Hunt\u2019s stylist, Lindsay Grosswendt. Before the event, Skriver, Hunt and Australian actress Adelaide Kane also got a quick Tone It Up workout sesh in presented by fitness gurus Karena Dawn and Katrina Scott.\n\nXavier Collin/IPA/Splash News Online\n\nWell, it\u2019s safe to say Jenner and Tyga kept their distance at separate parties \u2014 so far, that is. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star attended the Pretty Little Things x PAPER Magazine party with besties Jordyn Woods and Stassie Karanikolaou. Once they arrived they decided to forgo the first stop at the carpet, and instead headed straight to the fun, where they quickly got comfortable at their VIP table by the pool and snacked on hamburgers and french fries while mingling with friends. Continuing on with fashion parties at Coachella, Hailee Steinfeld performed at Republic Records x sbe\u2019s \u201cThe Hyde Away\u201d Presented by Hudson. The singer-actress sang an acoustic set at the party (with mom, dad and boyfriend Cameron Smoller in the front row) and then stopped by the Hudson Jeans suite to grab festival swag.\n\nJonathan Leibson/Getty Images for NYLON Media\n\nFROM COINAGE: The Real Cost of Going to Coachella\n\nIt\u2019s a tough life bouncing from party to party. Mitchell and Ambrosio popped up at the FUNBOY x Smashbox pool party, and posed for pictures on/alongside the seahorse and festival flamingo pool floats. Also at the event was Perry, making her first public appearance since shaving off all of her blonde locks.\n\nSource: Katy Perry/Instagram\n\nMeanwhile over at the FORAY x VAMPPED DESERT OASIS, host Emily Ratajkowski and Foray Collective co-founder, Kaitlynn Carter, were spotted lounging poolside in shaded cabanas.

The Life of Kylie star showed up sporting her new purple hairdo in a snakeskin skirt and top set alongside Woods, as they took to the dance floor to show off some moves.\n\nNext up for Baldwin and Kendall Jenner was the Bootsy Bellow party, where the friends hung out at their poolside VIP cabana at the sprawling estate. \u201cThey seemed to be partners in crime for Coachella,\u201d says a source, adding that Jenner was in \u201cgood spirits\u201d at the event. Also enjoying the music and a performance by Lil Yachty was Katy Perry, who was overheard telling her Coachella posse that she dresses to make an entrance. The singer was also joined by fashionable friends Jeremy Scott and Mia Morretti.\n\nMeanwhile in another poolside cabana, Modern Family star Ariel Winter, with her new hot pink hairstyle, spent most of the afternoon perched on her boyfriend Levi Meaden\u2019s knee.

Not to mention guests had food options from several different trucks, including one that served delicious ice cream cookie sandwiches by Coolhaus.\n\nKatie Jones/WWD/REX/Shutterstock\n\nBut for those who wanted ice cream and massages, Rachel Zoe and The Zoe Report\u2019s \u201cZOEasis\u201d was the place to be. Fashion ladies like Chanel Iman, Kate Bosworth (both carrying MCM Worldwide bags), Jamie Chung dressed head-to-toe in pieces from the SS17 Rachel Zoe Collection were pampered with luxurious spa and facial treatments in the SK-II Extreme Expedition Skin Rescue lounge, as well as hair treatments like the signature Coachella braid and false lashes.

Once in the bus, Jonas took the role of deejay to get the party started, plugging in his phone and turning on his favorite Spotify station, \u201cRap Caviar.\u201d Once the crew arrived at the hotel, the crew opted to relax in their private hotel room for a bit before heading down to the secluded hammock area near the pool \u2013 where Jonas met up with his younger brother Nick and some other friends.
