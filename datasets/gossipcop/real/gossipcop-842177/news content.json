When host Andy Cohen said that she was caught in a \u201cmegawatt lie,\u201d Parks said, \u201cWhat more can I do? I apologized already and the person I\u2019m most concerned about is Porsha. I\u2019m sorry that it hurt Kandi as well.\u201d\n\nRelated: Real Housewives\u2019 Kids, Then And Now The women of 'The Real Housewives' have certainly changed and their kids have grown up before our eyes \u2014 click through to see their transformations\n\nA source previously told Us in late April that the reunion episodes were \u201cdisastrous\u201d for Parks. \u201cIt would be understandable if Phaedra didn\u2019t come back, but it\u2019s not finalized yet,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be Phaedra\u2019s decision, but Bravo\u2019s. It\u2019s bad.\u201d The insider added that that Parks\u2019 actions were \u201cincredibly painful and shocking.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Parks\u2019 rep slammed the rumors that the lawyer was fired as \u201cuntrue.\u201d\n\nParks\u2019 exit could mean more screen time for Kim Zolciak-Biermann, who will be returning to RHOA for season 10. The Don\u2019t Be Tardy star \u201cwon\u2019t be a full-time Housewife, but will be in a smaller role,\u201d a source told Us in April. \u201cHow many episodes she\u2019s in is being determined.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
