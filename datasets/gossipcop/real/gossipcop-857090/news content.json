But something goes wrong \u2013 when Corden gets stuck upside down.\n\nRichie takes advantage of his immobile host, spraying him with ketchup and mustard, attempting to knock him off the ceiling by throwing a soccer ball, a computer keyboard and an old telephone. He also sings a few lines of other hits, including \u201cStuck on You\u201d and \u201cAll Night Long,\u201d before heading out and leaving Corden to fend for himself.\n\nTrending Stories Kristen Bell Is the Star of a New Jesus Podcast From Fox.

One fan, Adele, stands out, he said smiling, because she put him in her video for her mega-hit, \u201cHello.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-lionel-richie-v1-e935231b-f73e-457a-a13c-0b8b8fbed22a.jpg?w=1341&h=788&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-lionel-richie-v1-e935231b-f73e-457a-a13c-0b8b8fbed22a.jpg?w=1341&h=788&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elias Leight", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/see-lionel-richie-james-corden-in-goofy-dancing-on-the-ceiling-spoof-195853/", "title": "See Lionel Richie, James Corden in Goofy \u2018Dancing on the Ceiling\u2019 Spoof", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Lionel Richie and James Corden remade Richie's \"Dancing on the Ceiling\" video with a modern twist.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Elias Leight", "tags": "James Corden, Lionel Richie, The Late Late Show With James Corden", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "See Lionel Richie, James Corden in Goofy 'Dancing on the Ceiling' Spoof", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/see-lionel-richie-james-corden-in-goofy-dancing-on-the-ceiling-spoof-195853/", "description": "Lionel Richie and James Corden remade Richie's \"Dancing on the Ceiling\" video with a modern twist.", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-lionel-richie-v1-e935231b-f73e-457a-a13c-0b8b8fbed22a.jpg?w=1341&h=788&crop=1", "width": 1341, "height": 788, "alt": "Lionel Richie on 'Corden'"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-25T14:02:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T16:04:05+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lionel Richie and James Corden remade Richie's \"Dancing on the Ceiling\" video with a modern twist.", "site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "See Lionel Richie, James Corden in Goofy \u2018Dancing on the Ceiling\u2019 Spoof", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/rs-lionel-richie-v1-e935231b-f73e-457a-a13c-0b8b8fbed22a.jpg?w=1341&h=788&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_gbql6bJuE"], "publish_date": 1495720920.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
