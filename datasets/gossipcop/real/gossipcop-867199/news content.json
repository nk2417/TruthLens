We were only kids when we fell in love, but we were kids who knew what we wanted out of life & who we wanted to get it with. Not a lot of people get that opportunity or blessing at such a young age. Even though we were so young, I wish I could go back as far as I could just to love you longer!\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI am just so happy & honored to be your husband. I love you SO much!\u201d ending the post with the hashtags #HappyAnniversary, #12YearsStrong, #SoulMates and #MiddleSchoolSweetheart.\n\nRelated: Teen Mom 2 Tots: My, How They\u2019ve Grown!
