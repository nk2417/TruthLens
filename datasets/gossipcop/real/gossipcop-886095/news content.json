Including star Chris Hemsworth, who is using the opportunity to indoctrinate his children!\n\nVideos by ComicBook.com\n\nThe actor posted a video to social media featuring his kids watching the film on an iPad, proud that he\u2019s \u201cbrainwashing\u201d them into becoming Marvel- no, THOR fans. Check it out in the video below.\n\nTo be fair, this is a marked improvement from the last update about Hemsworth\u2019s kids and their fondness for superheroes. He previously told E! that they preferred a different god from the DC Comics\u2019 pantheon.\n\n\u201cThey want to be Wonder Woman, both my sons and my daughter,\u201d Hemsworth said. \u201cYep, that\u2019s alright, I love Wonder Woman, it\u2019s cool. Different universe, but that\u2019s ok.\u201d\n\nThe kids also seem much more engrossed now that they\u2019re watching the finished product, because they were \u201cwildly unimpressed\u201d when they visited him on the set of the new film.\n\n\u201cThey were like, \u2018This is so boring! We thought you fought monsters for a living and you don\u2019t. You just pretend, and so we\u2019re going to wreck stuff,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what they did. They ran around and broke things\u2026 If they see the movie and they see all the special effects, which make me look cool, then I\u2019m the hero. But once they saw behind the curtain, it ruined it.\u201d\n\nIt looks like they just needed some time to process, because they\u2019re just as engrossed in the battle between the God of Thunder and Surtur as many viewers were when the film premiered in theaters.\n\nWho knows if Hemsworth will drag his kids to another Marvel Studios set in the future. With Avengers: Infinity War set to release in a couple of months and his filming completed on the untitled sequel, he\u2019s candid in admitting to Channel 7\u2019s Sunrise that he\u2018s \u201cdone\u201d with the role unless something compelling comes along.\n\n\u201cWe felt like we reinvented the last one in a big way,\u201d he said of Taika Waititi\u2019s Ragnarok. \u201cWe might have a conversation if there\u2019s another great script that comes along. But at the moment that\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThor: Ragnarok is now available on Digital HD, and will premiere on Blu-ray and DVD on March 6th.", "images": ["https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/Blooming-Love-Shonen-Jump.jpg?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-KpNhwJ0RxTQPU.gif", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/10/ComicBook-logo_40a31d.png", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/more-recent-sci-fi-movies.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/lego-black-friday.jpeg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/03/Netflix-Logo-N.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/08/Dexter-Resurrection-Suit.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/04/Cartoon-Network-Studios-Logo.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/zodiac-streaming-netflix.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/11/MixCollage-18-Nov-2025-07-00-PM-6150.jpg?w=300", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/themes/comicbook-2024/assets/images/comicbook-logo-white.png", "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/eb9b8d3d-fe15-45d5-ab1e-bc17074dabe4.png?w=1200"], "top_img": "https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2024/05/eb9b8d3d-fe15-45d5-ab1e-bc17074dabe4.png?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joseph Schmidt", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width"], "canonical_link": "https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/thor-ragnarok-chris-hemsworth-brainwash-kids/", "title": "Chris Hemsworth Shares Video of Brainwashing His Kids With \u2018Thor: Ragnarok\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chris Hemsworth Shares Video of Brainwashing His Kids With 'Thor: Ragnarok'", "description": "With Thor: Ragnarok now out on Digital HD, many people are experiencing the film from the comfort of their own homes.
