According to the outlet, his bail has been set at $100,000.\n\nIn the arrest warrant obtained by TMZ, the court magistrate reportedly found probable cause to believe Rogers attacked a woman named Lindsey Frazier. He reportedly slapped her, dragged her by the hair and pulled her hair out. The magistrate also reportedly says that Frazier credibly alleged Rogers had threatened her and her family\u2019s lives, and threw her phone against a wall to prevent her from calling 911.\n\nRogers\u2019 arrest comes nearly five months after his son, Camryn Kruze Rogers, was born. He announced in October 2017 that he and girlfriend Lindsey Renee were expecting a baby boy together. In January, In Touch reported that the couple had gotten married.\n\n\u201cMy boy !!! Finally !!!

I have talked about it enough. I did what was best for my body at that time, and I have moved on from it.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jenelle Evans Says She Has PTSD from Road Rage Incident: \u2018He Almost Knocked My Son Out\u2019\n\nHer divorce from Rogers was finalized prior to the birth of son Kaiser, 4, with ex-fianc\u00e9 Nathan Griffith. At the time, she said on Teen Mom 2: \u201cI\u2019m excited that we got this done before my baby\u2019s born and I\u2019m just happy that my last name is Evans again and not Rogers.\u201d\n\nShe is now married to David Eason, with whom she shares 19-month-old daughter Ensley Jolie.
