Beginning 10 a.m. ET/PT, the nominations will be carried live on TNT, TBS, and truTV.\n\nSAG-AFTRA president Gabrielle Carteris will introduce Awkwafina and Cox.

Meanwhile, \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d and \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d are expected to be top contenders on the TV side.\n\nThe 25th annual SAG Awards ceremony will be simulcast live on TNT and TBS on Sunday, Jan. 27, 2019 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.
