I can't decide/Fashion week is more your thing than mine,\u201d he adds.\n\nPeople have also pointed out the line, \u201cYou and your sister/Too hot to handle,\u201d could be a reference to Bella and her sis, Gigi Hadid.\n\nBella has heard the speculation, and she is setting the record straight. On Friday (June 29), she responded to the noise on Twitter. Replying to a Twitter user who implied Aubrey has had a lot of sex with celebrities, so why not Hadid, she fired back, \"Not me!!!\u200d\u2640\ufe0fthat\u2019s disrespectful. WHY CANT PPL BE FRIENDS W/o all the insinuation.\"\n\nDrake and Bella initially sparked dating rumors in 2017. Last June, they were spotted leaving a club together in Los Angeles. In October, the 6 God reportedly threw Bella a posh 21st birthday party at New York City's Socialista lounge.\n\nRecently, Hadid's name has been attached to The Weeknd, as the former couple appeared to rekindle their love by showing off PDA at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival in France in May.\n\nCheck out Bella's response to speculation that Drake's lyrics on \"Finesse\" are about her below.\n\nSee Photos of Drake's Different Looks Over the Years", "images": ["http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/10/attachment-cash-cobain-1.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/11/attachment-2025-bracket-mvp.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/11/attachment-drake-kendrick-lamar-baseball.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2019/09/attachment-diamond-rappers-eminem-drake-tupac-shakur-50-cent.jpg?w=980&q=75", "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2018/06/Bella-Hadid-Drake.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2024/07/attachment-eminem-drake-jay-z-tupac-shakur.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/11/attachment-spotify-drake-header.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/11/attachment-drake-what-did-i-miss-header.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/11/attachment-drake-the-office-movers-trailer.jpg?w=980&q=75", "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2017/10/xxl-trimmed-spacing.png", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2025/10/attachment-drake-rolex-barbie-watch-header.jpg?w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2018/06/Bella-Hadid-Drake.jpg?w=980&q=75"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2018/06/Bella-Hadid-Drake.jpg?w=1200&q=75&format=natural", "keywords": [], "authors": ["C.
