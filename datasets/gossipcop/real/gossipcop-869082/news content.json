If you somehow missed what happened or just need a refresher, we highly recommend you revisit the moment in the clip above, because it just needs to be seen to be believed.\n\nHow to Watch Watch The Real Housewives of Orange County on Bravo on Thursdays at 8/7c and next day on Peacock. Catch up on the Bravo app. Stream Now on\n\nLooking back on the incident while live tweeting the episode, Shannon seemed to suggest that one OC Housewife in particular was responsible for the drama breaking out. And no, it's not Kelly Dodd, with whom she argued at the restaurant.\n\nRelated\n\n\n\n\n\nShannon seemed to point the finger at Lydia McLaughlin since she extended the invitation to Kelly in the first place. \"Nothing would have happened if Lydia hadn't invited Kelly,\" Shannon tweeted, adding that \"it looks like [Lydia] likes to stir the pot.\"\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nHowever, Shannon is owning up to her part in the drama as well. \"Had a hard day and felt totally ambushed. I go to QW often and hadn't seen Kelly anywhere in 6 mos,\" she tweeted. \"Not happy about my yelling tho #imhuman.\"\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nShannon also tweeted that she wishes she \"handled everything differently\" at The Quiet Woman.\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nMeghan King Edmonds, who wasn't present for the meal, tweeted that she also thought it was \"so odd\" for Lydia to invite Kelly to the get-together when she knew she didn't get along with Shannon and Tamra.\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nTamra also didn't understand why Lydia invited Kelly to the dinner.\n\nCheck out the post on X\n\nAs for Lydia, she recently told Bravotv.com that she was completely taken aback by Shannon's reaction at The Quiet Woman. \"I thought [Peggy Sulahian] was gonna have a heart attack because I have never -- like I said the only time I met Shannon was at the party where she's yelling at me and runs away. And then I meet her again, and she's yelling at Kelly and in the bathroom and just the sight of her, I felt like she was gonna have a heart attack,\" she said. \"I don't know how else to describe it. It was very jarring... I don't understand her reaction.\"\n\nBut perhaps you'll be glad to know that all of this drama hasn't kept many of the RHOC ladies from returning to The Quiet Woman. Kelly recently told Bravotv.com that she still eats there \"all the time.\" In fact, Shannon and Tamra just paid a visit to the eatery on a double date with their husbands.\n\nCheck out the post on Instagram\n\nSee how the whole Quiet Woman drama began, below.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/icons/youtube-social.min.svg",
