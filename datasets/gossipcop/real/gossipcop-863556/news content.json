Let\u2019s talk about Serena Williams. You say she is the best female player in the world in the book. McEnroe: Best female player ever \u2014 no question. Garcia-Navarro: Some wouldn\u2019t qualify it, some would say she\u2019s the best player in the world. Why qualify it? McEnroe: Oh! Uh, she\u2019s not, you mean, the best player in the world, period? Garcia-Navarro: Yeah, the best tennis player in the world. You know, why say female player? McEnroe: Well because if she was in, if she played the men\u2019s circuit she\u2019d be like 700 in the world. Garcia-Navarro: You think so? McEnroe: Yeah. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t think Serena is an incredible player. I do, but the reality of what would happen would be I think something that perhaps it\u2019d be a little higher, perhaps it\u2019d be a little lower. And on a given day, Serena could beat some players. I believe because she\u2019s so incredibly strong mentally that she could overcome some situations where players would choke \u2019cause she\u2019s been in it so many times, so many situations at Wimbledon, The U.S. Open, etc. But if she had to just play the circuit \u2014 the men\u2019s circuit \u2014 that would be an entirely different story.\n\nAs I wrote at the time, it was a pretty 'gotcha' line of questioning from the host. McEnroe repeatedly lavished praise on Serena's ability but didn't steer away from the line of questioning above, creating a backlash that Serena responded to on Monday:\n\nMcEnroe could've just left it there, but his tennis player instinct to volley back apparently cropping back up, he did the opposite. McEnroe doubled down on the comment by refusing to apologize.\n\nClarified that he didn't know it would create controversy, and that he didn't intend to bother Serena during her pregnancy.\n\nFollowing with a claim that, at 58, he would right now rank 1,200 on if he played full time.\n\nBefore concluding by mockingly re-ranking the best tennis players in history, putting Serena at No. 5.\n\nMore Tennis!\n\nAnna Kournikova seen in public for first time in years in new photos\n\nWho is Alexander Zverev's girlfriend?
