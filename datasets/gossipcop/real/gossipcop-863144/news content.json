They were in the midwest for the ZPL Birthday Bash, which also featured Flo Rida, Fifth Harmony, James Arthur and Aaron Carter.\n\n\u201cLook who I found,\u201d Payne teases in selfie mode before twisting his phone to reveal Horan, who also had his phone at the ready. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d he asks his smiling bandmate in the post.\n\n\u201cAnd we\u2019re here with the horse show, as well,\u201d Horan noted in his post, moving from \u201cPayno\u201d to show the horse track they were near. Horan gets photo credit for the tousled hair selfie that came next.\n\nOne Direction, formed on The X Factor in 2010, went on hiatus in 2016 shortly after founding member Zayn Malik left the group to pursue his own solo career.\n\nAnd Payne and Horan\u2019s solo careers are off to their own impressive start.\n\nSource: Niall Horan/Instagram\n\nSource: Liam Payne/Instagram\n\nHoran\u2019s debut album arrives in the fall, following hit singles \u201cThis Town\u201d and \u201cSlow Hands.\u201d Meanwhile, Payne has released his own debut single, a hip-hop inspired pop track called \u201cStrip That Down,\u201d as well as welcomed his first son, Bear, in March.\n\nDespite separate professional paths, the bandmates still rallied around Harry Styles after he lost his stepfather Robin Twist this week.\n\n\u201cDevastated to hear the news about Robin. He was such a lovely, kind and funny guy. Sending all my love to the whole family,\u201d Louis Tomlinson, who lost his own mother late last year, tweeted. \u201cYou\u2019ll be missed mate.\u201d Added Payne, \u201cHarry my heart really goes out to you \u2013 such an extremely sad day for us all who knew Robin. What a kind, gentle and beautiful soul, a true rarity to find in today\u2019s world. Sometimes they really do take the best of us far too soon.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Hear Why TI Decided To Bring His Hit Reality Show To an End\n\n\u201cVery sad to hear about the loss of Robin,\u201d Horan wrote. \u201cFor those who had the pleasure of knowing Robin will know that he was the nicest, kindest, most generous , hilariously funny guy you\u2019ll have met. He always had a smile on his face even when he was battling the terrible illness. Love ya H. Please give your mum and the rest of the family a massive hug from my family.\u201d", "images":
