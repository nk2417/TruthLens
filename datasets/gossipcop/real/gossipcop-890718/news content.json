It did not happen,\u201d Piven said in the statement to Deadline. \u201cIt takes a great deal of courage for victims to come forward with their histories, and my hope is that the allegations about me that didn\u2019t happen, do not detract from stories that should be heard.\u201d\n\nBellamar\u2019s October 30 claims on Twitter quickly were picked up by mainstream media on Tuesday, prompting CBS, the network that airs Piven\u2019s Wisdom of the Crowd, and HBO, which carried Entourage, to issue statements.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of the media reports and are looking into the matter,\u201d a CBS spokesperson said Tuesday.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nSaid HBO today: \u201cToday, via the press reports, is the first we are hearing about Ariane Bellamar\u2019s allegations concerning Jeremy Piven. Everyone at HBO and our productions is aware that zero tolerance for sexual harassment is our policy. Anyone experiencing an unsafe working environment has several avenues for making complaints that we take very seriously.\u201d\n\nHere is the trio of tweets by Bellamar about Piven and his alleged unwelcomed interactions with her, that triggered the response:\n\nHey @jeremypiven! \u2018Member when you cornered me in your trailer on the #Entourage set? \u2018Member grabbing my boobies on the \ud83d\udecb without asking?? \u2014 Ariane Bellamar (@ArianeBellamar) October 30, 2017\n\n\u2018Member when I tried to leave; you grabbed me by the ass, looked at yourself in the mirror, & said what a \u2018beautiful couple\u2019 we made? #MeToo https://t.co/liD7irs0o0 \u2014 Ariane Bellamar (@ArianeBellamar) October 30, 2017", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jeremy-piven-4.jpg?w=576", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jeremy-piven-4.jpg?w=576&h=383&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jeremy-piven-4.jpg?w=576", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nellie Andreeva", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2017/10/jeremy-piven-denies-groping-accusations-entourage-sexual-assault-ariane-bellamar-1202198959/", "title": "Jeremy Piven \u201cUnequivocally\u201d Denies Groping Accusations: \u201cIt Did Not Happen\u201d", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Entourage and Wisdom of the Crowd starJeremy Piven denied\u00a0Ariane Bellamar's\u00a0accusations that the actor groped her on the set of\u00a0Entourage.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Nellie Andreeva", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jeremy Piven \u201cUnequivocally\u201d Denies Groping Accusations: \u201cIt Did Not Happen\u201d", "url": "https://deadline.com/2017/10/jeremy-piven-denies-groping-accusations-entourage-sexual-assault-ariane-bellamar-1202198959/", "description": "Entourage and Wisdom of the Crowd starJeremy Piven denied\u00a0Ariane Bellamar's\u00a0accusations that the actor groped her on the set of\u00a0Entourage.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jeremy-piven-4.jpg?w=576", "width": 576, "height": 600, "alt": "Jeremy Piven Denies Groping Accusations: \"It Did Not Happen\""}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-01T00:41:15+00:00", "modified_time": "2024-12-19T00:20:20+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Entourage and Wisdom of the Crowd starJeremy Piven denied\u00a0Ariane Bellamar's\u00a0accusations that the actor groped her on the set of\u00a0Entourage.", "site": "@Deadline", "creator": "@DeadlineNellie", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jeremy Piven \u201cUnequivocally\u201d Denies Groping Accusations: \u201cIt Did Not Happen\u201d", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/jeremy-piven-4.jpg?w=576"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509496875.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
