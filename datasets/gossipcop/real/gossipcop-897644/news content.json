The event, which was live-streamed on Twitter, featured knockout performances from Camila Cabello, Grace Vanderwaal, Kehlani and Kelly Clarkson, as well as appearances from a host of musicians including Mary J. Blige, Tori Kelly, Betty Who, Solange and, of course, Woman of the Year nominee Selena Gomez.\n\nBut as viewers watched from home, there were plenty of things going on behind the scenes that they have missed out on.\n\n\u2013 As artists filed onto the magenta carpet, Kehlani, in a shimmering silver ensemble, greeted Ciara as she walked by, bowing her hands down to the \u201c1, 2 Step\u201d singer and then walking away \u2014 right after fanning her hands towards her face and stating, \u201cI\u2019m so hot!\u201d\n\n\u2013 Before the event began, Diplo posed in the photo area ahead of the event, during which he introduced Cabello\u2019s performance. But they had a run-in prior to the Cabello taking the stage, as the former Fifth Harmony singer squealed in delight when she saw him backstage and gave the Major Lazer producer a hug.\n\n\u2013 While the evening was about honoring career accomplishments, it was also an opportunity for the women to compare style notes. Honorees Jody Gerson, chairman/CEO Universal Music Group Publishing, and Capitol Music Group COO Michelle Jubelirer discussed how long they could go between bang trims with Interscope senior VP of Strategic Development Erika Savage (named one of Women In Music\u2019s 5 of the Rise), and past honoree, Harvest Records and Caroline GM Jacqueline Saturn. The consensus? Every two weeks.\n\n\u2013 Diane Warren is already deep into awards season, with the legendary songwriter penning two songs up for Oscar consideration: \u201cStand Up for Something\u201d from Marshall and \u201cPrayers For This World\u201d from Cries from Syria. (Of the two, Warren likes her chances better with \u201cStand Up for Something.\u201d) Should either song receive a nod, it will be Warren\u2019s ninth Oscar nomination for best song.\n\n\u2013 Powerhouse Award recipient Kelly Clarkson was typically humble\u2014and hilarious\u2014about receiving the honor. Talking to Billboard at the start of the ceremony, Clarkson, who was there with husband Brandon, joked that all her friends were calling her about the award. \u201cThey\u2019re saying, \u2018Are you sure there wasn\u2019t a mistake?'\u201d\n\n\u2013 Clarkson was on hand in the photo area as the audience was taking its seats, with music from the night\u2019s honorees blaring through the sound system. \u201cLove So Soft,\u201d her Grammy-nominated new single, was one of them, and Clarkson didn\u2019t waste an opportunity to sing along to the chorus, snapping her fingers as she maneuvered backstage.\n\n\u2013 As Cabello delivered a stripped-down rendition of her hit \u201cHavana,\u201d in the crowd, Mary J. Blige clapped and swayed along to the track, which currently sits at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\u2013 As Taraji P. Henson sang Mary J. Blige\u2019s praises while introducing her Icon Award, pop singer Betty Who slipped into to the audience a bit late, but in sharp style.\n\n\u2013 Backstage, Blige was doing press after accepting her award as Solange and her entourage walked by. \u201cHey Solange, you look beautiful!\u201d said Blige with a laugh. Later, before Solange returned to her seat after receiving the American Express Impact Award, she stooped down to hug and congratulate Blige. Blige was in high demand: as soon as the evening concluded, she and Pharrell Williams shared a warm embrace as they caught up.\n\n\u2013 Woman of the Year honoree Selena Gomez gathered her friends Elle Fanning and actress Francia Raisa \u2014 who had just presented her with the award \u2014 backstage in the photo area, posing for shots with one another.\n\n\u2013 Williams also spends a few minutes hugging, chatting and posing for photos with two other WIM honorees: Kehlani and Solange.\n\n\u2013 After the show wrapped, some of the evening\u2019s stars stuck around for photo opps. Ciara was spotted on the step and repeat posing in her flowing gown, while inside, Kehlani wrangled her team to smile for the camera.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/camila-cabello-selfie-bb-wim-red-carpet-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/camila-cabello-selfie-bb-wim-red-carpet-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Billboard Staff", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/billboard-women-in-2017-what-you-didnt-see-on-twitter-8054855/", "title": "The 12 Things You Didn\u2019t See on Twitter at Billboard Women in Music 2017", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Kelly Clarkson, Selena Gomez and Camila Cabello are just a few of the honorees on hand for the annual event.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Billboard Staff", "tags": "Women in Music", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "The 12 Things You Didn\u2019t See on Twitter at Billboard Women in Music 2017", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/billboard-women-in-2017-what-you-didnt-see-on-twitter-8054855/", "description": "Kelly Clarkson, Selena Gomez and Camila Cabello are just a few of the honorees on hand for the annual event.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/camila-cabello-selfie-bb-wim-red-carpet-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Camila Cabello, 2017"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-01T16:44:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-01T18:08:20+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Kelly Clarkson, Selena Gomez and Camila Cabello are just a few of the honorees on hand for the annual event.", "site": "@billboard", "creator": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The 12 Things You Didn\u2019t See on Twitter at Billboard Women in Music 2017", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/camila-cabello-selfie-bb-wim-red-carpet-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512146696.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
