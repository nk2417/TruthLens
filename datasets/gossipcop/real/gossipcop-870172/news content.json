The State Attorney\u2019s Office tells The Blast that because cops grabbed Repp before he came in contact with Beckinsale, his actions did not proceed far enough to be considered stalking.\n\nIn the police report, cops described Repp as having \"an irrational obsession with\" Beckinsale and say he has \"traveled across the country in an effort to harass her.\"\n\nArticle continues below advertisement\n\nAccording to police, Repp had an incident with Beckinsale in Salt Lake City back in 2016 where he allegedly made physical contact with Beckinsale where he touched her in the back. Police say Repp \"made a statement to the victim in reference to stabbing her.\"", "images": ["https://theblast.com/assets/facebook_black.svg", "https://theblast.com/assets/logo-primary.svg", "https://theblast.com/assets/flipboard_black.svg", "https://theblast.com/assets/email_black.svg", "https://theblast.com/assets/x_black.svg", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2025/04/10103529/favicon-16x16-1.png", "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/brand-img/123/0x0/previous/3c33143007769c732778bff3fa701cfd.jpg"], "top_img": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2025/04/10103529/favicon-16x16-1.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/58195/kate-beckinsale-alleged-stalker/", "title": "Kate Beckinsale's Alleged Stalker Has All Charges Dropped", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kate Beckinsale's Alleged Stalker Has All Charges Dropped", "url": "https://theblast.com/58195/kate-beckinsale-alleged-stalker/", "site_name": "The Blast"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/TheBlastnews", "published_time": "2017-09-19T05:25:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-09-19T05:25:00+00:00"}, "author": "TheBlast Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@undefined", "site": "@theblastnews"}, "keywords": "Uncategorized,Kate Beckinsale", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://theblast.prod.media.wordpress.mattersmedia.io/2025/04/10103517/android-chrome-192x192-1.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505798700.0, "source": "https://theblast.com", "summary": ""}
