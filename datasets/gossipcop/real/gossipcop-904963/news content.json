In case you need a refresher on how Dan died before we head into the new episodes, allow us to take you for a quick stroll down memory lane.\n\nIn the ninth and final season, in episode 24, Roseanne reveals that Dan died after suffering a heart attack at Darlene (Sara Gilbert) and David's (Johnny Galecki) wedding in the previous season. Although Dan has an affair outside of his marriage in the last season of the show, in the end, it is revealed to be a fictitious event made up in Roseanne's mind, along with the fact that she did not win the lottery, either. In the finale, we also learn that the entire series was based on a book that Roseanne was writing about her life, only she had changed the details for parts of her life that she didn't like. Bizarre, we know.", "images": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/dxJ7pSJgq7lvZIba6R0rPdfK7Jc=/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2018/03/07/696/n/1922283/07ca6f835aa00861cd2c55.32857788_.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/caCGtlDSGmuV_By95GpIoq9afP8=/fit-in/792x523/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2018/01/17/896/n/1922283/tmp_cEbEji_47477baf42840f4f_TSDROSE_EC041.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/iUoy7fSCWFp5810VoB0nG7Lg884=/fit-in/2600x1358/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2018/01/17/895/n/1922283/9c91d7975a5fb214625fa6.19930973_edit_img_facebook_post_image_file_17053398_1516217175.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/iUoy7fSCWFp5810VoB0nG7Lg884=/fit-in/2600x1358/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2018/01/17/895/n/1922283/9c91d7975a5fb214625fa6.19930973_edit_img_facebook_post_image_file_17053398_1516217175.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Terry Carter", "Updated On March", "At Pm"], "canonical_link": "https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/how-did-dan-die-roseanne-44506616", "title": "How Dan Dies in Roseanne's Finale Will Still Break Your Heart, 20 Years Later", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "keywords": "popsugar, terry carter, standard, entertainment, tv, john goodman, roseanne tv show, nostalgia", "robots": "max-image-preview:large, follow, index", "bingbot": "nocache", "google-site-verification": "-ULnbgnS51gqvbNlz7JAhFDpYe74n2hhzpfc4KXeONA", "description": "PS makes wellness more accessible through real-life stories, first-person perspectives, and expert-backed information.
