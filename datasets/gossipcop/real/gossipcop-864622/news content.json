News that \"anyone with a sense of outrage is compelled to resist,\" referring to his refusal to pay a $250 fine for protesting an energy facility in Orange County in 2015.\n\nCromwell and another activist were detained in December, 2015, for demonstrating near the construction site of the CPV Valley Energy Center in Orange County. The group Protect Orange County opposes the company's use of fracked natural gas.\n\nCromwell was arrested for disorderly conduct and ordered to pay $250, but was sentenced to a week in county jail after refusing to pay the fine.\n\nCromwell has also previously been escorted from a business event featuring the company, and arrested for protesting a separate energy company near Seneca Lake.\n\nThe plant, on its website, says the Orange County facility \"will meet the stringent limits set by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation for VOC, NOx, SO2, PM and formaldehyde to protect human health and environment.\"\n\nCromwell was nominated for an Oscar for his role as Farmer Hoggett in \"Babe,\" and has numerous other acting credits in films and TV shows such as \"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" \"Little House on the Prarie,\" \"All in the Family,\" \"The Green Mile,\" The Sum of All Fears,\" and more.", "images":
