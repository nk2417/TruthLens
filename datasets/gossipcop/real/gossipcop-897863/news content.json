The media was quick to observe how the show about a newly-separated single woman who is vying to become a stand-up in a male-dominated late 1950s world, just rang so loudly with the times.\n\n\u201cYou never set out to drive a political message through your show, it just won\u2019t work,\u201d said Sherman-Palladino, \u201cYou gotta love the show, love your characters, it was an interesting fluke that Maisel came out when we were taking trolls down. I\u2019m glad it\u2019s a character that still resonates. We can look back at 1959 and see that today women aren\u2019t wearing corsets anymore, but the problems still exist.\u201d\n\nThe entire late 50s comedy era \u201cis Oz\u201d for Sherman-Palladino having grown up in the San Fernando Valley, listening to her father\u2019s story about Greenwich Village, and opening up for Johnny Mathis and Dinah Washington.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nSeason 2 is \u201cabout opening Midge\u2019s world up,\u201d says Palladino. Buzz has been that there\u2019s an episode set in Paris, as well as one in the comedy stomping ground of the era, the Catskills.\n\n\u201cThere are dragons,\u201d joked EP Daniel Palladino, making a Game of Thrones reference.", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/marvelous-mrs-maisel-19.jpg?w=1024", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/marvelous-mrs-maisel-19.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/marvelous-mrs-maisel-19.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anthony D'Alessandro", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/09/the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-season-2-to-definitely-stream-this-year-1202466347/", "title": "\u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u2019 Season 2 To Definitely Stream This Year", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Season 2 To Stream This Year", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Anthony D'Alessandro", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u2019 Season 2 To Definitely Stream This Year", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/09/the-marvelous-mrs-maisel-season-2-to-definitely-stream-this-year-1202466347/", "description": "'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Season 2 To Stream This Year", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/marvelous-mrs-maisel-19.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 684, "alt": "'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Season 2 To Stream This Year"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-09-18T03:45:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-09-18T04:29:04+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "'The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel' Season 2 To Stream This Year", "site": "@Deadline", "creator": "@AwardsTony", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u2019 Season 2 To Definitely Stream This Year", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/marvelous-mrs-maisel-19.jpg?w=1024"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1537242340.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
