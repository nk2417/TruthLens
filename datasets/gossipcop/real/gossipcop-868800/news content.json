Now, the couple have come to be emblematic of the British royal family, representing the kind of stability that Queen Elizabeth II once provided while also acclimating to today\u2019s values and principles.\n\nThey first met as students at St. Andrews University, where William studied geography while Kate, then known as Kate Middleton, studied art history. \u201cI knew there was something very special about her, and then I knew there was possibly something I wanted to explore there, but we ended up being friends for a while,\u201d William recalled during their 2010 engagement interview. \u201cI do genuinely believe now that being friends with [each other] is a massive advantage.\u201d\n\nSince then, William and Kate have experienced massive amounts of change together within the royal family, from Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan\u2019s exit in 2020 to the ascension of King Charles III to the British throne. They have also welcomed three children: Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis.\n\nAhead, we break down the complete timeline of the Prince and Princess of Wales\u2019s decades-spanning love story.\n\nSamir Hussein // Getty Images\n\n2001: They meet at St. Andrews University.\n\nThe two first met as students at Scotland\u2019s St. Andrews University, where they initially started out as friends. They both studied art history, though William later changed his degree to pursue geography.\n\nSome have speculated that Kate specifically chose to attend St. Andrews University to be in closer proximity to the future king.\n\n\u201cKate was very strategic,\u201d royal historian Robert Lacey wrote in his 2020 book , per Elle. \u201cShe gave up her place at one of Britain\u2019s premier universities, Edinburgh, and opted for another one [St. Andrews] that probably didn\u2019t have the same academic standard. She had already been to Edinburgh to get her flat accommodations sorted out, but switched universities and switched her courses to history of art because that was William\u2019s. She delayed her own education by a year\u201d and took the chance of not getting into St. Andrews, Lacey wrote.\n\nLacey noted that Kate wasn\u2019t the only incoming student who changed her academic plans for William. After William announced his intention to study at St. Andrews, applications reportedly increased by 44 percent.\n\nUK Press // Getty Images Prince William visits St. Andrews University\u2019s campus.\n\n2002: They move in together and start dating.\n\nTo start their second year at St. Andrews, Kate and William, along with friends Fergus Boyd and Olivia Bleasdale, moved into a four-bedroom, two-story town house off campus. At this point, the two were still just friends\u2014but not for much longer.\n\nDuring their time as roommates, Kate and William\u2019s relationship took a romantic turn. Rumor has it, William became romantically interested in Kate after seeing her walk the runway for a charity fashion show, wearing a see-through minidress over a bra and underwear set. The dress, designed by Charlotte Todd, later sold at auction for $125,000.\n\nRune Hellestad - Corbis // Getty Images\n\nApril 1, 2004: Their relationship becomes public.\n\nAfter about a year of dating, William and Kate\u2019s relationship became public knowledge when The Sun published photos of the two enjoying a ski trip in the Swiss Alps. The breach of privacy led to the then-Prince Charles threatening to sever his media relations with the tabloid.\n\nAt the time, a spokesperson for Charles said he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d by the outlet\u2019s actions and that The Sun would \u201cface the consequences,\u201d according to The Guardian. \u201cThey do understand that they have broken the agreement and they are aware they will have to face the consequences. It's not set in stone but that could include being excluded from photo calls.\u201d\n\nJulian Herbert // Getty Images Prince Harry, then-Prince Charles, and Prince William pose during a 2002 photo call at Swiss ski resort.\n\nJune 23, 2005: They graduate from St. Andrews.\n\nThe couple ended their journey in higher education together, joining their class of about 260 students for an intimate graduation ceremony.

You find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn\u2019t realized. I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you\u2019re younger, and I really valued that time for me, as well.\u201d\n\nMax Mumby/Indigo // Getty Images\n\nJune 2007: They reconcile.\n\nTheir split was short-lived, with the couple reconciling just a few months later.\n\nRoyal reporter Katie Nicholl in her book Kate: The Future Queen. William, who initiated the breakup, apparently had to convince Kate to get back together with him.\n\n\u201cKate didn't want to rush anything. She had been badly hurt and told William she needed some time,\u201d Nicholl wrote. When William invited his ex to a costume party, Kate showed up dressed as a \u201csexy\u201d nurse \u201cin fishnet tights and a short dress.\u201d Subsequently, the prince \u201cfollowed her around like a lost puppy all night.\u201d\n\nTheir reunion was publicly confirmed when Kate attended the Concert for Diana, organized by William and Prince Harry in honor of the 10th anniversary of Princess Diana\u2019s death, in July 2007.\n\nDavid Davies - PA Images // Getty Images Harry, William, and Kate watch a rugby match together in 2007.\n\nOctober 20, 2010: William proposes.\n\nWilliam got down on one knee during a romantic getaway the two took to Kenya, where they stayed in a cabin hut on a wildlife reserve about 10,500 feet above sea level.\n\n\u201cWe had a little private time away together with some friends, and I just decided that it was the right time, really,\u201d William later said, during their joint engagement interview. \u201cWe\u2019d been talking about marriage for a while, so it wasn\u2019t a massively big surprise, but I took her up somewhere nice in Kenya, and I proposed.\u201d\n\nKate said the proposal was \u201cvery romantic,\u201d a sentiment that William shared. \u201cIt just felt really right to ask in Africa,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I had done a little bit of planning of sorts to share my romantic side.\u201d\n\nWilliam popped the question with Princess Diana\u2019s iconic engagement ring: a 12-carat oval sapphire surrounded by a white gold halo featuring 14 solitaire diamonds.\n\nWPA Pool // Getty Images\n\nNovember 16, 2010: They publicly announce their engagement.\n\nThe couple formally announced their engagement a month later, when they appeared for a photo call at London\u2019s St. James\u2019s Palace.
