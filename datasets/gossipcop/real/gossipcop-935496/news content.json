Molly Ephraim and Flynn Morrison, who played Mandy and Boyd Baxter \u2014 the middle daughter and grandson, respectively, of Tim Allen\u2018s Mike Baxter \u2014 during the series\u2019 run on ABC, have opted not to return for Season 7. Both roles are in the process of being recast, Deadline has confirmed.\n\nCreated by Jack Burditt, Last Man Standing stars Allen as a married father of three girls who tries to maintain his manliness in a world increasingly dominated by women.\n\nThe rest of the show\u2019s core cast is back including Allen, Nancy Travis, Jonathan Adams, Amanda Fuller, Christoph Sanders and Jordan Masterson. Also back is co-star Hector Elizondo whose deal to return \u2014 made last month \u2014 was originally in second position to his NBC comedy pilot Guess Who Died. That pilot was not picked up by the network and was shopped unsuccessfully. The options on the cast recently lapsed, rendering everyone, including Elizondo, available to take other series jobs.\n\nKevin Abbott, who served as an executive producer on the original series for most of its six seasons on ABC, with stints as showrunner in Season 1 and the second half of Season 6, is back as executive producer/showrunner for Season 7. He will be joined by three other veteran Last Man Standing writer/executive producers: Matt Berry \u2014 who also served as showrunner on the original \u2014 Kevin Hench and Ed Yeager.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\nLast Man Standing, from 20th Century Fox TV, is slated to return to its longtime Friday 8 PM slot in the fall.\n\nDeadline\u2019s sister site TVLine was first to report the recastings.", "images": ["https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/last-man-standing1.jpg?w=1024", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/last-man-standing1.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/last-man-standing1.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nellie Andreeva Denise Petski", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2018/07/last-man-standing-recasting-two-roles-season-7-molly-ephraim-flynn-morrison-1202420742/", "title": "\u2018Last Man Standing\u2019 Recasting Two Roles Ahead Of Season 7 On Fox", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Last Man Standing will be without two of its original cast members for its upcoming revival on Fox.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Nellie Andreeva,Denise Petski", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Last Man Standing\u2019 Recasting Two Roles Ahead Of Season 7 On Fox", "url": "https://deadline.com/2018/07/last-man-standing-recasting-two-roles-season-7-molly-ephraim-flynn-morrison-1202420742/", "description": "Last Man Standing will be without two of its original cast members for its upcoming revival on Fox.", "site_name": "Deadline", "image": {"identifier": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/last-man-standing1.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 683, "alt": "Last Man Standing"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-02T20:14:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-04T05:02:13+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Last Man Standing will be without two of its original cast members for its upcoming revival on Fox.", "site": "@Deadline", "creator": "@DeadlineNellie", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Last Man Standing\u2019 Recasting Two Roles Ahead Of Season 7 On Fox", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/last-man-standing1.jpg?w=1024"}, "y_key": "a810be562637c603", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530562492.0, "source": "https://deadline.com", "summary": ""}
