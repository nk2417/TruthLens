We\u2019re sitting in the Guggenheim Museum cafe overlooking Central Park, chatting about viral TikTok tracks, and she\u2019s trying to remember the name of that Billie Eilish number from the Barbie movie. \u201cI used to float\u2026\u201d Dove sings, in a voice that immediately cuts through the noise around us. She does it without any self-consciousness, like the way other people sing while they\u2019re doing their dishes or in the shower. In our case, three heads immediately turn in our direction. If they hadn\u2019t realized they were in the same room as An Extremely Talented Famous Person, they know now.\n\nHer fans have, of course, known all along. They\u2019ve been with the 28-year-old since the beginning\u2014or since 2013, when she was 17, if we\u2019re being literal\u2014when she starred as the titular twins in the Disney Channel series Liv and Maddie. Then those fans multiplied when she played Mal in the hugely popular Descendants franchise, also on Disney. She had children across the country in a chokehold (if you need proof of this, two high school girls spotted Dove on our way out of the museum and literally squealed with delight) even if their parents couldn\u2019t pick her out of a lineup. But then she showed off a powerhouse voice in Hairspray Live! and a new category of stans joined in. Appearing alongside Jennifer Aniston in Netflix\u2019s Dumplin\u2019 in 2018 didn\u2019t hurt either; neither did her role in Apple TV+\u2019s musical comedy Schmigadoon! And then there was the music, which served as a soundtrack to every Descendants movie and helped her rake in Spotify listeners before she had a chance to create her own sound.\n\nOscar de la Renta dress. Los Angeles Apparel blue tights. Area platforms.\n\nBut around the time she turned 24, some of that work started to feel at odds with the person she was becoming. She did the classic \u201cI\u2019m an adult now\u2014get on board or get lost\u201d thing that most former Disney kids are forced to do: She broke up with a long-term boyfriend, came out as queer, dyed her hair dark brunette, added to the tattoo collection she started when she was 14, released a song that went viral in part because she talks about yearning for another woman, and spent a lot of time processing trauma\u2014including the death of her father when she was 15\u2014that she\u2019d been living with but hadn\u2019t gotten the chance to really get through. It was a complete overhaul.\n\nAnd the result of all that internal stuff is, unsurprisingly, a personal and professional life that looks completely different from everything up until now. She\u2019s playing the lead in Obsession, an upcoming super-dark thriller series from Amazon Prime Video. And her debut album, Alchemical: Volume 1, released in December, serves as a purging of the past. The self-written lyrics flip-flop between fuck-you aggression and relatable desperation: \u201cI eat boys like you for breakfast\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s worse? Being wanted but not loved or loved but not wanted?\u201d But Volume 2, due out soon, is the topic of conversation as we stroll through the galleries\u2014that and the enthrallingly electric phase she finds herself in now. It\u2019s not just the result of the self-described emotional \u201cbloodletting,\u201d although that\u2019s a big part of it. It\u2019s her newish Met Gala red-carpet-worthy relationship with M\u00e5neskin lead singer and certified Italian Hot Man Damiano David. It\u2019s the attention she\u2019s paid to her mental health. It\u2019s the choice to leave a certain version of herself behind.\n\nWe\u2019re currently hanging out in a place that\u2019s a shrine to artistic expression, so forgive me for this very basic question that I\u2019m using to tie us to our setting, but did you always know you wanted to pursue a career in the arts?\n\nWhen you\u2019re a child, you\u2019re not thinking, I have to choose a career path. You\u2019re like, I like movies, I like music, and I like clothes. My first big purchase was the entry-level Brother sewing machine that looks like a Simpsons cartoon. I used to take my dad\u2019s work T-shirts and I would turn them into dresses and skirts that used his neck hole for my waist hole. I was 8.\n\nMy sister and I grew up with an emphasis on any sort of artistic expression, like the theater, movies. My dad was also a pianist, so it was jazz music, classical music. My mom started us in the local theater when we were quite young. So I felt very lucky because it was never like, \u201cThat\u2019s an unrealistic profession.\u201d My parents couldn\u2019t care less what I did.\n\nPosse cardigan. Anna October bralette. Leset stirrup leggings. Area platforms. Essentiel Antwerp earrings. David Webb rings. Valentino sunglasses.\n\nThey were never like, \u201cYou have to be an accountant.\u201d\n\nNo. If I told my mom I wanted to be an archaeologist, if I told my mom I wanted to sit by the river and paint pictures all day, they\u2019d be supportive if I was happy. It was a huge gift they gave me.\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that you ended up on the Disney Channel anyway, because it\u2019s such a mainstream culture machine that kids like me watched instead of listening to their father play jazz music on a piano.\n\nI think about that all the time. By the time I was living in L.A. and auditioning for things, there were just so few roles for kids that age. So I ended up going out for a couple of Disney pilots before one of the casting directors called my agent, and was like, \u201cFirst of all, she\u2019s not funny. Second of all, she\u2019s got this kind of dark edge that is really off-putting and it\u2019s never going to work for Disney.\u201d\n\nSo you had to decide if you wanted to make yourself into what they wanted you to be.\n\nIt\u2019s not that I was crazy edgy or anything, but I didn\u2019t really fit. And now, I think there\u2019s a very strong idea of who I am, and I feel very passive in terms of being an editor of that. But I didn\u2019t understand when I was a kid that there was no revisiting your first introduction to the public. And I had no idea who I was or what I was doing. And so I didn\u2019t realize how strongly they felt about who they thought I was until I stepped back and I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t even know where to begin to rectify this because it was so far off.\u201d\n\nYour recent music is such a huge reclamation of your image. It comes through in the lyrics, the sound. It\u2019s both a rebellion and a reintroduction. You\u2019ve spoken in other interviews about how working on Alchemical: Volume 1 was very much a processing of trauma and how the second portion was going to feel very different. What\u2019s coming through for you in Volume 2?\n\nWhen I was writing part one, I was doing it structurally really differently. I would sit down for maybe a week at a time or four days here and there and try to write as many songs as possible. And then a few weeks would go by and I\u2019d go back in. I was feeling a lot, but I hadn\u2019t gotten to the other side of what I was feeling to the point where I could write about it with perspective. It just kind of felt like a swirling current experience. When I started writing Volume 2, I really thought I was only going to write four or five more songs. And then I started doing this exercise. The very first week of January, I started going in Monday through Friday, 9 to 5, sometimes two sessions a day, sometimes trying to write three songs a day and just see what comes of it.\n\nAnd the music that was coming out of it was sonically very different. I felt like a completely different artist. The messaging, the energy, the vocals, the identity, everything just sort of transformed. And my label basically was like, \u201cOkay, we don\u2019t want to interrupt this. Don\u2019t travel, don\u2019t go anywhere.\u201d It was a desk job, a 9-to-5, you clock in no matter what, and sometimes you\u2019re like, \u201cWow, I really fucking hated that song and no one\u2019s ever going to hear it, and that\u2019s totally fine because I\u2019m back in tomorrow.\u201d\n\nIt always feels so douchey to talk about a sound, this stupid ephemeral thing you can\u2019t nail, but it\u2019s definitely very celebratory. I think I gave up a lot of the idea of who I thought I had to be and now I\u2019ve started having a lot of fun making my music.\n\nNONAME sweater. Carolina Herrera skirt and earrings. Calzedonia tights. Le Silla platforms. Mains de Vapeur pillbox hat. Christina Caruso belt.\n\nWhat allowed you to do that?\n\n\n\nAll the mental health work I was doing on myself. It was like, do I want to be having fun in my 20s? Or do I want to feel constantly afraid of myself, afraid of messing up, paralyzed by fear, like I don\u2019t even move? Or do I want to look back and be like, \u201cOh, I really fucked around and found out\u201d? That was part of it. But also, I fell in love. Suddenly, you have a totally new chapter that you\u2019re writing about that just didn\u2019t exist a few months ago.\n\n\u201cI gave up a lot of the idea of who I thought I had to be and I\u2019ve started having a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nIs this the point in the interview where we get to talk about the boyfriend1? Because I\u2019m dying to get into it. How did you meet?\n\nThe first time was at the 2022 VMAs and his band and I were both up for the same award.2 You just run into different artists backstage, and when I met them, I don\u2019t think I even spoke to Damiano. I didn\u2019t think anything of it. I went about my night. I\u2019d just won a VMA. And then a couple months later, their team had reached out to me about coming to their album release and I couldn\u2019t make it work with the dates, but I was like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s so sweet that they thought about me. We only met once.\u201d At one point, the band and I had been thinking about doing a collaboration. They had recorded something, so I went in and I recorded over that track. They\u2019d asked me to open for them on their tour and I couldn\u2019t make it happen. There were just these passing-ships-in-the-night things happening. So when we met again at the 2023 VMAs, we had a reason to talk to each other.\n\nAnd when he came up to me, it felt like\u2026I don\u2019t know, a year can do a lot. It felt like it had been 10 years or something. When we had met before, he was in a very different space and I was too, so we didn\u2019t register each other at all in that way. And then he was like, \u201cWe\u2019re starting our world tour at Madison Square Garden. If you\u2019re still in town in a few days, we\u2019d love it if you came.\u201d It was super innocent. And then they invited me back to their greenroom and then we started talking and then he asked me to the after-party. And then very quickly it became \u201cLet\u2019s have dinner at 8:00 at this spot.\u201d He\u2019s a Capricorn, so he was very much like, \u201cOkay, these are my intentions.\u201d It was super honorable. He\u2019s like a 1950s gentleman, angel, teddy bear. He\u2019s the best person I\u2019ve met in my life.\n\n1. Two days before Dove and I chatted, she and Damiano had walked the Met Gala red carpet together. Rumors of her relationship with the 25-year-old singer started back in September 2023, and they attended their first public events together during Grammys weekend in February 2024. They are, unsurprisingly, very cute together.\n\n2. For the record, Dove won, and it was for Best New Artist. But I\u2019m sure they have no sense of competition about it now!\n\nHow quickly did things move after that night in the greenroom?\n\nFrom the outside, it looks like it was very hot and heavy, and it looks like it was overnight, but we had both been in situations where we were very harmed in the past and we are very sensitive people. And I think when we met, we were not looking, and it was just sort of investigating. It was like, \u201cHuh, that\u2019s interesting. That\u2019s not what I expected.\u201d And so it was very, very slow, cautious, feeling-out, interview-type questions for eight hours before it was finally like, \u201cOkay, are we holding hands now?\u201d I remember I was fascinated because he presents in a way that seems very easily digestible and then you spend two minutes around him and you realize he is the kindest, most generous, most innocent, most giving person. He\u2019s just a beautiful, sensitive soul.\n\n\u201cRed flags in the beginning are red flags forever. They don\u2019t go away.\u201d\n\nI love when people surprise you. But like you said, you had both experienced some harm in past relationships. What did you learn from those instances that you were able to take into this?\n\nRed flags in the beginning are red flags forever. They don\u2019t go away. I\u2019ve been in so many relationships where my actual standing in the relationship or even my physical safety was threatened because I acted in a way that was not in their expectations of me, and the expectations would be so fucking thin. I wish I had spoken about what was going on in those relationships to my community, who would\u2019ve pulled me out. If a boyfriend\u2019s ever telling you, \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone what goes on between us,\u201d call your mom right now. Call your fucking mom.\n\nIf it feels wrong, it\u2019s wrong. And when it feels safe and you feel calm\u2026and your partner is your friend first\u2026then it\u2019s right, for the most part.\n\nI had a friend who told me once, \u201cI\u2019ll know that I\u2019m in the right relationship when it\u2019s exciting.\u201d And I remember thinking, I\u2019ll know that I\u2019m in the right relationship when I feel safe. Once you can fully be yourself and you know your partner accepts you completely, that is so liberating. It\u2019s freedom.\n\nThe funny thing, too, is that our brains tell us the exciting thing is first, and then it gets safe, and then it gets boring and it\u2019s like this sugar crash. I actually think that the safety that you build together allows for the solid ground, and then it\u2019s all exciting.\n\nExactly. That\u2019s where the good stuff is. What do you think it is about Damiano that helped you find that?\n\nI\u2019ve been spending time with him and all of his friends and his brother, and they are incredibly sensitive, incredibly romantic, incredibly emotional, very caretaking, equal parts masculine, feminine, equal parts nurturing and protecting. And I wouldn\u2019t say that American men aren\u2019t, but that\u2019s just something I\u2019ve overwhelmingly noticed in Italy. There\u2019s a certain balance between masculine and feminine that is very attractive to me as someone who dates men and women. It feels whole to me.\n\n\n\nAnd I\u2019m sure that helps you honor your own queerness in your relationship.\n\nTotally, oh my god. What\u2019s beautiful, too, is that when we met, my coming out was happening. So how he knew me was through the lens of my queer identity. And as my partner, he is very, very supportive. I\u2019ve never felt invalidated by dating him as a straight man. I\u2019ve always felt like he saw me as my full self and for my identity, while also not feeling threatened or diminished by that.\n\n\u201cI have empathy because I believe we can get there\u2014that the conversation is only going to be furthered by humanizing everyone.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a few years since you came out, and this is the first relationship you\u2019ve been in publicly since then. How do you deal with people\u2019s expectations of what your relationship can or should look like? Who your partner \u201cshould\u201d be?3\n\nA year and a half ago, it would\u2019ve completely made me spiral to have people question my identity. But I try to allow for as much empathy and understanding for people who do not know what they don\u2019t know, which is not to say there isn\u2019t room to grow. That\u2019s why I have empathy, because I believe that we can get there. I believe that the conversation is only going to be furthered by humanizing everyone. The conversation about not understanding how I can be bisexual and have a straight boyfriend, I have more patience for it. People are scared of what they don\u2019t understand, and so they try to put a label on something and they make it smaller so that they feel like they can hold it and see it and touch it and smell it.\n\n3. Dove has also dealt with past accusations of queerbaiting in her music, to which she responds: \u201cIt would be such a wild, wild backflip to change the course of your whole life for a radio hit.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd being in a public relationship, in some ways, invites all these unsolicited opinions. What did the conversations around \u201cgoing public\u201d in your relationship look like? As a regular person who has never had to think about that, I\u2019m always curious.\n\nWe\u2019re also regular people. At one point, some paparazzi photos got leaked. We went back to the hotel room and we were like, \u201cWell. Fuck, I guess.\u201d I think in the pap photos we were kissing, and both of us had never been in that situation. There\u2019s no handbook for how to handle this. We were pretty casual at that point. So it was, do we trust that this is going to go right? We didn\u2019t know. So we went about it in the most sane way we could think of, which is just leave it. Live our lives, but live them mostly quietly.\n\nScanlan Theodore shirt. Leset stirrup leggings. Roger Vivier slingback pumps. Kangol beret. B-Low the Belt chain belt.\n\nHow do you navigate putting all that into the work? I know a lot of artists take issue with fans paternity-testing their lyrics to see who they\u2019re about.\n\nThis is my approach: If it is in service to the story, no detail should be left out. If it is about spite or revenge, then that\u2019s ugly, and I wouldn\u2019t go there. That being said, you get into a sticky zone where if it\u2019s vague enough, they might blame the person that you\u2019re dating now. So it\u2019s interesting to try to navigate, because now people are like, timeline, DNA testing, fingerprints\u2026.\n\nWhat\u2019s that Real Housewives of Salt Lake City line? \u201cReceipts, proof, timeline, screenshots!\u201d\n\nYeah, exactly. Some artists write so much that they can have an album come out every six months, and so it\u2019s easier to keep up with. Obviously, we have our icon, queen of the world Taylor Swift, who is writing in real time all the time. And so it\u2019s very easy for us to sort of be like, \u201cOh, this was so and so, this was so and so.\u201d As songwriters, you have to use your own judgment. Most of my new album is love songs. It\u2019s going to be very obvious. It\u2019s literally talking about speaking Italian and meeting his mother, and you look like Freddie Mercury. I\u2019m not hiding anything.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not hiding anything\u201d seems like it could be the title of your memoir right now. What kind of mentality shift got you to this place where, as you said earlier, you\u2019re fucking around to find out?\n\nWhen I was younger, I wasn\u2019t very realistic. I wanted to bend time and space and my body and my health to my will just to get everything done. Now I\u2019ve returned to this viewpoint where it\u2019s like, maybe I can be unrealistic now. Maybe I can be delusional now. Do we tell ourselves what\u2019s realistic? Do we set those parameters? Are we the ones projecting our own limitations? So I think at some point I started to get in my own head, and now I feel renewed. Things are only impossible until you redefine the possible.\n\nLead image: Posse cardigan. Anna October bralette.
