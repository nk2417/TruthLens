Impact Link\n\nThe much-anticipated fourth season of \"Bachelor in Paradise\" is set to premiere on Monday, after a misconduct scandal threatened to not only cancel the show, but forever change ABC's long-running hit \"Bachelor\" franchise going forward.\n\nEven though an investigation into the incident by show producer Warner Bros. concluded that that there was no misconduct, there continues to be more to the story.\n\nThe alleged \"sexual misconduct\" incident occurred in early June while taping in Mexico. It temporarily shut down production, but has since resumed after Warner Bros. wrapped its investigation.\n\nBut both \"Bachelor in Paradise\" contestants who are at the center of the scandal, DeMario Jackson and Corinne Olympios, have claimed that they're victims and have sought legal counsel. They've since announced their continuing participation with the show.\n\nHow did we get here? and what's next?
