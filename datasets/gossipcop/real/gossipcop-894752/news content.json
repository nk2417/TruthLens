Teen Mom OG\u2018s Ryan Edwards and Mackenzie Standifer got married for the second time on Saturday, November 18.\n\nRelated: Teen Mom Stars, Then and Now! It\u2019s been quite a journey for the cast of Teen Mom. The series launched in December 2009 as the first spinoff from MTV\u2019s 16 and Pregnant. The debut season followed the lives of Maci Bookout, Catelynn Lowell, Amber Portwood and Farrah Abraham, who all experienced very different journeys during their teen pregnancies. On season 5, [\u2026]\n\nE! News reports that the pair, who secretly tied the knot in May, a day before Edwards headed to rehab, wed in a church ceremony that Standifer told E! was their \u201coriginal, intended\u201d celebration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been in the works since the day we got engaged,\u201d she told E! \u201cIt was never just decided upon \u2014 we knew from day one this was going to be it.\u201d\n\nStandifer said that Edwards\u2019 ex-fiance, Maci Bookout, had been invited to the wedding and the pair\u2019s son, Bentley, 9, didn\u2019t know that she and his dad were already married.\n\nEdwards proposed to Standifer over a romantic meal in December 2016, which was shown in an episode of Teen Mom OG that aired earlier this year.\n\nRelated: Celebrities Who Have Been to Rehab The perils of fame: struggling with painful pasts, overnight success and other demons, countless A-listers -- from former child stars like Lindsay Lohan to Oscar winners like Robert Downey Jr. -- have sought help at rehab.

Before they were red-carpet regulars, NeNe Leakes, Jennifer Hudson, Julianne Hough and Lucy Hale were among those who broke through as reality stars\n\nIn June, Edwards addressed his recovery in a statement to Us, saying, \u201cA little over 30 days ago, I made the decision to check myself into a rehabilitation facility. I am back home now doing well, and life could not be better. Without the support of my wife and parents I would not have been able to do this.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/icon-applenews-r.svg",
