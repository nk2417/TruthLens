The couple, who got married on Sept. 14, 2013, announced on June 28 that they quietly welcomed a baby boy that month via surrogate \u2014 adding to their brood of adorable children. Since then, the pair have been sharing glimpses of their family on social media, from their sweet vacation photos to wrangling their rambunctious kids for family portraits.\n\nOver the years, Teigen and Legend have become a fan-favorite celebrity couple, and once you add their precious children into the mix, they're almost too cute to handle as a family unit. Legend and Teigen welcomed their first child, daughter Luna, in 2016, and their son, Miles, followed in 2018. The pair frequently post about their children on Instagram and have been transparent about their parenthood journeys too. \"I'm an open, free spirit and I love kids to be kids,\" Teigen previously told People of her parenting outlook. \"For us, kindness is such a big thing. When you meet our kids, they're very warm and friendly. You instill those things in them, but for the most part let them be creative and wondrous and spirited and curious beings.\"\n\nTeigen shares all facets of her life with fans and is very open about her family. After announcing her pregnancy at the end of Legend's music video for \"Wild\" in August 2020, Teigen opened up a month later about being on bed rest due to a weak placenta. After being hospitalized due to pregnancy complications, Teigen later revealed that she and Legend lost their baby boy at about 20 weeks (it was later revealed that Teigen had to have a lifesaving abortion). They named him Jack.\n\n\"We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we've never felt before,\" she wrote on Instagram at the time. \"To our Jack - I'm so sorry that the first few moments of your life were met with so many complications, that we couldn't give you the home you needed to survive. We will always love you.\"\n\nTwo years later, via an Instagram post shared on Aug. 3, 2022, Teigen revealed that she and her husband were expecting another addition to their family, a daughter named Esti Maxine Stephens, whom they welcomed on Jan. 3. Legend announced their baby girl's arrival to a crowd at a private concert, calling the occasion \"a blessed day.\"\n\nA month after their daughter's arrival, on Feb. 15, the couple shared the first portrait of their expanded family on Instagram, with the pair and their first three kids sporting Valentine's Day-themed colors. \"excuse the spit up!! we are doing the best we can over here lol,\" Teigen joked in a caption. Meanwhile, in his own post, Legend wrote, \"I had the best Valentine's dates last night. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.\"\n\nThey doubled down on the group photo with a new one on March 1, but Teigen admitted she already has a new goal: \"all of us AND all the animals (poodle, frenchie, something I dunno terrier, basset hound, two bunnies and bearded dragon, prob something else by the time this loads).\"\n\nGet to know Teigen and Legend's cute kiddos ahead, and see some of their sweetest family photos.", "images": ["https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/ewxAjJCThsOjJG1s2VIsLYwdOYQ=/0x89:4978x2702/fit-in/4979x3319/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2023/08/14/804/n/1922398/58755ef064da700e2d6d29.95530803_.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/KVS9nZ-yozMFiIpKO_Dxk4Gyijo=/0x159:1440x1599/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2024/03/18/670/n/1922441/142aeb9565f8582f5afa85.99853425_.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/4QbIKjzGBQUEf-d30dHcipLcaUk=/0x133:2000x2133/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2023/04/20/799/n/1922398/f7cf6b6f6441801e334540.91504113_.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/2TF-Xawhsgf1WRI52heAAV-x6Y0=/0x0:1989x1989/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2023/11/03/821/n/1922398/e5c0640665453f42cac584.07542780_.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/74yIZ2beK7-rP11_cJzVJOUNDCI=/0x162:2248x2410/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2023/11/03/841/n/48559979/96768ff9654545ee326267.21501859_.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/iwKTn8kFG5E4ii6Xbya9E4ec_RU=/0x0:2694x1534/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2023/08/01/865/n/1922794/c15484f964c960fe49ae47.63399503_.png", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/1YGv8ydHCwOE1LkbUaQ_HEpfLvw=/957x0:4276x3319/fit-in/792x528/top/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2023/08/14/804/n/1922398/58755ef064da700e2d6d29.95530803_.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/HiCyQcgCqY-q3KY7aum85set-1s=/304x0:1405x1101/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2019/05/02/746/n/24155406/cb21782d5ccb210a2a1f63.30934869_.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/q_0aZ0Ba4AFPoMSBePsg_SaVqsE=/309x0:2680x2371/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2023/11/07/818/n/1922398/7c94e83f654a844d482e21.97968411_.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/aUbTHjv3-Lpf51V1EV99tSk_YVE=/0x0:1456x1456/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2024/06/06/819/n/24155406/364c076d6662028872beb2.62276943_.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/Yff9jj_1rnMmGm_ruZuycBtC33o=/672x0:3744x3072/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2023/11/03/830/n/1922398/ce7a125c65454236efecc0.81668827_.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/6eCr0P4BMk_4Htx0R_jmqj4h-Bw=/0x0:2401x2401/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2023/05/12/654/n/1922398/2ea1d918645e5042aa5089.97155152_.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/6RGr3eMjYeH3kCJw5uHLCb8SJxo=/658x0:3858x3200/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2023/06/19/347/n/48559432/9ef3f32d649001a36c2745.74285329_.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/WKcZhix946HKkpTQX0GYPgUdLYc=/1280x897:3876x3493/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2023/07/11/780/n/1922398/121b32a264ad94d4654e83.17213755_.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/NIl6dAdQXHXITPfV7L7NIrgNsis=/787x0:4255x3468/116x116/filters:format_auto():extract_cover()/2021/04/09/025/n/46902964/5a32219d6070e523975ad2.10702654_.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/ewxAjJCThsOjJG1s2VIsLYwdOYQ=/0x89:4978x2702/fit-in/4979x3319/top/filters:format_auto():quality(85):upscale()/2023/08/14/804/n/1922398/58755ef064da700e2d6d29.95530803_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alessia Santoro", "Updated On Aug", "At Pm"], "canonical_link": "https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/how-many-kids-do-chrissy-teigen-john-legend-have-46225953", "title": "John Legend Shares Adorable Milestone From 7-Month-Old Daughter Esti", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "keywords": "popsugar, alessia santoro, celebrity, john legend, celebrity kids, chrissy teigen, celebrity families, luna stephens, miles stephens", "robots": "max-image-preview:large, follow, index", "bingbot": "nocache", "google-site-verification": "-ULnbgnS51gqvbNlz7JAhFDpYe74n2hhzpfc4KXeONA", "description": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend share four adorable children: Luna, Miles, Esti, and newborn baby Wren.
