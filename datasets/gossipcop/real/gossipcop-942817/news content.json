Colour, we must admit we were rather distracted from the celebrations by the sight of Kate Middleton\u2019s Cinderella-like pale blue Alexander McQueen dress and Meghan Markle\u2019s bespoke creation by designer Carolina Herrera.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAs a result, we almost missed the moment Princess Charlotte accidentally slipped and fell off a step during the Royal Family\u2019s appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.\n\nGetty Images\n\nFortunately for the three-year-old, the Duchess of Cambridge was close at hand to rush and catch her after what must have been a pretty terrifying moment for the tot.\n\nRead Next\n\nGetty Images\n\nClearly shocked by what had happened, Kate and William's little girl was visibly upset, prompting her devoted mother to pick her up and comfort her.\n\nA day later the Princess was in good spirits once again as she cheered on her father, Prince William, during a charity game of polo in Tetbury, Gloucestershire.\n\n\n\nStanding on the sidelines with her famous mother and older brother, Prince George, Charlotte was spotted enjoying the hot weather, practicing her headstands and donning a pair of pink sunglasses, much to the delight of her mother.\n\nGetty Images\n\nGetty Images\n\nAlso present at the day out was Savannah Phillips, the seven-year-old daughter of William\u2019s first cousin Peter Phillips, who became the talk of the Trooping the Colour after placing her hand over her cousin George\u2019s mouth as he gasped at the flypast.\n\nGetty Images\n\nWe're glad to see no harm came to Princess Charlotte during her balcony fall.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-970340204-1528555888.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0.134xh&resize=300:*",
