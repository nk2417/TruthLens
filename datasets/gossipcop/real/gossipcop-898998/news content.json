The song was produced by Mr. Porter and built around a sample of Cheech & Chong\u2019s rock pastiche, \u201cEarache My Eye.\u201d\n\n\u201cFeels like we\u2019re stuck in a time warp to me/ As I kick these facts and get these mixed reactions/ As this beat backspins/ It like we\u2019re drifting back into the Sixties/ Having black skin is risky \u2019cause this keeps happening,\u201d Eminem says. \u201cThroughout history, African Americans have been treated like shit/ And I admit, there have been times where it\u2019s been embarrassing to be a white boy.\u201d\n\nIn the third verse of \u201cUntouchable,\u201d after the energetic Cheech & Chong sample subsides, Eminem delivers a sprawling narrative from the perspective of the black community \u2013 \u201cWhy is there black neighborhoods?/ \u2018Cause America segregated us/ Designated us to an area/ Separated us/ Section-eight\u2019d us\u201d \u2013 and criticized bad cops who \u201cfuck it up for good cops.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust keep marching, til\u2019 we reach Congress/ But they gonna say you\u2019re tying to take an irrational stance cause you try to slander the flag/ But somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb,\u201d Eminem said. \u201cSo they call it a Kaepernick tantrum if you don\u2019t stand for the national anthem.\u201d\n\nIn addition to \u201cUntouchable,\u201d Eminem also unveiled the album cover for Revival, with the rapper ruefully burying his head in his hand behind an unfurled American flag. Revival, due out December 15th, features guests like Ed Sheeran, Pink and Alicia Keys as well as \u201cWalk on Water\u201d collaborator Beyonce.\n\nThe best from the bloody, bombastic, brilliant career of the hip-hop troublemaker.
