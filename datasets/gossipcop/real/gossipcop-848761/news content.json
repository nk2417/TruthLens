Tre Davis, Nigel Thatch and Melissa Roxburgh. The series came from executive producers Bill Haber, Anna Fricke and Kyle Jarrow, and was a co-production from CBS Television Studios and Warner Bros. Television.\n\n\u201cValor\u201d debuted on the CW\u2019s fall 2018 schedule but failed to receive the back-nine pickup. Its season concluded in late January 2018 with an average of 958,000 total viewers and a rating of 0.21 in the 18-49 demo. \u201cValor\u201d actually beat the CW\u2019s freshman series \u201cDynasty\u201d in the ratings (that latter series is averaging 697,000 total viewers and 0.19 in the demo). However, \u201cDynasty\u201d was among the 10 series the network renewed back in April.\n\nThis comes on the heals of the CW\u2019s midseason freshman drama \u201cLife Sentence\u201d getting canceled.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nThe CW has renewed 11 series for the 2018-19 television season. In addition to the aforementioned \u201cDynasty,\u201d the other returning series are \u201cSupernatural,\u201d \u201cCrazy Ex-Girlfriend,\u201d \u201cJane The Virgin,\u201d \u201cBlack Lightning,\u201d \u201cThe Flash,\u201d \u201cSupergirl,\u201d \u201cDC\u2019s Legends of Tomorrow,\u201d \u201cArrow,\u201d \u201cRiverdale\u201d and \u201cThe 100.\u201d", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/val113c_0149b.jpg?w=1000&h=667&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/val113c_0149b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C676px&resize=1000%2C563", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/val113c_0149b.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C676px&resize=1000%2C563", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Danielle Turchiano", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/valor-canceled-cw-1202800360/", "title": "\u2018Valor\u2019 Canceled by CW After One Season", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"Valor\" has been canceled by the CW after one season.
