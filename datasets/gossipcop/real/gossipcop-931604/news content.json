Years before marrying Barr, Arnold says he had a short-lived fling with Metcalf in the heat of the moment.\n\nThe 59-year-old actor was a gust on The Howard Stern Show on Wednesday where he opened up about his dating life during the early days of Roseanne. Arnold, who was an actor and writer on the TV series from the late \u201980s until the early \u201990s, told Stern that he had a brief romance with co-star Metcalf during the filming of the show\u2019s pilot episode.\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\n\u201cThe night we shot the pilot, yes, Roseanne was in the front seat getting romantic with John Goodman. I was in the backseat. Roseanne looks back and I\u2019m holding hands with Laurie Metcalf and then we\u2019re having a great time,\u201d Arnold said.\n\n\u201cWe went to the Improv, we were just hammered. The next morning [Barr] calls me into her office and she goes, \u2018Tom, I was a writer too. Writers cannot date the actors. That\u2019s the rule of Hollywood,\u2019\u201d Arnold shared. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, OK\u2026I apologize. That\u2019s the rule of Hollywood I would not violate it.\u2019 And then I couldn\u2019t date Laurie Metcalf. And little did I know Roseanne would eventually make me marry her\u2026I could never tell how women like me but apparently if they\u2019re really, really mean to me\u2026I appreciated that.\u201d\n\nBut Arnold revealed that while sparks definitely flew between him and Metfcalf, there was nothing more to the fun night.\n\n\u201cWell, no, we had a night\u2026it\u2019s like I\u2019m sure we were out partying, we did a pilot for a TV show, this is exciting\u2026well whatever\u2026there was something that night, 100 percent,\u201d Arnold revealed. \u201cOf course I don\u2019t know what. Well they kissed and made out\u2026well, whatever they want\u2026well they were backing down in a car, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nArnold went on to tie the knot with Barr in 1990, but the couple divorced four years later. While long-standing tension still exists between Barr and Arnold, he penned a full-length review of the show\u2019s revival season and said he was pleasantly surprised.\n\n\u201cThe world is different now than when Roseanne and I went to Bill Clinton\u2019s inauguration in 1992, and a lot has changed since the show went off the air in 1997,\u201d he began his lengthy post for The Hollywood Reporter, adding that when he learned about the reboot he was \u201chappy for Roseanne and the other actors.\u201d\n\nHe continued, saying he \u201cknew the new show\u2019s success would rest on one thing: Who will Roseanne Conner be in 2018?\u201d before elaborating on her outspoken pro-Donald Trump political views.\n\nArnold went on to write that when he \u201cread on the internet that Roseanne Conner was going to be a far-right Trump lover,\u201d and that the show \u201cwould now be more about Sara Gilbert\u2019s character, Darlene, and that Roseanne\u2019s role wouldn\u2019t be that big of a deal,\u201d he didn\u2019t think it sounded good.\n\nHe detailed his reaction to the premiere episode titled \u201cTwenty Years to Life,\u201d including the revelation that Dan Conner is alive despite \u201cwhat everyone assumed was a fatal heart attack in the 1997 series finale,\u201d and he praised the performances of Barr and John Goodman.\n\n\u201c[They] haven\u2019t skipped a beat,\u201d he wrote. \u201cReboots have to be tough to write because they aren\u2019t pilots, but they kind of are, so you have to introduce your characters to new people but not over-introduce them to fans. But honestly, once my eyes adjusted a bit, the cold open could be from the \u201990s.\u201d\n\nHe told fans of the original show that the reboot is \u201cas good as it\u2019s going to get.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Barr] has done everything from pulling my hair transplants immediately after surgery to saying I had a 3-inch penis on SNL, so I figure if I can give the show another shot, maybe other people could too,\u201d he wrote.", "images": ["https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/molly-dangerously-obese.png?w=300", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8568956&cj=1", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/05/robert-irwin.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/themes/popculture-2024/assets/images/popculture-logo-white.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/04/1c80a318-ac01-429c-ae50-dcd1a2e17f40.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/10/boston-blue-faith-and-family-sonequa-martin-green-donnie-wahlberg-cbs.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/10/PopCulture-logo_1f401e.png", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/04/70839b1d-3826-4242-9848-ca2fff9b687f.jpg?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/04/45511bc5-8791-4d0b-a2e9-34e9c9011b24.png?w=300", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2025/11/cma-awards-getty.jpg?w=300", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-RxPFZR-mKeJrq.gif", "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2024/07/70afec6a-3143-4947-b047-428e525611d4.jpg?w=300"], "top_img": "https://popculture.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2021/03/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657.png?w=640", "keywords": [], "authors": [".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Secondary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm", "Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Bold", "Line-Height Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Line-Height--Xxs", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline A Font-Weight Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Weight--Black", "Text-Decoration None", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Family Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Family--Primary", "Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Tiny", "Media Min-Width", ".Wp-Block-Savage-Platform-Post-Byline Font-Size Var --Wp--Custom--Typography--Font-Size--Sm"], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/tom-arnold-claims-he-briefly-romanced-laurie-metcalf-before-roseanne-barr/", "title": "Tom Arnold Claims He Briefly Romanced Laurie Metcalf Before Roseanne Barr", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Tom Arnold Claims He Briefly Romanced Laurie Metcalf Before Roseanne Barr", "description": "An off-screen romance web was tangled up between Roseanne Barr, Tom Arnold and Laurie Metcalf during the early days of Roseanne.
