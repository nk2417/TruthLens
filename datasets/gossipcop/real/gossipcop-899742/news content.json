He took a financial hit with all this,\u201d the source says. \u201cAnnette\u2019s going to get a lot of money. Everybody\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s going to have to give her the horse farm. That\u2019s her love.\u201d\n\nIn August, it was reported that Lauer could pay Roque up to $20 million in the settlement and that they agreed to share custody of sons Jack, 17, and Thijs, 11, and daughter Romy, 14.\n\nAlthough the former couple\u2019s relationship is coming to an end, Lauer has continued to live on the property where his wife of 20 years and three children are living in the Hamptons. But once the divorce papers are signed, the source says Lauer will likely get his own place.\n\n\u201cEventually the plan is that he will move out of the house,\u201d the source says. \u201cHe\u2019s at the compound, living in the guest house, and he sees the kids. It\u2019s still the same setup for now. It\u2019ll continue that way until early next year.\u201d\n\nKevin Mazur/Getty\n\nMoving forward, Lauer and Roque have decided to put their difference aside for the sake of their children.\n\n\u201cHe and Annett are co-parenting,\u201d a second source adds. \u201cThey\u2019re just all business. They have to talk and they even spend some time together as a family, but when they do it\u2019s not about them it\u2019s about the children.\u201d\n\nLauer and Roque, 51, wed in 1998 after meeting on a blind date.\n\nIn the wake of Lauer\u2019s firing, several insiders told PEOPLE that the anchor was allegedly often unfaithful to Roque.\n\n\u201cBy Matt\u2019s own admission there were struggles and challenges with his wife,\u201d one source said. \u201cLike many couples, they struggled with a modern marriage.\u201d\n\nIn May, NBC released a report about the Lauer\u2019s firing. The internal investigation, which was led by NBCUniversal general counsel Kim Harris, focused on four complainants\u2019 allegations and resulted from nearly 70 interviews with current and former employees and more than 30 focus groups with 262 current employees. According to The New York Times, one complaint included a former NBC employee who alleged Lauer sexually assaulted her in his office in 2001.\n\nIn the first paragraphs of the report, the investigation team states that Lauer \u201cadmitted to engaging in sexual activity\u201d with the anonymous woman whose allegations prompted his firing.\n\nLauer also admitted to \u2014 and apologized for \u2014 seeing NBC staffers romantically during his tenure at the network.\n\n\u201cFive months ago I was terminated by NBC after admitting to past relationships with co-workers. A day later I took responsibility, apologized to the people I had hurt and promised to begin the process of repairing the damage I had caused my family. I have worked every day since then to honor that promise,\u201d he said in a statement to PEOPLE in April.\n\n\u201cI have made no public comments on the many false stories from anonymous or biased sources that have been reported about me over these past several months \u2013 including a claim that I would, or even could, lock someone in my office. I remained silent in an attempt to protect my family from further embarrassment and to restore a small degree of the privacy they have lost,\u201d Lauer continued.\n\n\u201cBut defending my family now requires me to speak up. I fully acknowledge that I acted inappropriately as a husband, father and principal at NBC. However I want to make it perfectly clear that any allegations or reports of coercive, aggressive or abusive actions on my part, at any time, are absolutely false,\u201d he concluded.", "images":
