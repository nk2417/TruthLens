The network on Sunday will air a 12-hour marathon of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations.\n\nThe show, which ran for nine seasons from 2005-2012, won the Emmy for outstanding cinematography for nonfiction programming in 2009 and 2011. In all, Bourdain filmed 142 episodes. According to a Friday press release, Travel Channel will air \u201ccelebrated episodes,\u201d including Bourdain\u2019s memorable journey to Spain\u2019s Costa Brava and his exploration of Laos. On Monday afternoon, the network announced that it will continue to play beloved episodes of No Reservations every Tuesday night at 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. until July 3.\n\nTravel Channel shared its sorrow over Bourdain\u2019s death in a Twitter statement: \u201cWe are stunned and deeply saddened to hear that the world is now without its global ambassador, Anthony Bourdain. He was an incredible talent who showed us beautiful, gritty, complicated and delicious places in every corner of the world. His wit and perspective will be missed. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.\u201d\n\nCNN, the network behind Bourdain\u2019s other critically acclaimed series, Parts Unknown, also revealed plans to honor the late food enthusiast and TV personality in programming over the weekend. The network on Friday night will air a special tribute, Remembering Anthony Bourdain, and a night of Bourdain\u2019s favorite episodes of Parts Unknown will run on Saturday.\n\nOn Sunday, CNN will air a previously scheduled episode of Parts Unknown, in which Bourdain ventures into Berlin, with a special introduction from Anderson Cooper. An encore of Remembering Anthony Bourdain will play immediately after.\n\nBourdain was found dead in his hotel room in France after an apparent suicide, CNN confirmed early Friday. Though Bourdain appeared to have hanged himself, his exact cause of death is still under investigation. \u201cWe have indeed learned of the death by hanging of the American chef this morning in a luxury hotel in Kaysersberg, Le Chambard,\u201d said Colmar\u2019s public prosecutor Christian de Rocquigny du Fayel in a statement. \u201cAt this stage, nothing suggests the intervention of a third party.\u201d\n\nJune 11, 1:56 p.m. Updated with the Travel Channel\u2019s plans to air No Reservations every Tuesday night until July 3.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/39e82c1c-e265-40f6-8381-f3df2dbdf0fc.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/39e82c1c-e265-40f6-8381-f3df2dbdf0fc.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evan Real", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/anthony-bourdain-travel-channel-sets-no-reservations-marathon-1118567/", "title": "Travel Channel Sets Marathon of \u2018No Reservations\u2019 in Tribute to Anthony Bourdain", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Travel Channel on Sunday will pay tribute to the late Anthony Bourdain with a 12-hour marathon of his 'Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations.'", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Evan Real", "tags": "Anthony Bourdain, nsfs, THRX", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Travel Channel Sets Marathon of \u2018No Reservations\u2019 in Tribute to Anthony Bourdain", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/anthony-bourdain-travel-channel-sets-no-reservations-marathon-1118567/", "description": "Travel Channel on Sunday will pay tribute to the late Anthony Bourdain with a 12-hour marathon of his 'Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations.'", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/39e82c1c-e265-40f6-8381-f3df2dbdf0fc.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 576, "alt": "Anthony Bourdain: Travel Channel Sets 'No Reservations' Marathon"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-08T14:43:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2023-04-17T22:07:09+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Travel Channel on Sunday will pay tribute to the late Anthony Bourdain with a 12-hour marathon of his 'Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations.'", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Travel Channel Sets Marathon of \u2018No Reservations\u2019 in Tribute to Anthony Bourdain", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/39e82c1c-e265-40f6-8381-f3df2dbdf0fc.png?w=1280&h=720&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528468985.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
