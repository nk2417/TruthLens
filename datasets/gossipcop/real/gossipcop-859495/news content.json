The news came a decade after she had her first child, son Dezi James, with ex Eric Calvo.\n\n\u201cDoing it 10 years older [is] really night and day!\u201d Pressly admits, saying she feels \u201c10 years wiser\u201d and describing the feeling of carrying two children compared to one, \u201cHaving eight limbs moving around is something very alien.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more discomfort than there was with one,\u201d she adds. \u201cI\u2019ve had a fairly easy pregnancy considering so many women go through so much worse, so I\u2019ve been very, very lucky.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

I\u2019m not a sweet-tooth person, I\u2019m a savory, and I\u2019ve really been craving sweets, which is unusual for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was bloated everywhere and all of a sudden went out and [it] just went straight into my belly, so I\u2019m all belly [now],\u201d says the star. \u201cBut I worked out \u2026 and then I had to slow down a little bit.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about how Dezi is adjusting, Pressly reveals he\u2019s \u201cso excited\u201d about the idea of becoming a big brother. \u201cHe\u2019s been begging for a sibling since kindergarten,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about time!\u201d\n\nJerod Harris/WireImage\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be nice that they have a built-in buddy,\u201d Pressly says. \u201cBecause having an only child for 10 years is proving to be a little more difficult than I thought \u2014 only because you have to constantly entertain [them] or find a play date. Whereas now with twins, it comes with a play date.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted a girl, but boys love their mamas and I\u2019m a tomboy anyway, so it\u2019s kind of fitting,\u201d adds the My Name Is Earl alum.\n\nBut she\u2019s not spilling the beans on what she\u2019s naming her twins. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna wait to tell them until after,\u201d Pressly says before teasing,\u201dthey start with Ls.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Watch Jennifer Lopez Tear Up Remembering Her Twins Being Born\n\nPressly is currently starring on Mom, where the writers of the show incorporated her weight gain into a character arc about overeating.\n\nHer character Jill miscarried last season and decided to sponsor a foster child to fill the void. However, learning that she may lose the child to its biological mother caused her to \u201cemotionally eat,\u201d the actress explained to EW.\n\nPressly will appear in seven episodes this fall before going on maternity leave. She\u2019s expected to deliver her twin boys around Nov. 5, and will return to the sitcom in January.\n\nMom returns to CBS on Thursday, Nov. 2, at 9 p.m. ET.", "images":
