County Sheriff's Office confirmed to ET that a sexual battery report was filed with Malibu/Lost Hills Station detectives against the singer, alleging that an incident had taken place in 2016.\n\nThe accuser, actress Tracey Birdsall alleged to TMZ that in 2016, she was returning a salad spinner to Seal, when she claimed he attempted to force himself on her and groped her breasts.\n\nAt the time, a rep for Seal told ET, \"Seal vehemently denies the recent accusations made against him by a former neighbor for alleged misconduct of more than a year ago. He intends to vigorously defend himself against these false allegations.\"\n\nJust days before the allegations came to light, Seal caused some controversy on social media, calling out Hollywood hypocrisy with a past photo of Oprah Winfrey kissing Harvey Weinstein on the cheek, before later clarifying that he has \"enormous respect\" for her.\n\nWatch the video below for more.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2024-01/GettyImages-1455624703.jpg?h=a8c9c80a&width=753&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/seal_gettyimages-879582818.jpg?h=059625fd", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-01/seal_gettyimages-879582818.jpg?h=059625fd&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_showclip_sealoprah_011118.jpg?h=d1cb525d&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/seal_gettyimages-879582818.jpg?h=059625fd&width=1024&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2018-01/seal_oprah_getty.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=256&quality=75"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/seal_gettyimages-879582818.jpg?h=059625fd", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/seals-sexual-battery-case-rejected-by-los-angeles-district-attorney-96248", "title": "Seal's Sexual Battery Case Rejected by Los Angeles District Attorney", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/seal_gettyimages-879582818.jpg?h=059625fd", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The 54-year-old singer has 'vehemently' denied accusations made against him by a former neighbor.", "title": "Seal's Sexual Battery Case Rejected by Los Angeles District Attorney", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/seals-sexual-battery-case-rejected-by-los-angeles-district-attorney-96248", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The 54-year-old singer has 'vehemently' denied accusations made against him by a former neighbor.", "twitter": {"description": "The 54-year-old singer has 'vehemently' denied accusations made against him by a former neighbor.", "title": "Seal's Sexual Battery Case Rejected by Los Angeles District Attorney", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/seals-sexual-battery-case-rejected-by-los-angeles-district-attorney-96248", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-01/seal_gettyimages-879582818.jpg?h=059625fd", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Seal's Sexual Battery Case Rejected by Los Angeles District Attorney | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, Music, Seal", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
