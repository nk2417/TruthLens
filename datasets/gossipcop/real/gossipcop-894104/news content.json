Before joining Vox in 2016, they were a staff reporter at the Daily Dot. A 2019 fellow of the National Critics Institute, they\u2019re considered an authority on fandom, the internet, and the culture wars.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year full of unexpected voting decisions, but even the hardiest of souls was likely unprepared for People magazine to announce that the \u201cSexiest Man\u201d of 2017 is \u2026 Blake Shelton.\n\nThat\u2019s right. Blake Shelton: country singer, Voice judge, boyfriend of Gwen Stefani, and frequent purveyor of weird gay panic, misogyny, and Islamophobia.\n\nIf naming Shelton was a publicity stunt, it worked: Twitter users were so startled by the revelation that both \u201cBlake Shelton\u201d and \u201cSexiest Man Alive\u201d trended for most of Wednesday, and the jokes flowed loudly and freely:\n\nMany social media users were quick to compare Shelton\u2019s looks to things that are \u2014 how can we put this? \u2014 not sexy:\n\nOf course, People is routinely derided for its choice of Sexiest Man Alive, which is a transparently PR-driven exercise often jokingly equated to a \u201cbest publicist\u201d award. As such, each year\u2019s choice invites a wave of alternate opinions, and 2017 is no exception, with social media users being quick to point out other, sexier alternatives to Shelton:\n\nTwitter users had many opinions on who the actual sexiest men of the year were, but a general consensus seemed to form around the triad of perennially overlooked frontrunner Idris Elba, upcoming Aquaman actor Jason Momoa, and the usual gaggle of white guys named Chris:\n\nBut despite the jokes, there\u2019s plenty of reason beyond the subjective nature of sexiness to be critical of People\u2019s decision \u2014 namely because Shelton has been flagrantly and repeatedly homophobic in the past, once \u201cjoking\u201d in a 2011 tweet that he would leave any gay man who tried to touch him beaten and bloody.\n\nHe also used the stage at the Country Music Awards for an awkward gay joke about Jake Gyllenhaal because he starred in Brokeback Mountain, and has repeatedly referenced gay panic and jokes about finding lesbians hot on his Twitter account. In the past, he\u2019s made toxic jokes about women, including noting, in 2010, a \u201csick fantasy\u201d about then-16-year-old Dakota Fanning, and has repeatedly made Islamophobic and xenophobic jokes about non-English-language speakers and foreigners around him.\n\nAfter the news about Shelton\u2019s new title began circulating, many began pointing out the singer\u2019s problematic history:\n\nStill, some were quick to point out that it\u2019s not the first time People has made odd decisions in its annual Sexiest Man vote. For starters, the list has historically been overwhelmingly white, with only two men of color ever gracing its cover \u2014 Denzel Washington in 1996 and The Rock in 2016. This fact, combined with backlash over Shelton, had many onlookers pointing out how problematic the list has historically been.\n\nNot to mention how weird some of the choices have been:", "images": ["https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AlexAbad-Santos_Vox.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-590696434.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/the-true-meaning-of-friendsgiving.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=7.8125%2C0%2C84.375%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-2155209999.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0.0041883062489489%2C0%2C99.991623387502%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-2155209999.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.669458870833%2C0%2C66.661082258335%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-2217689678.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0.024402147388969%2C100%2C99.951195705222&w=2400", "https://www.google-analytics.com/g/collect?v=2&tid=G-C3QZPB4GVE&cid=555&en=noscript_page_view", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/AlexAbad-Santos_Vox.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/GettyImages-590696434.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/3_Vox_FuturePerfect25_LandingPage.gif?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/gettyimages-2217689678.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.650390625%2C0%2C66.69921875%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/the-true-meaning-of-friendsgiving.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=21.875%2C0%2C56.25%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9688379/868632848.jpg.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C5.2251516565562%2C100%2C73.293543083166&w=1200", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/3_Vox_FuturePerfect25_LandingPage.gif?quality=90&strip=all&crop=16.666666666667%2C0%2C66.666666666667%2C100&w=2400", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/author_profile_images/191459/me.0.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=96", "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9688379/868632848.jpg.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C3.3364442370509%2C100%2C93.327111525898&w=2400"], "top_img": "https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9688379/868632848.jpg.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C5.2251516565562%2C100%2C73.293543083166&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aja Romano"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/11/15/16657338/blake-shelton-sexiest-man-backlash", "title": "Blake Shelton is People magazine\u2019s \u201cSexiest Man\u201d of 2017.
