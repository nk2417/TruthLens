That wasn\u2019t easy on them.\u201d\n\nWhile Gomez \u201calways made an effort\u201d to attend his shows when she could, \u201cthat played a part in them getting distant,\u201d adds the insider. \u201cIt\u2019s over for now, but they\u2019re still in touch.\u201d\n\nThe breakup also hasn\u2019t been easy on the couple. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard for them to come to the realization that this is the direction things were heading, but it\u2019s been hard for months,\u201d says the insider, who adds that Gomez is not back together with her ex Justin Bieber.\n\nGomez was spotted spending time with Bieber \u2014 whom she dated on-and-off from 2011 to 2015 \u2014 over the weekend. The duo attended church together and were photographed by TMZ grabbing breakfast at a caf\u00e9 in Westlake Village, California, in late October.\n\nIt\u2019s been a challenging year for Gomez, who revealed in September that the reason she quietly stepped back from her career over the summer was because she was recovering from a kidney transplant.\n\nWATCH: Selena Gomez and The Weeknd Split After 10 Months Together\n\nThe Weeknd and Gomez first became linked in January, when they were spotted sharing a kiss while out on a romantic dinner date. A source told PEOPLE at the time that the budding romance was \u201cnew and nothing serious.\u201d\n\nHowever, in the months that followed, the two would flaunt their status as the picture-perfect couple. Gomez and Weeknd traveled to Italy together shortly after and even took a trip to the \u201cEarned It\u201d singer\u2019s hometown of Toronto, Canada, in March.\n\nAfter a series of sweet outings, the stars made their official debut as a couple at the Met Gala. And, most importantly, Weeknd received a stamp of approval from Gomez\u2019s mother, Mandy Teefey.\n\nThe whirlwind romance showed no signs of slowing down, with a source previously telling PEOPLE, \u201cThey\u2019re doing great together. Abel treats Selena really well and he makes her very happy.\u201d\n\nIn May, Gomez explained why she had opted to make her relationship so public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard when I would want to spend so much time hiding things,\u201d she said in an interview with On Air With Ryan Seacrest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s too much pressure, and I think everyone gets over everything eventually\u2026 I just want to be happy. If that\u2019s me just being myself, then I don\u2019t really care.\u201d", "images":
