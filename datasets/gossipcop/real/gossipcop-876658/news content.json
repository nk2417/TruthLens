That\u2019s according to People, which says that Bullock released a brief statement saying that she hopes we can rise above the current political climate and join together to help those in need. \u201cThere are no politics in eight feet of water,\u201d she says, \u201cthere are human beings in eight feet of water.\u201d (Bullock presumably missed Donald Trump\u2019s hurricane response, because he seems pretty confident that there\u2019s a ton of politics in eight feet of water.)", "images":
