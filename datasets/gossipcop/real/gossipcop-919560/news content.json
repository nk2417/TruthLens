I\u2019m embracing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had a profound and incredible season of my life on Grey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d Drew added. \u201cI got to tell stories I believed in. I got to work with [producers] Shonda Rhimes and Betsy Beers and learn from the best. I got to work with an incredible community of people that I will have lifelong friendships with. I got to build a platform and have my children in an environment where I was cared for because of who Shonda is and how she takes care of her mamas and her women. It\u2019s hard for me to come up with anything I could be angry about.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ellen Pompeo Slams Implication Her Pay Rise Led to \u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Staff Shakeup\n\nDrew left Grey\u2019s Anatomy along with fellow cast member Jessica Capshaw, who portrayed Dr. Arizona Robbins for 10 seasons.\n\nUproar on social media followed when their exits were announced, many speculating that cuts were made to compensate for series lead Ellen Pompeo\u2019s $20 million salary. Pompeo vigorously denied that, with Rhimes and executive producer/showrunner Krista Vernoff both stressing that the actress\u2019 exits were strictly creative decisions.\n\nThat\u2019s how it was described to Drew too.\n\n\u201cI was told that the show had too many characters and that they needed to downsize because they couldn\u2019t service all of the characters effectively,\u201d she said to the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want any of us to be left in the background and not getting much of a story. Because there were so many series regulars, they needed to downsize and to find some characters that they felt like they could tie up their stories well.\u201d\n\n\u201cKrista Vernoff said that she felt like April had been through so much and had come out the other side and that she didn\u2019t know what she could put her through again,\u201d Drew continued. \u201cIt was really hard to hear that. But Krista had a lot of very complimentary things to say about the work that I had done \u2014 especially this past season \u2014 and that April was going to have her happy ending.\u201d\n\nJessica Capshaw/Instagram\n\nApril\u2019s ending? Getting hitched to Matthew (Justin Bruening) and quitting her job \u2014 something Drew wasn\u2019t exactly happy with at first.\n\n\u201cIn the midst of it, I was devastated that Jackson (Jesse Williams) and April wasn\u2019t an endgame,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cI thought Jackson and April were meant to get back together and they were going to get married again and realize they\u2019d been crazy and it was just going to be this long, slow burn.\u201d\n\nLooking back on it now, though, Drew has had a change of heart.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a real sweetness to that story of April\u2019s faith,\u201d Drew said to the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cShe ran off with Jackson and loved him and wouldn\u2019t regret a single second of that relationship because it made her heart grow and she got a beautiful daughter out of it. She grew as a woman and as a person of faith. All of that had to happen. But there was something beautiful about the redemption story between April and Matthew. She hurt him worse than anybody had ever hurt him by walking away from him [at their wedding]. For there to be reconciliation from that scenario? That\u2019s a really beautiful redemption story that there could be forgiveness there. He lost his wife and then finds his first love again. It\u2019s lovely.\u201d\n\nGreg Doherty/Getty\n\nSince leaving Grey\u2019s, Drew has actually received an Emmy nomination for the series\u2018 short form offshoot B-Team, which she directed. She says the experience of learning to direct \u2014 which she was actually doing the day she learned about her departure \u2014 and getting the Emmy nomination has given her career a \u201cbeautiful rebirth.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy confidence had gotten a bit shaken in the wake of being let go and the nomination after the fact made me go, \u2018I don\u2019t need to be worried about anything or have my confidence shaken,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not only pursuing my career as an actor but I\u2019m now also walking into this world as a director and as a producer and the world is so wide open. \u2026 I don\u2019t need to be sad and I don\u2019t need to be mourning and I don\u2019t need to be in grief over the end of something that was so beautiful. I can just rise from the ashes in a more brilliant way.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Drew admitted that leaving Grey\u2019s the way she did was the right thing in the long run.\n\n\u201c[Being let go] was painful when it happened, but, in retrospect, I think it would have been hard for me to walk away from that job,\u201d she told the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cI was on it for nine years. It feels right and it feels like a good time to move on to something else with all the great love in my heart that I have for everybody and respect and gratitude for what that experience was. Playing a character for nine years is a long haul.\u201d", "images":
