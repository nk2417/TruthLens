Given the release of Ridley\u2019s latest film, The Last Jedi, in December, the game was Star Wars themed.\n\nThe game, a long-running bit on Fallon\u2019s show, has guests put on headphones and listen to loud music while Fallon says a phrase and they must read his lips. In true Star Wars fashion, Ridley\u2019s headphones were adorned with hair buns the likes of Princess Leia.\n\nThe first clue Ridley, dressed in a Ulla Johnson jumpsuit, was challenged to guess was the famous opening lines from Star Wars films, \u201cA long time ago in a galaxy far, far away \u2026\u201d The Last Jedi star was quickly able to get the last bit of the line, shouting, \u201cSomething, something, far, far away,\u201d then succeeded in guessing correctly seconds later.\n\nNext, it was Fallon\u2019s turn to try on the Leia headphones. Ridley mouthed the name \u201cLando Calrissian,\u201d the ruler of Cloud City made famous by Billy Dee Williams in 1980\u2019s The Empire Strikes Back. \u201cLactic acid,\u201d Fallon guessed, seemingly forgetting the game\u2019s Star Wars theme. After a few more off-base guesses, the host got it right. \u201cI forgot it was Star Wars themed,\u201d Fallon laughed.\n\nThe next clue Ridley had to guess was Yoda\u2019s famous inspirational quote to Luke Skywalker, \u201cDo or do not, there is no try.\u201d It took the star a few guesses, but she finally was tipped off by Fallon\u2019s Yoda-like expressions and got the answer.\n\nThe final clue was Leia\u2019s famous plea in 1977\u2019s A New Hope, \u201cHelp me, Obi Wan Kenobi, you\u2019re my only hope.\u201d After several incorrect guesses of \u201cpickle\u201d and \u201cElmo,\u201d Fallon got it right.\n\nWatch the video below.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jimmy_fallon_daisy_ridley.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jimmy_fallon_daisy_ridley.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patrick Shanley", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/daisy-ridley-plays-star-wars-themed-whisper-challenge-jimmy-fallon-1062390/", "title": "Daisy Ridley Plays Star Wars-Themed \u201cWhisper Challenge\u201d With Jimmy Fallon", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The 'Last Jedi' star dropped by the 'Tonight Show' to guess famous quotes from the legendary sci-fi films.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Patrick Shanley", "tags": "Daisy Ridley, Jimmy Fallon, The Tonight Show", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Daisy Ridley Plays Star Wars-Themed \u201cWhisper Challenge\u201d With Jimmy Fallon", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/daisy-ridley-plays-star-wars-themed-whisper-challenge-jimmy-fallon-1062390/", "description": "The 'Last Jedi' star dropped by the 'Tonight Show' to guess famous quotes from the legendary sci-fi films.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jimmy_fallon_daisy_ridley.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Daisy Ridley Plays Star Wars-Themed \"Whisper Challenge\" With Jimmy Fallon"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-28T21:30:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-04T14:31:05+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 'Last Jedi' star dropped by the 'Tonight Show' to guess famous quotes from the legendary sci-fi films.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Daisy Ridley Plays Star Wars-Themed \u201cWhisper Challenge\u201d With Jimmy Fallon", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/jimmy_fallon_daisy_ridley.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/4FgV0yBZG6E"], "publish_date": 1511904640.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
