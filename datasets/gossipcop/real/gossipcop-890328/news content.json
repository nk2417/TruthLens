Check back each week for her latest update on the competition.\n\nRelated: Meet the Season 27 \u2018DWTS\u2019 Cast Ready for the glitz and glamour! Dancing With the Stars season 27 is right around the corner, and the full list of celebrities who are set to take the dance floor was announced on Good Morning America on Wednesday, September 12. From athletes to models and all the talented contestants in between, scroll down to [\u2026]\n\nI knew that Joe and I had an Argentine Tango, and I was so excited because I\u2019ve had the perfect song I\u2019ve been trying to do for seasons. I really thought \u201cEl Tango Roxanne\u201d was perfect for Halloween night. It\u2019s creepy and intense. I wanted us to be a character, not dead zombies or something. So, I thought Mrs. and Mr. Frankenstein would be awesome and Joe would pull it off.He danced so great; this was by far Joe\u2019s best dance. I was so happy for him, especially since the judges were very complimentary, and he just had an epic performance. I think this was great for his confidence going into the next week for Country Week. We didn\u2019t want to beat around the bush. We did a pure Argentine tango, he remembered the steps and executed them really well.\n\nEveryone\u2019s journey is so different on this show and sometimes it takes people seven weeks to get good, sometimes it takes people one week. I think Joe is realizing he\u2019s doing well and understanding this process.\n\nRelated: \u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019 Winners Through the Years See pictures of every Dancing With the Stars winner through the years, from Kelly Monaco in season one to Meryl Davis in season 18\n\nDuring the last five seconds of the dance, Joe grabbed my hips in a bit of a wrong position. It was correct, but it wasn\u2019t all the way around my waist and I knew that if I flipped over, I was probably going to die. I just was like, it\u2019s Halloween night and I have to take one for the team, so I just went for it. I borderline broke my back, but I feel great. Somehow, we landed it, and I think it just made it more surprising and shocking. Sometimes, mistakes are beautiful perfections. If something goes wrong on live TV and someone\u2019s not used to performing or isn\u2019t a dancer, it\u2019s really hard to come back from that. So the fact that he kept going and was still in character and then ripped my head off at the end, I was like, \u2018What? Who is this guy? Not Joe week one! He\u2019s a dancer!\u2019\n\nNext week is Country Week. I didn\u2019t grow up with country music, but I appreciate the lyrics. Usually it\u2019s love songs or some beautiful storytelling. I think it\u2019ll be great for the show because Dancing With the Stars is all about storytelling. We\u2019ve never done a country week before, so it\u2019ll be a first for all of us. Joe and I have something fun planned. I\u2019m gonna go for Coachella vibes \u2026 or should I stay Stagecoach vibes?\n\nRelated: Most Disastrous \u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019 Partners Ever Problems in the ballroom \u2014 and backstage!
