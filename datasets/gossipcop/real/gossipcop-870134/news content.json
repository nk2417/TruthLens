With the wedding of her cheating ex, Mike \"Sugar Bear\" Thompson, coming up, the then-37-year-old reality star underwent a series of weight loss and plastic surgeries, documenting the process in a WEtv series, Mama June: From Not to Hot.The first of the seven one-hour episodes saw Mama June being wheeled into surgery. \"I'm going to look completely different,\" she promised. But \"I'm scared, too.\"\n\n02 of 20 NEXT STEPS Jamie McCarthy/Getty Surgery wasn't the last stop, though: Mama June also enlisted trainer Kenya Crooks to whip her into shape \u2014 which meant ridding her kitchen of indulgences like ice cream and candy. Though on the verge of giving up, she kept persevering, telling viewers, \"This surgery is the scariest thing I've ever done, but I mean, there is a skinnier person inside of me.\"\n\n03 of 20 THE TRANSFORMATION D Dipasupil/Getty;We TV Daughter Lauryn \"Pumpkin\" Shannon dished about her mother's changing physique, saying she actually got a gastric sleeve in May 2015, but saw her weight loss taper off. \"It came to a point where [the trainer] had to step in because she hit another plateau with the gastric sleeve, and wasn't losing any more weight,\" she explained to Entertainment Tonight. But with a decreasing number on the scale came excess skin, which Mama June had surgically removed. \"She got her boobies done,\" Pumpkin also shared. \"She got them from a 44 long to 36 up.\"\n\n04 of 20 COMING ALONG WE Tv \"When I tell you this is the greatest transformation of all time, get ready,\" trainer Crooks (pictured) told PEOPLE of the reality star\u2019s slim down, which WEtv is calling \"the most shocking transformation in reality TV history.\" Though final results won't be seen until the From Not to Hot finale, Crooks promised \"you won't even be able to recognize her.\" Part of the process included \"changing how she looked at food,\" the trainer said. \"We had to cut down the portions.\" Now, \"she's doing awesome. She's killing it, but we're looking at making it even more so.\"\n\n05 of 20 FEELING IT \"I\u2019ve never felt this good before,\" Mama June admitted on a recent episode of From Not to Hot. \"Eating healthy gives me a lot more energy, which makes me work out harder and makes me lose the weight faster.\"\n\n06 of 20 A MAJOR MILESTONE WE tv While shopping for a flower girl dress for Honey Boo Boo to wear to Sugar Bear's wedding, Mama June was convinced to slip into a gown herself \u2014 and was amazed at what she saw in the mirror. \"I may not wanna be getting married, but damn, I look mighty hot in a wedding dress,\" she said.\n\n07 of 20 SEEING THE FINISH LINE WeTv \"I'm definitely not going to have any more [surgeries],\" Mama June shared on the Dominic Nati Show, adding that the WEtv didn't foot the bill for her transformation. \"I had to pay, just like everybody else,\" she said. But the surgeries were \"going to happen whether I had [bills] or not.\"\n\n08 of 20 A BIG LOSS WE TV \"When I started losing the weight, I weighed over 450 lbs.,\" Mama June said on a recent episode of From Not to Hot. \"I had the gastric sleeve [surgery] and lost 160 lbs.\" Her current weight?

Who would want that?\"\n\n13 of 20 NEW YORK, NEW LOOK SplashNews Arriving in N.Y.C. on April 4, 2017, with Honey Boo Boo, Shannon showed off her curves in a flattering empire top and black leggings \u2014 accessorized with a big smile.\n\n14 of 20 MAMA WHO? Rob Kim/Getty \"It's kind of like I'm in my own disguise,\" she told PEOPLE Now. \"A lot of people don't recognize who I am until I talk.

My legs are still a little bit fat and I have a jiggle-o and some cottage cheese, but I feel like I got what I wanted,\u201d she continued, adding that \u201cwhen I look in the mirror, I\u2019m happy.\u201d Mama June: From Hot to Not returns to WEtv on Friday, Jan. 12.", "images":
