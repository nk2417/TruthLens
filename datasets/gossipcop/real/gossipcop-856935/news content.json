That something is my weight,\u201d she wrote on May 25.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI normally don\u2019t comment on things like this because it draws attention to those trying to spread negativity but I\u2019m here to explain a few things and spread love.\u201d\n\nSarah, 26 \u2013 who has previously struggled with kidney dysplasia and needed a kidney transplant in 2012 \u2013 explained that she has been dealing with health issues, and that any weightloss can be put down to them.\n\nLoading the player...\n\nAnd while she didn\u2019t go into specifics, she did say that this past year hasn\u2019t been \u201cthe greatest for her\u201d and that it brought a lot of changes \u2013 physically and mentally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI am not a fan of \u2018being skinny,\u2019 \u201d she continued.\n\n\u201c\u2018Eat a burger,\u2019 \u2018Your head is bigger than your body and that\u2019s disgusting\u2019\u2026 And you\u2019re right! No-one\u2019s head should be bigger than their body but considering I\u2019ve basically been on bed rest for the past few months, I\u2019ve lost a lot of muscle mass.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy circumstances have put me in a place where I\u2019m not in control of what my body looks like.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BN6IDpODKDu/?taken-by=therealsarahhyland&hl=en\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSarah is trying to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle and eat protein to keep up her muscle mass while she isn\u2019t working out. She also admitted that she isn\u2019t letting the haters keep her down.\n\n\u201cMy self-confidence is not rendered from your comments. Because I will always be too fat. I will always be too skinny. I will never have enough curves to be called a woman. And I will always be a slut for wearing a push-up bra,\u201d she concluded. \u201cLove the you you set out to be. Be the best version of yourself. Be healthy.\u201d\n\nYou tell \u2019em, Sarah!\n\nRelated\n\nAdvertisement", "images": ["https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/11/andrew-and-fergie-feature-image-691e6fd02f613.jpg?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/WomansDay/2015/03/28/11810/465644316.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/11/Logo-1.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/11/t5_adobe_express.svg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e?d=mm&s=128", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/Now/2017/05/25/37741/hero.jpg?fit=900%2C750", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/WomansDay/2014/10/07/39530/sarah_hyland_matt_prokop.jpg?resize=380%2C285", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/11/the-family-stone-sequel-691e9a875ea9c.png?resize=720%2C405", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2017/05/25/1495672358174_facey.jpg?resize=479%2C257", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/PTL-logo-3.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/Vector.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/are-logo.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/tvweek_adobe_express-01.svg", "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/wp-content/themes/express/assets/images/icon-phosphor-circle.svg", "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2025/11/bear-and-sunny-feature-image-691e8fe58c85f.jpg?resize=720%2C405"], "top_img": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2017/05/25/1495672358174_facey.jpg?resize=479%2C257", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zoe Burrell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/health/sarah-hyland-anorexia-allegations-37741/", "title": "Modern Family\u2019s Sarah Hyland shuts down anorexia claims like a BOSS", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "taboola-author": "Zoe Burrell", "taboola-category": "Health", "taboola-section": "health", "taboola-pub-date": "2017-05-25T00:20:24+10:00", "taboola-updated-date": "2024-02-05T03:20:03+11:00", "taboola-title": "Modern Family\u2019s Sarah Hyland shuts down anorexia claims like a BOSS", "taboola-description": "<p>I am not a fan of \u2018being skinny'.</p>", "taboola-image-url": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/Now/2017/05/25/37741/hero.jpg?fit=479%2C399", "taboola-tags": "Modern Family, Sarah Hyland", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Modern Family star Sarah Hyland opens up about her weight and health issues.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Modern Family's Sarah Hyland shuts down anorexia claims like a BOSS", "description": "\"I am not a fan of \u2018being skinny'.\"", "url": "https://www.nowtolove.com.au/health/sarah-hyland-anorexia-allegations-37741/", "site_name": "Now To Love", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/now/2017/05/25/1495672358174_facey.jpg?resize=479%2C257", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nowtolove/", "published_time": "2017-05-25T00:20:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2024-02-05T03:20:03+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Modern Family's Sarah Hyland shuts down anorexia claims like a BOSS", "label1": "Est. reading time", "data1": "2 minutes", "label2": "Written by", "data2": "Zoe Burrell"}, "generator": "speculation-rules 1.6.0", "sailthru.date": "2017-05-25 00:20:24", "sailthru.title": "Modern Family\u2019s Sarah Hyland shuts down anorexia claims like a BOSS", "sailthru.tags": ",NW", "sailthru.author": "Zoe Burrell", "sailthru.description": "<p>I am not a fan of \u2018being skinny'.</p>", "sailthru.image.full": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/Now/2017/05/25/37741/hero.jpg?fit=479%2C399", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/Now/2017/05/25/37741/hero.jpg?fit=50%2C42", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://api.photon.aremedia.net.au/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2024/02/cropped-FavIcon.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495671624.0, "source": "https://www.nowtolove.com.au", "summary": ""}
