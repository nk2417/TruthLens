The drama series was salvaged for a sixth season with the focus shifting firmly to Wright\u2019s Claire Underwood character, who had become a bigger component of the storytelling during the past few years. Wright has been credited with galvanizing the effort to save the show from cancellation after actor Anthony Rapp came forward last November with the allegation that he was assaulted by Spacey when Rapp was 14.\n\nDuring the interview, Wright spoke about returning to the political tale \u2014 and about the embattled star she shared a screen with for nearly five years.\n\n\u201cI think we were all surprised, of course, and ultimately saddened,\u201d Wright told \u201cToday\u201d anchor Savannah Guthrie.\n\nWright emphasized that she did not socialize with Spacey, despite their working relationship as spouses on the Washington, D.C.-set drama. She has not spoken to him since the scandal broke.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/robin-wright.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/robin-wright.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Variety Staff", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/robin-wright-kevin-space-house-of-cards-sexual-harassment-1202868352/", "title": "Robin Wright on Kevin Spacey: \u2018House of Cards\u2019 Team \u2018Ultimately Saddened\u2019 by Harassment Allegations", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Robin Wright spoke out for the first time about allegations of harassment and assault leveled against her former co-star, Kevin Spacey.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Variety Staff", "tags": "Kevin Spacey, Robin Wright", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Robin Wright on Kevin Spacey: \u2018House of Cards\u2019 Team \u2018Ultimately Saddened\u2019 by Harassment Allegations", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/robin-wright-kevin-space-house-of-cards-sexual-harassment-1202868352/", "description": "Robin Wright spoke out for the first time about allegations of harassment and assault leveled against her former co-star, Kevin Spacey.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/robin-wright.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Robin Wright Addresses Kevin Spacey's Sexual Harassment Allegations"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-09T13:27:29+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-09T17:13:23+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Robin Wright spoke out for the first time about allegations of harassment and assault leveled against her former co-star, Kevin Spacey.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@Variety", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Robin Wright on Kevin Spacey: \u2018House of Cards\u2019 Team \u2018Ultimately Saddened\u2019 by Harassment Allegations", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/robin-wright.png?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531142849.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
