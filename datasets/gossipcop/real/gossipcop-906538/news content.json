And so for that I\u2019m really sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of those women are my dear friends and I love them and respect them and support what they\u2019re doing and want to be a part of that change \u2026 But I should get in the back seat and close my mouth for a while.\u201d Matt Damon on the #TimesUp movement. pic.twitter.com/jNjiIjuhVl \u2014 TODAY with Hoda & Jenna (@HodaAndJenna) January 16, 2018\n\nOf the #TimesUp movement, Damon said, \u201cA lot of those women are my dear friends and I love them and respect them and support what they\u2019re doing and want to be a part of that change and want to go along for that ride. But I should get in the back seat and close my mouth for a while.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nDuring his controversial interview with Peter Travors last month, Damon said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to figure \u2014 you know, there\u2019s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated, without question, but they shouldn\u2019t be conflated, right?\u201d he added.\n\nHis comments earned him backlash on social media, including from his \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d co-star Minnie Driver. \u201cGod God, SERIOUSLY?\u201d Driver tweeted in response. When a user tried to defend Damon, Driver replied, \u201cNo. You don\u2019t get to be hierarchical with abuse. And you don\u2019t get to tell women that because some guy only showed them their penis their pain isn\u2019t as great as a woman who was raped.\u201d\n\nGod God, SERIOUSLY? https://t.co/NDZFrLDXil \u2014 Minnie Driver TICKLESS WONDER (@driverminnie) December 15, 2017\n\nNo. You don\u2019t get to be hierarchical with abuse.
