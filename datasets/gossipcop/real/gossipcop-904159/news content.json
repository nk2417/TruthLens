In the most recent season, Peters played a cult leader who pursues political power following Donald Trump\u2019s presidential win, while Paulson played a woman traumatized by the victory.\n\nMurphy, the cast, and crew typically wait closer until the premiere date to announce the theme for each season, leaving fans of the scary anthology to speculate and search for small clues. Social media users are currently convinced that season 8 will be titled \u201cRadioactive.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWhen EW asked Murphy about the buzz, he responded, \u201cI heard about that rumor. Well, that\u2019s based on a fact that we\u2019ve cleared a lot of titles for that show.\u201d He continued, \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting idea. I can neither confirm nor deny.\u201d", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kathy-bates-walk-of-fame-honor.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kathy-bates-walk-of-fame-honor.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ariana Brockington", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/kathy-bates-sarah-paulson-evan-peters-returning-american-horror-story-season-8-1202731721/", "title": "Kathy Bates to Return for \u2018American Horror Story\u2019 Season 8", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d co-creator Ryan Murphy announced that Kathy Bates, Sarah Paulson, and Evan Peters will return for season 8.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Ariana Brockington", "tags": "American Horror Story, Kathy Bates", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kathy Bates to Return for \u2018American Horror Story\u2019 Season 8", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/kathy-bates-sarah-paulson-evan-peters-returning-american-horror-story-season-8-1202731721/", "description": "\u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d co-creator Ryan Murphy announced that Kathy Bates, Sarah Paulson, and Evan Peters will return for season 8.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kathy-bates-walk-of-fame-honor.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 562, "alt": "Kathy Bates Walk of Fame Honor"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-20T20:41:40+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-20T20:41:40+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d co-creator Ryan Murphy announced that Kathy Bates, Sarah Paulson, and Evan Peters will return for season 8.", "site": "@variety", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kathy Bates to Return for \u2018American Horror Story\u2019 Season 8", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/kathy-bates-walk-of-fame-honor.jpg?w=1000&h=562&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521578500.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
