{"url": "https://people.com/tv/jordan-rodgers-jojo-fletcher-wedding-planning-update/", "text": "Jordan Rodgers and JoJo Fletcher are enjoying the peace and quiet of life after The Bachelorette.\n\nThe couple, who got engaged on the season 12 finale in 2016, are happily living together in her hometown of Dallas, Texas \u2014 and though their fans are eagerly awaiting their nuptials, they\u2019re not in any rush to tie the knot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that we continually talk about,\u201d Rodgers, 29, tells PEOPLE. \u201cBut I think what\u2019s best right now is we feel no pressure to do it. Think about it: When you get together in an accelerated process, it makes sense to take your time afterwards. We still have no doubts about what we want to do, and we want to get married \u2014 but we want to enjoy every moment of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you meet in nine weeks, you miss the dating and the courtship and the traveling!\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd with what we both do for work \u2014 she\u2019s grinding, flipping houses, and from August to December I\u2019m traveling a ton \u2014 we\u2019re taking our time. But we\u2019re enjoying every moment of it. I imagine at some point in the near future we\u2019re going to sit down and really talk about when and what that\u2019ll look like, but we don\u2019t have a date set yet.\u201d\n\nBut even though they haven\u2019t nailed down any details, the SEC analyst says he and Fletcher, 27, are constantly gathering ideas.\n\n\u201cWe have really similar style, so we\u2019ll see pictures and both be like, \u2018Oh, I love that. I want to do something like that,\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cSo she\u2019s going to take the lead [with planning], but her style is so great. There\u2019s nothing that she picks or does that I don\u2019t like. And we see things all the time that give us ideas. We love the outdoors \u2014 something with a little rustic feel, lights in the trees.\u201d\n\nAbel Villalobos\n\nAs for televising the big day, Rodgers says it would \u201ctake a lot\u201d for him to agree to that\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just something about that day that is so special,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not saying no \u2014 like anything, it\u2019d have to be right. But there\u2019s just something about that day. I\u2019ve always thought the more private it can be, the more special, the more natural, the better. I wouldn\u2019t want my bride to be worried about anything other than us that day. I\u2019ll tell you what, though \u2014 the wedding dancing would be great. Because I\u2019ve got some friends that can break it down, so it would make great TV, for sure.\u201d\n\nAnd while the couple have yet to walk down the aisle, Rodgers says Fletcher is already experiencing some baby fever.\n\n\u201cBoth of JoJo\u2019s brothers are expecting,\u201d he reveals. \u201cSo the baby fever came, and she gives me those eyes. She\u2019s like, \u2018I want one!\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018We\u2019ve got things to do before we get there!\u2019 But also, I feel like she\u2019s going to get her fix. She\u2019ll get to feel what it\u2019s like to be an aunt, and she\u2019ll love that. But you better believe my parents are like, \u2018Hey, we want grandkids!\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cI always thought I\u2019d have a family similar to mine,\u201d he adds. \u201cSo there\u2019s three boys, and my mom is like:,\u2019You can have as many kids as you want, but you\u2019ve got to have three boys first so you know what you put me through!\u2019 I think JoJo and I always say we would like to have three kids, but you never know.\u201d\n\nAnd Rodgers \u2014 who, just in time for Valentine\u2019s Day, partnered with Captain Morgan to model their hilarious new Captain\u2019s Posepants boxer briefs \u2014 is happy to confirm that the spark is still very much alive with his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nCourtesy Captain Morgan\n\n\u201cWe always get lumped into being part of The Bachelor franchise, so every person is like, \u2018Oh my God, I\u2019m glad you guys are still together!\u2019 \u201d he says. \u201cAnd I just think you can\u2019t lump everybody into the same group, because every relationship is different.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get out of it what you put in, and I frustrated the hell out of her, because early on I knew I had feelings for her,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut I was like, \u2018Wait a minute. I\u2019m not going to tell you that, because we\u2019re on a boat in Uruguay. I\u2019m going to make sure I sleep on it, and make sure that these feelings are real and I\u2019m not getting caught up in the moment.\u2019 I think we did it the right way, and I think we were honest with each other.\u201d\n\n", "images":
