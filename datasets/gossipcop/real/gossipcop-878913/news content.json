News she would talk about her much-talked-about \u201cthird child\u201d when she was ready.\n\nKim explained: \u201c[There\u2019s] so many details out there, and like I\u2019ve never heard this, I\u2019ve never heard this.\n\n\u201cLike whatever. We have not confirmed it, and that\u2019s that. I\u2019ll let you know when we\u2019re ready.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve definitely seen a lot of things, we\u2019ve never confirmed anything.\u201d\n\nKim made the comments during a night out with her sister Kendall Jenner at the Harper\u2019s BAZAAR event celebrating ICONS By Carine Roitfeld in New York.\n\nRumours surrounding Kim and Kanye deciding to expand their family have been circulating for months, after the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star said she would use a surrogate.\n\nEarlier this week it was revealed that the couple, who are already parents to North, four, and Saint, one, will be welcoming a baby girl in January.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the pair decided to have a third baby via surrogacy because of Kim\u2018s well-documented medical issues during her previous pregnancies.\n\nAnother source told People: \u201cThe entire family is over the moon.\n\n\u201cGiven her health scares in the past, Kim felt the need to hire a surrogacy agency that helped serve as the liaison in finding a healthy woman who would be a great surrogate option for her and Kanye.\n\n\u201cBoth of them have been super involved in the process.\u201d\n\nNeither Kim nor Kanye has confirmed the news but it\u2019s not the first time they\u2019ve been at the centre of speculation a third child is on the way.\n\nReports of a surrogate surfaced in July, with Us Weekly claiming their chosen surrogate was already three months pregnant.\n\nAn insider alleged at the time that the woman was approached by the famous couple through \u201can agency\u201d.\n\nClaims of a surrogate child being on the way come after Kim revealed she suffers from a condition that means she is unable to carry any more children.\n\nIn an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians aired last year, the reality star was warned she could \u201cbleed to death\u201d if she falls pregnant for a third time.\n\nKim sought her doctor\u2019s advice after admitting she wanted a third pregnant but fearing the same complications she endured in past pregnancies would return.\n\nDoctor Crane warned her against it and said there is a \u201cpotential fear\u201d for her after she suffered from toxaemia \u2013 toxins in the blood from infection \u2013 and had two \u201cvery traumatic\u201d labours with North and Saint.\n\nHe said: \u201cHere\u2019s what I think, your pregnancies, you had toxaemia, you had a retained placenta, very traumatic, we\u2019re always worried about the next serious complication. I think the potential fear of the whole situation is legitimate.\n\n\u201cYou never know that you might not have the same type of problem that might be more serious this time. You\u2019re always taking a little bit of a chance. There are situations where retained placenta could be life and death.\u201d\n\nHer mother Kris, 61, then said: \u201cYou could bleed to death\u201d.\n\nWhat is toxaemia of pregnancy? During Kim\u2019s last two pregnancy she suffered from toxaemia \u2013 more commonly known as pre-eclampsia. It is a condition that can affect pregnant women, resulting in high blood pressure and damage to one or more organs, often the kidneys. It is usually diagnosed after 20 weeks of pregnancy and can lead to serious complications for mother and baby. In Kim\u2019s case she was warned that she could \u2018bleed to death\u2019 if she got pregnant again following complications the last two times.\n\nKim confirmed last month that she and Kanye were hopeful of a third child, but kept tight lipped about details or timing.\n\nSpeaking to The Hollywood Reporter about the possibility of a third child, she said: \u201cI hope so. There have been a lot of things said and Kanye and I have not confirmed anything. We\u2019re definitely trying. We are hoping so.\u201d\n\nKim has spoken in the past about exploring surrogacy \u2013 and even said she\u2019d asked sisters Kourtney and Khloe if they would be willing to carry her child.\n\nSpeaking during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live, she explained: \u201cI have had to go through multiple things to try and do it on my own but I do not think that is looking good for me but I am not giving up.\n\n\u201cSo it is a process. You kind of see the whole thing on this next season of our show\u2026 of me begging Khloe to help out, but I do not want to do that to her.\n\n\u201cMy mom offered, Kourtney offered.\u201d\n\nKim\u2019s troubles began when she was pregnant with her first child North after doctors discovered she had a high-risk condition called placenta accreta.\n\nThe rare condition occurs when the placenta attaches too deep into the uterine wall and is life-threatening because the sufferer can lose an average of three to five litres of blood during delivery.\n\nGot a story? email digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk or call us direct on 02077824220", "images": ["https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000350774480.jpg?strip=all&w=790", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000286695433.jpg?strip=all&w=831", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000336053865.jpg?strip=all&w=329", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000321840121.jpg?strip=all&w=657", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000195882454.jpg?strip=all&w=649", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000351433377.jpg?strip=all&w=806", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000303189991.jpg?strip=all&w=731", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000327865971.jpg?strip=all&w=715", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000319246894.jpg?strip=all&w=716", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pmcompositekim.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000198078231.jpg?strip=all&w=658", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000198444365.jpg?strip=all&w=640", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000350821755.jpg?strip=all&w=795", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000347905549.jpg?strip=all&w=640", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000347905548.jpg?strip=all&w=640", "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nintchdbpict000299267530.jpg?strip=all&w=680"], "top_img": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pmcompositekim.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=750&h=500&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/4426397/kim-kardashian-breaks-silence-on-surrogacy-reports/", "title": "Kim Kardashian breaks her silence over surrogacy amid claims she\u2019s chosen \u2018married college graduate\u2019 to carry her third child", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2025 NYP Holdings.
