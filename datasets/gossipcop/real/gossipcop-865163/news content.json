I adore it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI had to trust that it was the right thing and Tony had asked me and maybe if he\u2019d asked me, it was the right thing,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was as about doing honor, doing justice and knowing my herstory.\u201d\n\nTo prepare, Garfield spent time consulting his LGBTQ friends. \u201c[The play is] as much devoted to my friends in the gay community as it is those that passed during the epidemic,\u201d he said.\n\nHe also turned to an iconic drag queen: RuPaul. Garfield and friends made their way through every season of the Supermodel of the World\u2019s hit series RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. \u201cMy only time off during rehearsals \u2013 every Sunday \u2014 I would have eight friends over and we would just watch Ru,\u201d Garfield said.\n\n\u201cThis is my life outside of this play,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am a gay man right now just without the physical act \u2013 that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Andy Cohen\u2019s Top 5 Most Revealing Plead the Fifth Answers\n\nGarfield may have immersed himself in gay culture, but confusing that with the extent of gay life upset many members of the LGBTQ community \u2014 some of whom quickly expressed their frustration on Twitter, accusing Garfield of cultural appropriation.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a talented guy, but you seem to be completely oblivious to what is coming out of your mouth,\u201d out actor Scott Evans (Daytime Divas) wrote.\n\n\u201cThe straight white privilege of Andrew Garfield,\u201d said out comedian H. Alan Scott. \u201cMust be nice to be able to be gay without any of the hardships.\u201d\n\nOther users criticized Garfield for seemingly failing to understand that appreciating gay culture is not the same as experiencing the oppression facing the LGBTQ community now and throughout history.\n\n\u201cGarfield compared watching a TV show and portraying a gay man to being gay without the physical act. No buddy,\u201d said one user \u2014 with another adding Garfield had \u201ca very limited view of what being gay ACTUALLY is.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlaying a gay man\u2026doesn\u2019t suddenly mean he understands oppression,\u201d a critic wrote. \u201cWhy\u2026is he preparing for a play about the TRAGEDY OF THE AIDS CRISIS by watching Drag Race? That\u2019s obtuse at best.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Garfield has found himself facing backlash from the gay community. During the Golden Globes in January, Garfield famously locked lips with Ryan Reynolds \u2014 causing many to criticize him for making a joke of a kiss between two men.", "images":
