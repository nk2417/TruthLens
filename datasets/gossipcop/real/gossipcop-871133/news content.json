However, the prolific producer insists the latest extension of the popular franchise, Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders, will instantly set itself apart from the many iterations that came before it.\n\n\u201cThis is a show that has an agenda,\u201d Wolf told reporters Thursday at the Television Critics Association summer press tour. \u201cYour mind is going to receive information that I think will change a lot of people\u2019s attitudes.\u201d\n\nThe eight-episode first installment of the anthology is described as a \u201cgripping, in-depth dramatization\u201d of the famed murder case that took America by storm in the early 1990s. When brothers Lyle and Erik Menendez were tried on national TV for brutally killing their parents in Beverly Hills on Aug. 20, 1989, their story became a nationwide obsession. Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders dives into the players, the crime and the media circus, detailing the day-to-day battles of the trial and unveiling the shocking truth of what really went down behind the scenes.\n\nWhile Wolf had previously used the famed Menendez case as inspiration for self-contained episodes of Law & Order, Wolf admitted he was initially hesitant about whether there was enough material to make a \u201ccompelling\u201d series. However, Law & Order vet Rene Balcer serves as showrunner and did extensive research that eased Wolf\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cThe research revealed things none of us knew, and that\u2019s one of the things that I think is most impactful about the eight hours,\u201d Wolf said.\n\nIn addition to focusing on the molestation both boys alleged they suffered at the hands of their mother and father \u2014 one incident Balcer said occurred two weeks before the murders \u2014 the first season of the anthology will also examine the politics that played a role in the case and their sentencing. \u201cThe other part of the story that is probably not well known is the degree of political collusion between the judge and the district attorney\u2019s office in the second trial to ensure a conviction,\u201d Balcer said. \u201cThat\u2019s one new facet to the case that the series sort of highlights.\u201d\n\nWolf is confident these new details, joined by a cast led by four-time Emmy winner Edie Falco as the Menendez brothers\u2019 defense attorney, will keep viewers coming back despite viewers already knowing the outcome.\n\n\u201cI think anybody who watches the first episode is going to be there every week because there is new information,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cWhen you see the information, I think people are going to realize, \u2018Yeah, they did it,\u2019 but it wasn\u2019t first-degree murder without possibility of parole.\u201d Wolf said he believed that the brothers should instead have been convicted of first-degree manslaughter.\n\nAdded Wolf: \u201cAfter 27 years of Law & Orders, this is taken from the headlines. We\u2019ve made some great shows ripped from the headlines. This is on a different level.\u201d\n\nAfter the panel in a scrum with reporters, Wolf said that \u201cthere are discussions\u201d about future iterations. \u201cLook, this is endless if you get the right case,\u201d he said. \u201cYou just think of [Timothy] McVeigh in Oklahoma City, Richard Ramirez, Son of Sam \u2014 there are a lot of things that I would like to examine for a full eight hours.\u201d\n\nLaw & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders premieres Sept. 26 on NBC.\n\nWatch the latest trailer for the series.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/LAWORDERTRUECRIMETHEMENENDEZMURDERS_Still2.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/LAWORDERTRUECRIMETHEMENENDEZMURDERS_Still2.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Stanhope", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/dick-wolf-discusses-agenda-behind-law-order-true-crime-menendez-murders-1026527/", "title": "Dick Wolf Discusses \u201cAgenda\u201d Behind \u2018Law and Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Fellow EP Rene Balcer also discussed the new information that will be highlighted in the eight-episode drama.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Kate Stanhope", "tags": "Dick Wolf, Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders, TCA 2017, The Menendez Murders", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Dick Wolf Discusses \u201cAgenda\u201d Behind \u2018Law and Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders\u2019", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/dick-wolf-discusses-agenda-behind-law-order-true-crime-menendez-murders-1026527/", "description": "Fellow EP Rene Balcer also discussed the new information that will be highlighted in the eight-episode drama.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/LAWORDERTRUECRIMETHEMENENDEZMURDERS_Still2.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 577, "alt": "Dick Wolf Discusses \"Agenda\" Behind 'Law and Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders'"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-03T10:51:17+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-12T09:44:41+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Fellow EP Rene Balcer also discussed the new information that will be highlighted in the eight-episode drama.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Dick Wolf Discusses \u201cAgenda\u201d Behind \u2018Law and Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders\u2019", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/LAWORDERTRUECRIMETHEMENENDEZMURDERS_Still2.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/xh01uHWc15Q"], "publish_date": 1501757477.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
