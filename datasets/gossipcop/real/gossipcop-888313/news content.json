And, Swift's fans claim she told them it's about her boyfriend Joe Alwyn during her Reputation Secret Sessions with them.\n\nThe lyrics describe how they met and she fell for him...when she was still dating someone else (Tom Hiddleston, perhaps?)\n\nBut the words, always open to interpretation, really speak for themselves. Here they are:\n\nIntro\n\nGorgeous\n\nVerse 1:\n\nYou should take it as a compliment\n\nThat I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk\n\nYou should think about the consequence\n\nOf your magnetic field being a little too strong\n\nAnd I got a boyfriend, he's older than us\n\nSwift's last boyfriend before 26-year-old actor Joe Alwyn was 36-year-old actor Tom Hiddleston. Swift and Hiddleston officially broke up in September 2016 (though a reconciliation rumor went around at the end of October last year.) While it's unclear when Swift and Alwyn officially first met and started dating, they were filmed leaving a private Kings of Leon concert together in October 2016. Swift went to the screening of Alwyn's film Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk in November.\n\nHe's in the club doin' I don't know what\n\nYou're so cool it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)\n\nPre-Chorus:\n\nWhiskey on ice, sunset and vine\n\nYou've ruined my life by not being mine\n\nChorus:\n\nYou're so gorgeous\n\nI can't say anything to your face\n\n'Cause look at your face\n\nAnd I'm so furious\n\nAt you for making me feel this way\n\nBut what can I say?\n\nYou're gorgeous\n\nVerse 2:\n\nYou should take it as a compliment\n\nThat I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)\n\nAnd you should think about the consequence\n\nOf you touching my hand in the darkened room (dark room, dark room)\n\nIf you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her\n\nBut if you're single that's honestly worse\n\n'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts\n\n(Honey, it hurts)\n\nPre-Chorus:\n\nOcean blue eyes looking in mine\n\nI feel like I might sink and drown and die\n\nChorus:\n\nYou're so gorgeous\n\nI can't say anything to your face (to your face)\n\n'Cause look at your face (look at your face)\n\nAnd I'm so furious\n\nAt you for making me feel this way (this way)\n\nBut what can I say?\n\nYou're gorgeous\n\nBridge:\n\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah\n\nThere's nothing I hate more than what I can't have\n\nYou are so gorgeous it makes me so mad\n\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah\n\nThere's nothing I hate more than what I can't have\n\nGuess I'll just stumble on home to my cats\n\nSwift, of course, has two famous cats: Olivia Benson and Meredith Grey. (Previous boyfriends have cat sat them.)\n\nAlone, unless you wanna come along, oh!\n\nChorus:\n\nYou're so gorgeous\n\nI can't say anything to your face (to your face)\n\n'Cause look at your face (look at your face)\n\nAnd I'm so furious\n\nAt you for making me feel this way (feel this way)\n\nBut what can I say?\n\nYou're gorgeous\n\nOutro:\n\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah\n\nThere's nothing I hate more than what I can't have\n\nYou are so gorgeous it makes me so mad\n\nYou're gorgeous\n\nYou make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah\n\nThere's nothing I hate more than what I can't have\n\nYou are so gorgeous it makes me so mad\n\nYou're gorgeous\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images":
