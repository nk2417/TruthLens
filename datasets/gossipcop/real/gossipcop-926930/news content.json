It's thanks to his profession that he first crossed paths with Paltrow some years ago, while the Goop founder was still acting.\n\n\"We feel incredibly lucky to have come together at this juncture in our lives when our collective successes and failures can serve as building blocks for a healthy and happy relationship,\" the pair said in their engagement announcement in January 2018.\n\nAhead, see everything to know about Paltrow's husband, from his award-winning TV shows to how he and Paltrow first met (plus, his endearing bond with her ex-husband).\n\nHe works in television.\n\nFalchuk got his big break as a producer working as a writer on Season 1 of Nip/Tuck with Ryan Murphy, according to People. Falchuk and Murphy have since become regular collaborators, namely as co-creators on Glee, American Horror Story, American Crime Story, and Pose.\n\nJason LaVeris // Getty Images\n\nHe is an Emmy winner.\n\nThanks to his work as executive producer on American Crime Story, Falchuk is a two-time Emmy winner for Outstanding Limited Series (in 2016 and 2018). Falchuk also received 11 other nominations\u2014several of which come from Outstanding Writing\u2014for his additional TV projects, including Glee, American Horror Story: Freak Show, American Horror Story: Coven \"Bitchcraft,\" and Pose.\n\nHe met Paltrow on the set of Glee.\n\nFalchuk and Paltrow first met in 2010 when she appeared as a guest star on Glee, playing substitute teacher Holly Holliday. Paltrow went on to reprise the role several times in the following years, and the pair eventually hit it off. They are said to have officially begun dating in 2014, per Hello! magazine.\n\nHe is friends with Paltrow's ex-husband, Chris Martin.\n\nGiven his success within the entertainment industry, Falchuk is unsurprisingly well connected with his share of celebrity artists. But thanks to Paltrow in particular, he has fostered a special friendship with Coldplay front man Chris Martin, who was previously married to Paltrow and welcomed two kids with her, Apple and Moses Martin.\n\nPaltrow and Martin first met backstage during a Coldplay concert back in 2002, and shared a romance until 2014, the same year that Paltrow also reportedly got together with Falchuk. The two have remained on good terms as co-parents following their split, so much so that Martin has become close with his ex's now husband.\n\nPaltrow even shared a photo of her husband and her ex-husband laughing together at brunch on Instagram in November 2017, writing in the caption, \"Sunday brunch #modernfamily.\"\n\nHe proudly posts about Paltrow on Instagram.\n\nThough Falchuk isn't super active online, he isn't shy about showing off Paltrow when he posts, and it's clear that they're very much in love.", "images":
