The mystery was solved earlier this week when the Sex And The City actress was photographed as she left for her appearance on The Tonight Show in New York, showing off her new soft sweeping fringe and an updated golden blonde colour. The restyle comes courtesy of Sarah Jessica's longtime friend and hairdresser Serge Normant, who shared some details of the cut on his Instagram page.\n\n\u00a9 Photo: Getty Images\n\nSarah Jessica Parker debuted her new hairstyle this week\n\nCrediting his colleague Gina Gilbert for the actress' new blonde tones, the celebrity stylist wrote, \"@sarahjessicaparker tonight on her way to @fallontonight with a new haircut! swept bangs! Color @ginagilbertnyc #sergenormant using my dream big collection.\" Referring to his own product line, it looks like it was a range of volumising products that achieved Sarah Jessica's trademark tousled waves, which were styled to tumble effortlessly past her shoulders.\n\nREAD MORE: Sarah Jessica Parker responds to Kim Cattrall's 'upsetting' Sex and the City comments\n\nStylist Serge Normant used his Dream Big product collection to create the look\n\nEarlier on in the week, the 52-year-old posted a cryptic message on her Instagram page alongside a snap of her recently-chopped locks, simply writing, \"Not saying anything.
