I\u2019ve had people who want to watch it with me, which is both flattering and creepy.\n\nDon\u2019t ask to watch Home Alone with Macaulay, it\u2019s too \u2018creepy\u2019 (Picture: Michael Rozman/Warner Bros.)\n\n\u2018When I\u2019m watching it I\u2019m remembering that day on the set, like how I was hiding my Pepsi behind the couch,\u2019 he explained, \u2018I can\u2019t watch it the same way other people do.\u2019\n\nThe former child star first rose to fame after his award-winning performance in Home Alone back in 1990.\n\nThe now 37-year-old actor then went on to star in the film\u2019s sequel \u2013 Home Alone 2: Lost in New York \u2013 which has become such a festive TV favourite that Macaulay can\u2019t bear to go outside because of it.\n\nIt\u2019s Macaulay season! (Picture: Twentieth Century Fox)\n\nHe continued: \u2018I definitely don\u2019t [go out of the house at Christmas and Thanksgiving.] It\u2019s my season. It\u2019s Macaulay season. I try to go out less and less around that time of year.\u2019\n\nDespite looking as youthful as his on-screen character Kevin McCallister, the Hollywood entertainer strictly refuses to pull the classic shocked face with his hands on his cheeks, reminiscent of his role in the comedy flick.\n\nThe child actor still gets asked to pull this face (Picture: Twentieth Century Fox)\n\nHe said: \u2018I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, been there done that already. I\u2019m 37 now, OK\u201d.\u2019\n\nThe appearance marked a rarity for the actor, as the star confessed he\u2019s somewhat of a \u2018ground hog\u2019 when it comes to show business.\n\nExplaining his hiatus from the movie business, he said: \u2018I was tired of it. I did like 14 movies in six years. It\u2019s a lot. I was away from home a lot, I was away from school. I needed to grow and develop as a person. I was actually looking forward to going to school. I lived the dream.\n\n\u2018It was great to be around people my own age for once. I\u2019m always treated differently. At the same time that\u2019s the kind of stuff you have to figure out.\n\n\u2018It was the smartest thing I possibly could\u2019ve done, taking eight years off.\u2019\n\nMacaulay Culkin\u2019s full interview on The Ellen Show is due to air on Monday 23 April.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
