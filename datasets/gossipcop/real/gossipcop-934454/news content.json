The two actors will depart at the end of the show\u2019s current and 14th season.\n\n\u201cThe characters of Arizona and April are permanently woven into the fabric of Grey\u2019s Anatomy thanks to the extraordinary work of Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew,\u201d said executive producer Krista Vernof. \u201cAs writers, our job is to follow the stories where they want to go and sometimes that means saying goodbye to characters we love. It has been a joy and a privilege to work with these phenomenally talented actresses.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always hard for me to say goodbye to any of my characters,\u201d said executive producer Shonda Rhimes. \u201cBoth Arizona Robbins and April Kepner are not only beloved but iconic \u2014 both the LBGTQ and devout Christian communities are underrepresented on TV. I will be forever grateful to both Jessica and Sarah for bringing these characters to life with such vibrant performance and for inspiring women around the globe. They will always be a part of our Shondaland family.\u201d\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nCapshaw and Drew\u2019s departures follow the signing of series star Ellen Pompeo to a lucrative deal that will keep her with the drama franchise and pay her as much as $20 million per season.
