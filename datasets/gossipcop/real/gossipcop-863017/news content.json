Tyler Henry leaves Vanderpump Rules star Stassi Schroeder stunned on Hollywood Medium and Us Weekly has the first exclusive look.\n\nAs Henry scribbles in his notepad \u2014 which helps him make sense of messages he receives from the spirits he is communicating with \u2014 he says, \u201cThis is a message I want to kind of deliver, and it\u2019s something they do frequently say, but it comes through extra in this case. She does not want her death to be how we remember her when it comes to like, her life.\u201d\n\nRelated: Stars Who Got Their Start on Reality TV The road to success in Hollywood is a little different for every would-be actor, but these days, reality TV is becoming a major launching pad for some of the industry's biggest stars. Before they were red-carpet regulars, NeNe Leakes, Jennifer Hudson, Julianne Hough and Lucy Hale were among those who broke through as reality stars\n\nThe 28-year-old blonde beauty, who is accompanied by co-star and best friend Kristen Doute, giggles nervously as Henry continues, \u201cAnd just recently there was a conversation that was had. People were basically like, \u2018Look, let\u2019s focus on her life.\u2019 And I need to emphasize this because she\u2019s coming through a lot. She\u2019s having to talk about her passing and the circumstances that she went. She doesn\u2019t feel like when she went, she had full closure with the people around her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like, \u2018I want there to be a release of any anger, any frustration, any resentment, any family tension, any family conflict.\u2019 She wasn\u2019t able to have closure or really convey her feelings to the full extent and the feeling is basically, \u2018I died without being able to have it resolved.\u2019 Does that make sense?\u201d Henry, 21, asks.\n\nRelated: Reality TV Tragedies: The Saddest and Most Shocking Deaths Among those who have passed away in recent years are stars from Deadliest Catch, The Real World, Survivor, The Real Housewives, Buckwild, and The Bachelorette\n\nSchroeder, shocked and teary-eyed, confirms to Henry that he was communicating with her maternal grandmother, who had a falling out with Schroeder\u2019s mother, and passed away under mysterious circumstances. The tragic situation \u201chaunted\u201d Schroeder\u2019s mother, as she was never able to make peace before Schroeder\u2019s grandmother\u2019s death.\n\nTo find out whether or not Schroeder finds closure by the end of her reading, watch Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry on E!
