You were so passionate back then? No you weren\u2019t. That\u2019s number one.

While the company noted that the photo wasn\u2019t taken during a Too Black Guys photoshoot, they defended both their clothing and Drake\u2019s intention, writing, \u201cWe feel that Drake, who is a long-time friend of the brand, was brilliantly illustrating the hypocrisy of the Jim Crow Era. The subtleties of Drake, a young black man, mimicking how white men used to mimic and dehumanize black people may be lost in a rap battle, but we should not be distracted from the issues that are still affecting our communities.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pusha-t-to-drake-beef-0b51ab31-9151-44b0-9ffa-77d544743158.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pusha-t-to-drake-beef-0b51ab31-9151-44b0-9ffa-77d544743158.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jon Blistein", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/pusha-t-to-drake-you-are-silent-on-all-black-issues-628100/", "title": "Pusha-T to Drake: \u2018You Are Silent on All Black Issues\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Pusha-T dismissed Drake's explanation of his blackface photo, saying, \"You are silent on all black issues, Drake.\"", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Jon Blistein", "tags": "Drake, Hip-Hop, Pusha T", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Pusha-T to Drake: 'You Are Silent on All Black Issues'", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/pusha-t-to-drake-you-are-silent-on-all-black-issues-628100/", "description": "Pusha-T dismissed Drake's explanation of his blackface photo, saying, \"You are silent on all black issues, Drake.\"", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pusha-t-to-drake-beef-0b51ab31-9151-44b0-9ffa-77d544743158.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1", "width": 1401, "height": 788, "alt": "Drake, Pusha T"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-31T17:40:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T13:38:31+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Pusha-T dismissed Drake's explanation of his blackface photo, saying, \"You are silent on all black issues, Drake.\"", "site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pusha-T to Drake: \u2018You Are Silent on All Black Issues\u2019", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pusha-t-to-drake-beef-0b51ab31-9151-44b0-9ffa-77d544743158.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527788439.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
