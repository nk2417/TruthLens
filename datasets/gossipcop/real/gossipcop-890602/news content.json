It\u2019s going to be cheap!\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re going to do with my character. My character is very, very broad and I don\u2019t know who they\u2019re going to find to play that.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Up Next Previous Page Next Page\n\nAnyone crossing their fingers for a surprise appearance from Midler or her co-stars Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker are going to be disappointed.\n\nMidler said it would be hard to recast her role (Picture: SNAP/REX/Shutterstock/Disney)\n\nDespite having previously expressed interest in reprising her role with Parker and Najimy, when asked if she would make a cameo appearance in the remake for the right amount of money, she said: \u2018No, no, no!\u2019\n\nIt is hard to imagine anyone else performing I Put A Spell On You quite as well as Midler.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaC-WDrvmUQ\n\nThe remake is still in development and is being written by Scarlett Lacey. Original producer David Kirschner is also on board, however original director Kenny Ortega is not involved.\n\nArrow MORE: 13 reasons Hocus Pocus is the best Halloween film ever\n\nArrow MORE: Queen
