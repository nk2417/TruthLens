Fans are certainly on board with the idea. \"If they\u2019re dating I would die of happiness,\" wrote one commenter. Another wrote, \"Omg please be dating Wells. One of the best bachelor guys!\"\n\nAs of now, neither has confirmed any kind of relationship.\n\nIn August, Hyland split from her boyfriend of two years, Shadowhunters star Dominic Sherwood. A source close to the couple told ET at the time that Hyland and Sherwood would remain friends, but noted that the relationship had simply run its course.\n\nAdams was rumored to be dating fellow Bachelor in Paradise star Danielle Maltby, but denied the claims to ET in September.\n\nFor more on his relationship status, watch the video below!", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-08/set_wells_adams_instagram_001.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/sarah_hyland_wells_adams_halloween_102817_intagram_0.jpg?h=4acce965", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-01/1280_sarah_hyland_dominic_sherwood_170108_631266066.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2024-04/mk-Gerry-Turner-and-Theresa-Nist-2-1920-x-800-GALLERY-HERO-TEAR.jpg?h=0a35da97&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/sarah_hyland_wells_adams_halloween_102817_intagram_0.jpg?h=4acce965", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/sarah-hyland-and-bachelorette-star-wells-adams-spark-dating-rumors-matching-halloween-costumes", "title": "Sarah Hyland and 'Bachelorette' Star Wells Adams Spark Dating Rumors With Matching Halloween Costumes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/sarah_hyland_wells_adams_halloween_102817_intagram_0.jpg?h=4acce965", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The pair celebrated Halloween together as characters from 'Stranger Things', causing a stir in the comments on Instagram.", "title": "Sarah Hyland and 'Bachelorette' Star Wells Adams Spark Dating Rumors With Matching Halloween Costumes", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/sarah-hyland-and-bachelorette-star-wells-adams-spark-dating-rumors-matching-halloween-costumes", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The pair celebrated Halloween together as characters from 'Stranger Things', causing a stir in the comments on Instagram.", "twitter": {"description": "The pair celebrated Halloween together as characters from 'Stranger Things', causing a stir in the comments on Instagram.", "title": "Sarah Hyland and 'Bachelorette' Star Wells Adams Spark Dating Rumors With Matching Halloween Costumes", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/sarah-hyland-and-bachelorette-star-wells-adams-spark-dating-rumors-matching-halloween-costumes", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-10/sarah_hyland_wells_adams_halloween_102817_intagram_0.jpg?h=4acce965", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Sarah Hyland and 'Bachelorette' Star Wells Adams Spark Dating Rumors With Matching Halloween Costumes | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Sarah Hyland", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
