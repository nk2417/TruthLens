Certain things you can\u2019t do. There are these different sets of considerations within the friendship. It\u2019s like having a friend with an autoimmune disease.\u201d\n\nMultiple outlets picked up on the admittedly insensitive comment and spun the quote slightly out of context, making it seem as though Lorde had specifically targeted Swift with her off-color remark.\n\nThe New Zealand native was hit with a number of comments from fans who felt she was making light of serious health challenges. One in particular seemed to resonate with Lorde, and the Melodrama creator took to Twitter to offer her apologies. \u201cI wonder how @selenagomez feels about this,\u201d the commenter tweeted. \u201cWhat an incredibly ignorant analogy to make.\u201d (Swift\u2019s other BFF, Selena Gomez, suffers from lupus, and has been very open about her struggles.)\n\ndidn\u2019t mention taylor, but regardless, i fucked up & that was really insensitive. i\u2019m sorry ? \u2014 Lorde (@lorde) June 20, 2017\n\nIn response, Lorde tweeted: \u201cDidn\u2019t mention Taylor, but regardless, I f\u2013ked up & that was really insensitive. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d The original commenter later thanked Lorde for admitting her misstep. \u201c<3 love you for owning this, queen of apologies! x\u201d she wrote.\n\nLorde has been a very visible part of Swift\u2019s notorious \u201csquad\u201d from the get-go, and the fellow musical prodigies have shared snippets of their friendship on social media. In November, Swift threw Lorde a star-studded 20th birthday party that included the likes of Karlie Kloss, Lena Dunham, Aziz Ansari and Jack Antonoff.", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lorde-aplogizes-for-comparing-taylor-swift-friendship-to-auto-immune-disease-df408131-d30f-4c14-8c9f-09e05a64bfe0.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lorde-aplogizes-for-comparing-taylor-swift-friendship-to-auto-immune-disease-df408131-d30f-4c14-8c9f-09e05a64bfe0.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/lorde-apologizes-for-comparing-taylor-swift-friendship-to-autoimmune-disease-202959/", "title": "Lorde: Sorry for Taylor Swift Friendship, Disease Comparison", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Lorde addresses out-of-context quote about Taylor Swift with one tweet", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Joyce Chen", "tags": "Lorde, Taylor Swift", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Lorde: Sorry for Comparing Taylor Swift Friendship to Autoimmune Disease", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/lorde-apologizes-for-comparing-taylor-swift-friendship-to-autoimmune-disease-202959/", "description": "Lorde addresses out-of-context quote about Taylor Swift with one tweet", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lorde-aplogizes-for-comparing-taylor-swift-friendship-to-auto-immune-disease-df408131-d30f-4c14-8c9f-09e05a64bfe0.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1", "width": 1600, "height": 900, "alt": "Lorde: Sorry for Taylor Swift Friendship, Disease Comparison"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-20T15:08:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T16:28:06+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Lorde addresses out-of-context quote about Taylor Swift with one tweet", "site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lorde Apologizes for Comparing Taylor Swift Friendship to Autoimmune Disease", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/lorde-aplogizes-for-comparing-taylor-swift-friendship-to-auto-immune-disease-df408131-d30f-4c14-8c9f-09e05a64bfe0.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/R-Avatar_512x512_flat.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497971280.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
