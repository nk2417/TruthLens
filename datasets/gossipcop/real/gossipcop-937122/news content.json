{"url": "https://www.brides.com/gallery/princess-diana-prince-charles-royal-wedding", "text": "Years after Princess Diana and King Charles (who was Prince Charles at the time) tied the knot on July 29, 1981, the late royal went on record and called her wedding \u201cthe worst day of my life\u201d (footage of this moment was included in the documentary Diana: In Her Own Words). Ahead of that statement, Diana explained that, \u201cI don\u2019t think I was happy,\u201d but also noted that she never tried to call off the duo\u2019s nuptials (however fraught their relationship, Diana did love her husband and regularly affirmed this). Though Diana\u2019s words and feelings can and should be taken at face value, there\u2019s further proof that her wedding day was a challenging experience: Body language expert Judi James recently weighed in and told The Sun that she noticed several \u201cred flags\u201d about their relationship in the photos.\n\n\u201cThis \u2018fairy-tale\u2019 event was later described by Diana as \u2018the worst day of my life\u2019 and there are clues to her powerful but conflicting emotions,\u201d James affirmed. \u201cEven if we take away the royal theme, Diana\u2019s wedding day had red flags flapping about like bunting in the breeze.\u201d The expert touched on Diana\u2019s big-day arrival at St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral, explaining that she looked shy and hesitant; James commented on Diana\u2019s \u201canxious\u201d body language (she was hunched over and her expression was tight), which apparently eased during the rest of the ceremony (she smiled comfortably under her veil at the altar, while Charles remained stone-faced).\n\nGetty Images / Princess Diana Archive / Stringer\n\nAfter the couple\u2019s ceremony ended though, things took a turn\u2014and reached a peak during the couple\u2019s post-nuptial carriage ride. According to the outlet, Charles turned his back on his bride to engage with the crowds, which is when Diana leaned forward and stretched her neck; her expression was troubled (and not at all reflective of what you\u2019d expect to see from a blushing bride). This pose suggests that she wanted her husband\u2019s attention and felt particularly vulnerable when she didn\u2019t get it, per James\u2019 analysis.\n\nGetty Images / Tim Graham / Contributor\n\nThe new bride was also particularly reserved on the famed royal balcony after the event, James noted. Per the expert, she gravitated towards the children (and even held their hands instead of Charles\u2019); she kept her head tucked down and shared a few shy smiles with the crowd. The kiss she gave Charles during this moment, however, tells a slightly different story: The way she threw her head back and arched into her new husband indicates a sense of surrender\u2014and a willingness to trust him implicitly, per the expert.\n\nAccording to James, Diana\u2019s body language throughout the entirety of her wedding day indicated that she felt alone, anxious, and unsure\u2014but that she very much wanted to feel otherwise. In fact, the late princess wanted the public (and her children) to know that she and Charles did love and cherish each for a period, despite their issues. \u201cShe really wanted people to know that she loved Charles and he loved her,\u201d royal biographer Ingrid Seward said, according to The Times. And I always remembered that. And she wanted the boys to know that. There was a period of great love between them.\"", "images":
