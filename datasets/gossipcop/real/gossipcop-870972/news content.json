That document was enough for the judge to grant her a permanent restraining order against Thomas Hummel.\n\nHe must stay at least 100 yards away and he's forbidden from trying to contact her in any way, shape or form for 3 years. Thomas also can't own any guns during that time.\n\nTMZ broke the story ... back in July, Kendall said she needed protection from Thomas because he was flooding her mailbox with love letters that later turned hostile -- he went from professing his love for her to calling her \"an internet whore.\"", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/f6/16by9/2025/11/20/f6daf71302a54f738a5b3fc991c0067a_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/8f/o/2017/08/02/8fe53525a1f35b24be81f2ba545fd4bf_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/75/16by9/2017/08/02/751e95ec698559fc852c0d78bbec2700_xl.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/71/16by9/2017/06/13/71c441cc83945c8582fbd93641943a58_xs.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/thirtymilezone.svg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e3/16by9/2025/11/20/e3028a12684b463faee721ff211e9954_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/0f/16by9/2025/11/20/0fe06478a3e241edaa03423e7f006606_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/de/4by3/2025/11/19/def9d7aac6b04006a89c0cf3fb46eb21_xxs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/ad/16by9/2017/07/20/adcf2863dce85f5ea7bedd3a7827100e_xs.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/e4/16by9/2025/11/20/e4ccda421f7140fb91551c634a62d9dc_xs.jpg", "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/img/article/google-preferred-source.png", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/c9/16by9/2017/08/02/c952dc7b94a55621b7d1500dafb1f29d_md.jpg", "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/72/16by9/2025/11/20/726f88d680674fccaa77ad055cd10d2e_xs.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/75/16by9/2017/08/02/751e95ec698559fc852c0d78bbec2700_xl.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.tmz.com/2017/08/02/kendall-jenner-permanent-restraining-order-obsessed-fan/", "title": "Kendall Jenner Gets Permanent Restraining Order Against Obsessed Fan", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=0.25,maximum-scale=10", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "google-site-verification": "UUmtbUBf3djgPpCeLefe_PbFsOc6JGxfXmHzpjFLAEQ", "verify-v1": "Wtpd0N6FufoE2XqopQJoTjWV6Co/Mny9BTaswPJbPPA=", "msvalidate.01": "AFEB17971BCF30779AEA662782EF26F4", "y_key": "14cb04e4656b0c58", "p": {"domain_verify": "933e74ace98032aadbc3328616280038"}, "robots": "index,follow,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kendall Jenner might finally get some peace of mind.", "fb": {"app_id": 310610065699820}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/tmz"}, "og": {"site_name": "TMZ", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.tmz.com/2017/08/02/kendall-jenner-permanent-restraining-order-obsessed-fan/", "title": "Kendall Jenner Gets Permanent Restraining Order Against Obsessed Fan", "description": "Kendall Jenner might finally get some peace of mind.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/75/16by9/2017/08/02/751e95ec698559fc852c0d78bbec2700_xl.jpg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TMZ", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kendall Jenner Gets Permanent Restraining Order Against Obsessed Fan", "description": "Kendall Jenner might finally get some peace of mind.", "image": "https://imagez.tmz.com/image/75/16by9/2017/08/02/751e95ec698559fc852c0d78bbec2700_xl.jpg"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=299948601, app-argument=https://www.tmz.com/2017/08/02/kendall-jenner-permanent-restraining-order-obsessed-fan/?tmz#article", "application-name": "TMZ.COM", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "TMZ.COM", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/msapplication-tile-image-270x270-v1.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.tmz.com/?adid=IE9pin", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#000000", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-tooltip": "TMZ | Entertainment News", "msapplication-task": "name=Photos;action-uri=https://www.tmz.com/photos/;icon-uri=https://static.tmz.com/tmz-web/icons/favicon-32x32-v1.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501646400.0, "source": "https://www.tmz.com", "summary": ""}
