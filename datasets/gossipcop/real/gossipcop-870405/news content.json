That same year, the magazine also listed him as the second-highest-paid actor in the world, with earnings of $71.5 million.[265] He was again listed by Forbes as the second-highest-paid actor in the world in 2024, with earnings of $85 million.[266] Reynolds's sex appeal has been discussed in the media. Reynolds was featured in People's Sexiest Men Alive lists in 2007 and 2009[267][268] before being named Sexiest Man Alive in 2010.[269] In 2024, he was included on Harper's Bazaar's list of the 50 Hottest Men of All Time.[270] As of September 2025, Reynolds's films have grossed over $6.6 billion worldwide according to The Numbers.[271]\n\nSeveral critics have noted Reynolds for his simple sense of style. GQ thought that his \"go-tos are straightforward, almost to the point where they resist description: nondescript tees, uncomplicated jackets, closely tailored trousers, and cool but not hype-y sneakers\".[272] Christine Flammia from men's magazine Esquire appreciated his \"accessible\" style and called him the \"king of outfit repeating\".[273] Reynolds often \"keeps things simple\" according to British GQ and usually wears \"three-piece suits and black velvet tuxes \u00e0 la nuit and earthy-hued bomber jackets au jour\".[274]\n\nIt Ends with Us controversy\n\nThe production of It Ends with Us (2024) became embroiled in controversy due to conflicts between Lively and the film's director, Justin Baldoni.[275][276] According to Lively, Reynolds wrote a significant portion of dialogue for a rooftop scene featuring her in April 2023 without Baldoni's knowledge.[277][278] Speculation about a rift between Lively and Baldoni grew on social media, particularly on TikTok, where the book of the same name had gained massive popularity within the BookTok community.[279]\n\nOn January 16, 2025, Baldoni filed a $400 million civil lawsuit against Reynolds and Lively, alleging extortion, defamation, and invasion of privacy.[280][281] The lawsuit claims that Lively threatened to make false sexual harassment allegations and withdraw from the production to gain creative control over the film, ultimately excluding Baldoni from the process and barring him from the film's premiere.[282][283][284] Baldoni further asserted that Lively, Reynolds, and their publicist engaged in a coordinated effort to damage his reputation and shift the film's focus away from raising awareness about domestic violence.[285] In response, Reynolds filed a motion to be dismissed from Baldoni's lawsuit in March 2025, claiming to have no involvement in the matter outside of supporting Lively. He also rejected the claim that the character Nicepool (as portrayed in Deadpool & Wolverine) was a caricature of Baldoni.[286][287]\n\nPersonal life\n\nReynolds began dating singer Alanis Morissette in 2002 after meeting her at Drew Barrymore's birthday party, and the couple announced their engagement in 2004.[288] In February 2007, their representatives confirmed they had mutually decided to call their engagement off.[289] Morissette later revealed that her seventh studio album Flavors of Entanglement (2008) was inspired by the heartbreak of their break-up, with the song \"Torch\" specifically written about Reynolds.[290][291] Shortly after his breakup with Morissette, Reynolds began dating actress Scarlett Johansson in April 2007.[292] The couple announced their engagement in May 2008[293][294] and married in September of that year in a private ceremony in Vancouver Island.[295][296] On December 14, 2010, they announced their separation.[297][298][292] They filed for divorce in Los Angeles on December 23.[299][300] Their divorce was finalized in July 2011.[301][302]\n\nReynolds first met Lively in July 2010 while filming Green Lantern (2011), in which they costarred.[303][304] They began dating in October 2011 and married on September 9, 2012, at Boone Hall Plantation in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.[303] Following civil rights protests in 2020, Reynolds publicly apologized and expressed deep regret for choosing a venue with ties to slavery. The couple later renewed their vows at home in New York.[305][306][307] They have four children together\u2014three daughters and a son.[308] The family lives in Pound Ridge, New York.[309] Reynolds and Lively are close friends with singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, who named the characters in her 2020 song \"Betty\" after their daughters.[310] In November 2024, Reynolds confirmed that Swift is the godmother to his three daughters.[311] He is also close friends with Hugh Jackman, whom he credits for introducing him to Levy\u2014the director of three of his films.[312]\n\nReynolds's father, James, died in 2015 following a twenty-year battle with Parkinson's disease.[313] Reynolds said that he used humour as a way to process his grief, stating that he and his siblings were making their father laugh during his final moments. He also said that portraying Deadpool contributed to his process of grieving, and that becoming a parent has helped reconcile his complex relationship with his deceased father.[314][315] Reynolds has openly discussed his lifelong struggle with anxiety,[316][317] revealing in 2018 that he often conducted interviews in character as Deadpool to help manage his fears.[318] In 2024, he reiterated that his anxiety makes him \"quiet\" and \"shy\" outside of acting.[312] He attained American citizenship around 2018, and voted for the first time in the 2020 presidential election.[319]\n\nActing credits
