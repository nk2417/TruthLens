The Revenge Body host, 33, shared her \u201cexact pregnancy workout\u201d on her website on Friday, January 12.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so lucky that I\u2019ve been able to stay active during my pregnancy,\u201d Kardashian wrote. \u201cIf I\u2019m not doing something, I just feel off, ya know? I can\u2019t beast out in the gym the way I could six months ago \u2014 and, let\u2019s get real, it\u2019ll be a few more months before I can again \u2014 but I\u2019m definitely doing what I can.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Khloe Kardashian Snapchats\u2755 (@khloesnapchats) on Dec 28, 2017 at 3:06pm PST\n\nRelated: Khloe Kardashian\u2019s Comfortably Chic Maternity Style With her due date right around the corner, Khloe Kardashian is dealing with cheating rumors related to her boyfriend Tristan Thompson spending time with a mystery woman in NYC. It\u2019s a sad end to what has otherwise been such a seemingly happy pregnancy for the reality star. Since she announced that she was expecting her [\u2026]\n\nThe Keeping Up With the Kardashians star warms up with cardio, specifically 30 minutes on the stair-climber followed by circuit training. Next, she pairs shoulder raises with squats. \u201cNothing\u2019s better than a move with a dual purpose, right?\u201d she wrote. \u201cFor this one, I do a dumbbell press above my head and, as my arms come back down, I drop into a squat. Continue this for 30 seconds for one set \u2014 and then do three more!\u201d\n\nKardashian then does what she calls a \u201cpush-up shoulder tap.\u201d She does a traditional push-up and then taps her shoulders with opposing hands before lowering herself down once again. \u201cThis move works your arms and chest of course, but also your core,\u201d she explained.\n\nRelated: Cutest Kardashian Kids Moments Kim, Rob and Kourtney Kardashian have the cutest kids \u2014 see photos of cousins North and Saint West, Dream Kardashian and Mason, Penelope and Reign Disick!\n\nNext, the Good American denim designer does a lateral duck walk with resistance. Translation: She places a resistance band above her knees and hangs onto a TRX strap. Then, she takes three steps to the left, stops to do a pull-up, moves three steps to the right and stops for another pull-up. She does three sets of 30-second intervals.\n\nThen comes two tough workouts: battle ropes and chest presses on a balance ball. For the latter, Kardashian rests her upper body on the ball with her feet shoulder-width apart for stability. \u201cI do 30 chest presses with a dumbbell in each hand for a total of three sets,\u201d she wrote.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Workout Style Getting dressed is half the battle of hitting the gym, so take inspiration from these fit celebs, including Hilary Duff, Reese Witherspoon, Vanessa Hudgens and more\n\nFor her final two exercises, the reality star holds a squat for a full minute while engaging her glutes by pressing out the resistance band above her knees. Finally, she does a set of planks.\n\nUs Weekly exclusively revealed last September that Kardashian is expecting her first child, a boy, with her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson. After being criticized on social media in December for working out while pregnant, she responded on Twitter, \u201cMY doctor and I communicate and my workouts are cleared and highly recommended.
