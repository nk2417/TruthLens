Earlier this summer, Teigen joined her husband on stage during a concert and suffered a wardrobe malfunction that would have left anyone else red-faced and embarrassed \u2014 but not those two.\n\nTeigen and Legend were bumping and grinding onstage while Legend sang his hit \u201cSlow Dance\u201d when Teigen\u2019s black floor-length dress moved, revealing one of her breasts.
