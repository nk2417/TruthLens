But when it does, it'll be without Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e, who directed all seven episodes of Season 1.\n\n\"We are so deeply grateful to Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e: his vision and his artistry... he put his heart and soul into this,\" star/executive producer Reese Witherspoon told reporters backstage in the Globes press room. But when they started planning for Season 2, she says, \"unfortunately, he was busy. We did try to accommodate him, but we did want to get the season started soon, because I think the people want it soon.\"\n\nInstead, director Andrea Arnold (Transparent, I Love Dick) will helm Season 2's episodes, and Witherspoon is excited to see what she comes up with when the Monterey moms' stories continue: \"We're just thrilled to welcome her to our family. And we're just thrilled we get to do this again together.\"", "images": ["https://www.tvline.com/img/TVLine-Icon-RGB-Default-Color.svg", "https://www.tvline.com/img/TVLine-Logo-RGB-Default-Color.svg", "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/awards/big-little-lies-season-2-director-hbo-golden-globes-902860/big-little-lies-season-2-hbo.png.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/awards/big-little-lies-season-2-director-hbo-golden-globes-902860/big-little-lies-season-2-hbo.png.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Nemetz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.tvline.com/awards/big-little-lies-season-2-director-hbo-golden-globes-902860/", "title": "'Big Little Lies': Why It's Switching Directors For Season 2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "thumbnail": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/awards/big-little-lies-season-2-director-hbo-golden-globes-902860/big-little-lies-season-2-hbo.png.jpg", "description": "The \"Big Little Lies\" team explains why they'll welcome a new director for Season 2, following its big night at the Golden Globes.", "mrf": {"tags": "Content Type:Legacy Article;Primary Category:Television;Category:Television;Headline Approver:Unknown;Trello Board:Legacy"}, "og": {"site_name": "TVLine", "title": "Golden Globes: Why Big Little Lies Is Switching Directors For Season 2 - TVLine", "image": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/awards/big-little-lies-season-2-director-hbo-golden-globes-902860/big-little-lies-season-2-hbo.png.jpg", "description": "The \"Big Little Lies\" team explains why they'll welcome a new director for Season 2, following its big night at the Golden Globes.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.tvline.com/awards/big-little-lies-season-2-director-hbo-golden-globes-902860/"}, "twitter": {"title": "Golden Globes: Why Big Little Lies Is Switching Directors For Season 2 - TVLine", "description": "The \"Big Little Lies\" team explains why they'll welcome a new director for Season 2, following its big night at the Golden Globes.", "site": "@TVLine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.tvline.com/tvline/awards/big-little-lies-season-2-director-hbo-golden-globes-902860/big-little-lies-season-2-hbo.png.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-08T04:10:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-08T04:25:12+00:00", "author": "Dave Nemetz"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515301200.0, "source": "https://tvline.com", "summary": ""}
