Kash is his favorite. It made absolutely no sense to any of us. This is nothing I ever thought I\u2019d be dealing with in my life.\u201d\n\nThough Kim shared news about the bite on social media after it happened, much of the details surrounding the incident have been unknown until now \u2014 including the fact that Sinn was the one who bit Kash. The two were playing outside alongside the Biermanns\u2019 other son KJ, 6, when Kroy was using a leaf blower to clean the yard.\n\n\u201cSinn doesn\u2019t like the blower, so he\u2019s already in high alert,\u201d Kroy, 32, says on Friday\u2019s episode of Don\u2019t Be Tardy, which documents the aftermath of Sinn\u2019s bite. \u201cMy back was to the dogs and the boys. I hear Kash be loud, and then I hear barking. And then I hear Kash screaming, he\u2019s crying very loud. At that point I think he\u2019s scared, but then I realize Sinn bit Kash. He\u2019s dripping blood everywhere on his shirt. He pulls his hands down and there\u2019s multiple lacerations, I can\u2019t see his eye. I knew it was a very dire emergency.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Kim Zolciak-Biermann\n\nLooking back on it to PEOPLE, Kroy says he\u2019s still coming to terms with what happened. \u201cIt\u2019s a process every day,\u201d Kroy explains. \u201cBeing right there, it was just wrong place, wrong time, wrong circumstances. The perfect storm. Had one thing been different, it wouldn\u2019t have happened. You try to say, \u2018What would I have done differently?\u2019 And there are a lot of things. now, but you can\u2019t change any of it. You just have to learn from it and grow from it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are no words to describe something like this,\u201d Kroy continues. \u201cI just pray that any parent out there does not have to go through anything traumatic like it. It\u2019s just a horrible feeling to have to go through.\u201d\n\nAs Kash was taken to the hospital, Sinn\u2019s trainer immediately came to the Biermann house and removed the dog from the home while Kim and Kroy \u2014 who have six kids total and four other rescue dogs \u2014 decided what to do.\n\nCourtesy Kim Zolciak-Biermann\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Zolciak-Biermann Surprises Son Kash With Pit Bull Puppy Four Months After Dog Attack\n\nThe decision to keep Sinn didn\u2019t come easy. The Biermanns had rescued Sinn, husky-boxer mix, as a puppy three years earlier. Kroy\u2019s instinct was to get rid him now.\n\n\u201cI hated Sinn,\u201d Kroy says. \u201cI genuinely felt a deep rage for what he had done to my son. Sinn was always a good dog, extremely obedient and protective and not at all aggressive. He\u2019s hyper-active and hyper-sensitive but wants to work and loves to be commanded. I love my dog, and nothing like this had ever happened to me before. But it\u2019s my son. I don\u2019t love anything more than my flesh and blood. I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t want to see the dog \u2014 he doesn\u2019t get a second chance.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFor more on Kim Zolciak-Biermann and Kroy Biermann, pick up this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.\n\nComplicating matters was the fact that over the years, Sinn had formed an \u201cincredible bond\u201d with Kash. \u201cSinn and Kash have been best friends since the day we got Sinn,\u201d Kim says. \u201cKash is an absolute animal lover, and Sinn is definitely his favorite, without a shadow of a doubt. That\u2019s why it was extra hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI genuinely felt a deep rage for what Sinn had done to my son, but Kash loves him,\u201d Kroy adds.\u201d We didn\u2019t want him to live a life with a phobia of dogs. We wanted him to understand it wasn\u2019t his fault.\u201d\n\nSource: Kim Zolciak-Biermann Instagram\n\nSpeaking with nearly a dozen behavioral specialists, child psychologists and dog-bite survivors, Kim and Kroy spent a lot of time evaluating Kash\u2019s moods and anxiety level after the attack. The boy \u2014 who the Biermanns describe as \u201csuper strong and positive\u201d \u2014 appeared unfazed, even asking to see Sinn while he was in the hospital.\n\n\u201cHe saw a service dog in the hospital and he hopped up out of the bed. He was all over the dog, petting the dog and loving on the dog and kissing the dog with no inhibitions,\u201d Kim remembers. \u201cIt was unbelievable.\u201d\n\nWhat finally clicked for the Biermanns was when they understood that Kash had been bitten, not attacked. \u201cThat was a turning point for me,\u201d Kim says, revealing they watched security camera footage of the incident. \u201cIt was not an attack \u2014 he nipped at Kash\u2019s face in an attempt to communicate with Kash. Not that that is an excuse. But he took off running. It wasn\u2019t as if he was attacking. Sinn knew he had done wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf Kash ever looked at me and said that he didn\u2019t want to be around Sinn or showed any hesitation, then he wouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d Kim stresses. \u201cWe love Sinn, he\u2019s part of our family, but our children will always come first without a doubt.\u201d\n\nSource: Kim Zolciak Biermann/Instagram\n\nSeven months and multiple surgeries later, Kash is healthy and 95 percent healed \u2014 even getting a puppy for his birthday in August. And after an eight-week break, Sinn was slowly welcomed back into the home, with some very big changes.\n\n\u201cSinn had a lot of freedom before. He would sleep in the crate at night, but during the day he would roam around the house or we\u2019d let him outside. Nobody really watched him. Now his crate is locked with a key that only Kim and I have the keys to. He\u2019s supervised all the time when he\u2019s out. And the only time he runs around free is in the fenced-in dog run we built for him the backyard, which gives him about 400 sq. ft. of grassed space,\u201d Kroy says.\n\nThe dog\u2019s crate has also been moved out of the home\u2019s high-traffic area to give Sinn some sanctuary. He occasionally wears a muzzle, too.\n\nCourtesy Kim Zolciak-Biermann\n\nRELATED VIDEO: \u2018I Don\u2019t Know Where to Start\u2019: Kim Zolciak-Biermann\u2019s 4-Year-Old Son Hospitalized After Being Bitten by Dog\n\nStill, the biggest change has been that Kim and Kroy now know what to look out for \u2014 and hope that viewers learn from their nightmare.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taught our kids, no matter how nice dogs are, they are capable of anything and cannot communicate to us in another way than through action \u2014 be it barking, growling, biting, scratching, or running away,\u201d Kroy says. \u201cA child sees flurry, fluffy, fun, slobbery \u2026 they don\u2019t see danger. And we didn\u2019t either, as adults who had always owned dogs but never gone through something like this. But you have to understand those triggers. Whether it\u2019s loud noise, their tail being pulled, whatever it is, it should be on the forefront of everybody\u2019s mind. Not as fear, but just awareness.\u201d\n\nAll and all, the Biermanns are grateful for all the support they received from family and friends, especially Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta, Dr. Jerry E Berland at Thomas Eye Group, Chief of Plastic Surgery at CHOA Dr. Joseph K Williams and Gabe Reinlieb at Tenacity Dog Training. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know what we would of done without them,\u201d Kim says.Don\u2019t Be Tardy airs Fridays (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.", "images":
