Maryse Ouellet had some exciting baby news for Mike \u201cThe Miz\u201d Mizanin on Wednesday\u2019s episode of Total Divas, and the WWE star\u2019s reaction is priceless.\n\n\u201cMike has been on the road. I haven\u2019t seen him in a few days and I\u2019m feeling tired,\u201d Maryse says in a confessional. \u201cI feel like I need to nap all the time and it\u2019s just not like me. This has been the longest 48 hours of my life.\u201d\n\nVideos by PopCulture.com\n\nAfter Mike gets home, Maryse chats nervously with her husband while he chows down before saying he\u2019s heading to bed.\n\n\u201cI wanted to talk to you about something before you go to bed,\u201d the WWE Diva tells her hubby. \u201cActually, I\u2019ve been trying to talk to you for 48 hours now, but I wanted to see you in person.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Mike asks worriedly. \u201cYou OK?\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s at this moment that Maryse whips out a positive pregnancy test, saying, \u201cCongratulations, dad!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re kidding?\u201d Mike asks. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m one hundred percent pregnant,\u201d she tells him, pulling out a ton more positive tests..\n\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d Mike says.\u201dWe weren\u2019t even trying!\u201d\n\nAfter asking a few questions in shock about the legitimacy of pregnancy tests, reality seems to set in on the wrestler.\n\n\u201cWow, I\u2019m gonna be a dad,\u201d he says, rising to kiss his bride. \u201cCongratulations mom!\u201d\n\nWhen Maryse asks what\u2019s behind his somewhat glazed look, he reveals the surprise has left him with a lot of conflicting emotions.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m speechless; I\u2019m happy; I\u2019m nervous; I\u2019m scared,\u201d he tells her. \u201cThis is kind of an interesting time too.\u201d\n\nMaryse waves off his concerns, saying the couple will figure it out as they go. But privately, she has her concerns.\n\n\u201cYou know when they say timing is everything, well timing is everything,\u201d she tells cameras. \u201cMy career is doing phenomenal, Mike\u2019s career is doing phenomenal \u2026 I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen now.\u201d\n\nShe continues, \u201cI\u2019m pregnant and I work in a very physical company, like it\u2019s WWE.
