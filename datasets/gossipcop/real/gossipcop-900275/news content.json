{"url": "https://people.com/home/hgtv-star-carter-oosterhouse-sexual-misconduct-allegations/", "text": "UPDATE: In a statement to PEOPLE Friday afternoon, a spokesperson for HGTV said, \u201cWhile we have not been in production with Carter Oosterhouse on an HGTV series for many years, we take matters such as this very seriously. We do not tolerate harassment of any kind.\u201d\n\nIn a second statement, the spokesperson elaborated, \u201cWe won\u2019t comment on the details of any specific situation, but we work alongside our independent production partners to investigate any allegations and take action where appropriate.\u201d Carter Can was produced by High Noon Entertainment, which is behind several series on HGTV, TLC and Food Network, among others.\n\nCarter Oosterhouse, the HGTV host and star of TLC\u2019s Trading Spaces, has been accused of sexual misconduct by a former employee.\n\nA former makeup artist from the show, Kailey Kaminsky, told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview that she worked with Oosterhouse as his makeup artist in 2008. She alleged that he had coerced her into performing repeated oral sex acts during the show\u2019s production.\n\nShe claimed the experiences led to her hospitalization for depression and unemployment from the show.\n\n\u201cAt that point, I was a nervous wreck. I was so worn down from his advances, so I did: that day, on that occasion,\u201d she said, admitting she agreed to his demands after he allegedly threatened her employment. \u201cIt was the first time. Then thereafter it was almost every time we would shoot \u2014 10 to 15 times he put me in this position.\u201d\n\nOosterhouse, 41, who also serves as the host of ABC\u2019s The Great Christmas Light Fight, denied anything between him and Kaminsky was not consensual. In a statement to PEOPLE, the carpenter and TV personality said he is \u201cvery passionate about what is happening right now with the #metoo movement, especially because I have so many strong women in my life, like my wife, mother, sister and of course my little baby girl. We are in a time of change for society and I am behind it 100%.\u201d\n\nOosterhouse has been married to actress Amy Smart since 2011 and shares 11-month-old daughter Flora with her.\n\nThe HGTV star said he \u201chad an intimate relationship with Kailey 9 years ago and it was 100% mutual and consensual. In no way did I ever feel, nor was it ever indicated to me, that Kailey was uncomfortable during out intimate relationship. I would have never done anything that I was not sure was mutually agreeable.\u201d\n\nDavid Livingston/Getty\n\nOosterhouse claimed Kaminsky initiated their relationship the first time including \u201cthe 15 or so times we had relations thereafter.\u201d\n\nKaminsky said the demands for oral sex came from Oosterhouse a year into her employment after he had gained fame from Trading Spaces.\n\nShe told THR he propositioned her while they were both running errands during a location shoot in his hometown of Traverse City, Michigan \u2014 which she found surprising because she said she identifies as a lesbian.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018You know what would be a good idea?\u2019 If you went down on me,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cI was shocked \u2014 it was so random. I said, in my sarcastic way, \u2018Well, that\u2019s not sexual harassment at all.\u2019 He said, \u2018I just think it would be fun.\u2019 I made it clear that I did not think it would be fun. Still, I thought he was just goofing around.\u201d\n\nDespite her refusals, Kaminsky told the outlet Oosterhouse continued to request oral sex from her until one day an encounter left her reeling.\n\nWhile on the way to a project site, she said, he pulled over and asked her, \u201c\u2019Do you enjoy your job? I said I did and in fact would like to work more, handling more of his personal appearances outside of the show. He said, \u2018Well, I can help you with that. But you need to do something for me.\u2019\u201d\n\nKaminsky said she interpreted the conversation as affecting her livelihood, and said she agreed to a sexual relationship with him.\n\nDespite this, she told THR that there was no reciprocal physical intimacy and that \u201cwhen he would assault me, he insisted on finishing on my face \u2014 every time \u2014 knowing that I had to go back out and work. I asked him about that. He said, \u2018It\u2019s just what I wanted to do.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe said the stress of the encounters led her to develop anxiety that caused her to be away from her job for a week.\n\n\u201cI developed this stomach ulcer, something I\u2019d never had before, and was hospitalized for a week,\u201d she said. \u201cI kept beating myself up psychologically \u2014 that I was nothing but a prostitute. And the longer this went on, the less he would allow me to do my job. If I wanted to step in and touch up his hair and powder, he would push me away.\u201d\n\nKaminsky claimed Patrick Jager, the director Carter Can, said her absence was the reason she was replaced for the next season. She said he was unaware of the situation.\n\nOosterhouse said in a statement he \u201cdidn\u2019t have anything to do with her not being invited back to the show \u2014 that was a producer decision. And as for the fact that she identifies as a lesbian \u2014 I didn\u2019t know that \u2014 all I knew was that she was in a sexual relationship with another guy who worked on the show.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting that she now feels this way, I only wish her the best and truly hope that she can move forward.\u201d\n\nA year after she left the show, Kaminsky told an official at its production company about the allegations. She said Oosterhouse called her and apologized, saying, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I thought it was mutual.\u201d\n\nOosterhouse later told THR, \u201cI did say I thought it was mutual \u2014 because it was. I didn\u2019t apologize because I never did anything wrong. That\u2019s the God\u2019s honest truth. I felt bad that she was, in that moment, not-super-positive.\u201d\n\nThe former makeup artist told the publication she had described the encounters to two female producers on the show and \u201cdefinitely went out of my way to pretend it was something that I was participating in willfully.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was Stockholm Syndrome-y, justifying what you\u2019re doing,\u201d she added.\n\nOne of the producers told the publication she thought Kaminsky\u2019s relationship with Oosterhouse was consensual and \u201cdidn\u2019t seem like it was abusive.\u201d\n\nOosterhouse is slated to appear in TLC\u2019s reboot of Trading Spaces, airing in spring 2018.", "images":
