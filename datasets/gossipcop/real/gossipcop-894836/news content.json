Here's one possibility: During a recent episode of Bravo's Watch What Happens Live, a fan basically begged Pink to team up with Clarkson for a remake of Barba Streisand and Donna Summer's 1979 jam \"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough),\" which prompted Pink to profess her admiration for the original American Idol winner.\n\n\"If I did a song with Kelly Clarkson, I would get outsung,\" Pink told host Andy Cohen \u2014 a fear she apparently conquered prior to Sunday's performance.\n\nSo, did Pink and Clarkson's duet live up to the hype?
