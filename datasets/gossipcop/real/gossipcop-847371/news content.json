Here was Prince William\u2019s university sweetheart, a commoner from the Home Counties who had married the world\u2019s most eligible prince in a fairy-tale wedding just a year earlier, taking her place alongside the line of succession and making history.\n\nAs the Queen of England stood flanked by the two men she refers to as \u201cmy substitutes\u201d\u2014her son the Prince of Wales and her grandson Prince William\u2014she sent out a powerful message about the future of the newly streamlined British monarchy. There, alongside Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Prince Harry, was Kate. Resplendent in a champagne lace Alexander McQueen dress, a jaunty Jane Taylor hat, and her trademark L. K. Bennett nude stiletto heels, she looked entirely natural and at ease. The young woman, who just years earlier had been known as \u201cWaity Katie,\u201d was now at the forefront of the world\u2019s most famous family.\n\nKate is the embodiment of a \u201cPeople\u2019s Princess\u201d and\u2014like William\u2019s late mother, Diana, the Princess of Wales, and the forebear of that title\u2014a world-renowned style icon. Over the past year, she has certainly proved to be the rising star of the monarchy, which is still riding high following the enormous success of the royal wedding\u2014watched by a global audience of two billion\u2014and the Queen\u2019s recent Diamond Jubilee. Both events reprised a wave of affection the royal family feared it might never again experience.\n\nThose close to William, who turned 30 on June 21, say that he has never been happier. While his birthright and sense of responsibility used to weigh heavily on his shoulders, William is now optimistic about his destiny, and ready to embrace it. \u201cThere\u2019s a happiness in the House of Windsor generally at the moment for the first time ever,\u201d says a family friend. \u201cCharles and Camilla are genuinely happy. William is happy because Charles is troubled less, and he has Kate to share his future with.\u201d\n\nLike William, the Queen is said to be acutely aware that there must be no repeat of the past. The late Princess of Wales often complained that she felt like an outsider as she embarked on her new life as a working royal alongside the older and more seasoned Charles. Kate, in contrast, has been both better prepared and supported by her husband, whom she has described as a \u201cgreat teacher.\u201d She has taken to royal life like a duck to water. While she enjoys staying at the royal residences of Sandringham, in Norfolk, and Balmoral, in Scotland, she is said to find the constant clothes changes (up to five a day if the itinerary includes shooting, tea, and a formal dinner) and the omnipresence of a full household of staff rather stressful. The duchess is also still getting used to royal protocol, and a recent revision to the Order of Precedence, a document which outlines royal etiquette and protocol, was circulated to assist her. The \u201crules\u201d were last revised when Camilla married Charles, and it is understood the Queen wanted them to be updated following Kate\u2019s entry into \u201cthe Firm,\u201d as the royal family refers to itself. According to protocol, if William is not present Kate is expected to curtsy to all senior members of the family, including blood princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, and she is always expected to curtsy to Camilla and the Prince of Wales. While the antiquated guidelines are not always adhered to, the Queen believes they are fundamental to the underpinning of the family, and Kate always ensures that she curtsies to the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. Apparently in private she is close enough to Camilla that there is no need to curtsy, nor does she defer to William\u2019s cousins unless it is required at a formal occasion, according to one family member.\n\nWhile Kate is keen to cut her teeth as a working royal, William has told aides not to overbook the couple\u2019s diaries. The Queen promised the couple a two-year grace period from public life after the wedding so that they could enjoy the early years of their newly married life, just as she and Prince Philip did when he was serving as a naval officer in Malta. Since the summer of 2010, William and Kate have lived on the Welsh island of Anglesey, in a rented five-bedroom farmhouse close to R.A.F. Valley where William is serving as a search-and-rescue pilot with the Royal Air Force. The place is surrounded by thick woodland and is a short walk from the beach, where the couple walk their new cocker-spaniel puppy, Lupo. \u201cIt\u2019s all very normal. The last time I went round, William was pottering around making tea and toast, very chilled and relaxed,\u201d says one of their friends. When they do venture out, the locals are incredibly protective of them. \u201cPeople around here have taken them to their hearts. You won\u2019t catch anyone tweeting gossip about them as they go about their day-to-day business,\u201d says Jack Abbott, chairman of the Trearddur Bay R.N.L.I. lifeboat station, where the couple carried out one of their first joint engagements.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68fa686659389b4cea701e19/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e55b2c48e51f42566b396/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54ca93f651062027081e57d9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54ca93f651062027081e57d7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691cd91f9f3eb60315ac3531/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57d1e95850198fb52857665c/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/kate-middleton-name-question-christopher-wahl.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62fe7ae3f9f2d6c81700a52c/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691388cbb0b7e0bbf578f04e/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690e0b6136f4223ffe5015ef/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690a5ee0da787343f1849201/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/69163ff8fd759a5ca922c157/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Footer.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6903bca7d353cca0e86410a6/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690a2457c9b01443eb632273/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/690bcf4cd862d6f327955a94/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanityfair-global/assets/VF_Logo_Inverted_Header.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/691b63b86201973f77db4e40/4:3/w_1200%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54ca93f651062027081e57d7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Nicholl"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2012/09/kate-middletons-married-life-house-facials", "title": "Inside Kate Middleton\u2019s Domestic Life: The House, the Facials, the Roast-Chicken Recipe", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "author": "Katie Nicholl", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2025", "description": "Just one after her wedding, the Duchess of Cambridge already seems to the palace born.
