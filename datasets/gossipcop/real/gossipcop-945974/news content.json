It made her appreciate her loved ones and her life more than ever and caused her to\u2014for years\u2014simplify her style, eschewing flashy jewelry and major displays of wealth.\n\n\u201cAfter I was robbed in Paris,\u201d she said in an episode of The Kardashians at the time, \u201cI haven\u2019t bought jewelry.\u201d\n\nBut now that she\u2019s back in the French capital to face her robbers in court, she\u2019s no longer hiding.\n\nYesterday, Kardashian arrived at the Palais de Justice, accompanied by her mother, Kris Jenner, to confront the 10 people accused in the robbery. For the court appearance, nine years in the making, the Skims founder wore a dramatic black vintage gown from John Galliano, pointy slingbacks from Saint Laurent, and $7 million worth of diamond jewelry.\n\nThe Mega Agency\n\nKardashian forgave her robbers in court while decked out in the gleaming diamonds. \u201cI\u2019m obviously emotional about it. This experience changed my life, and it changed my family\u2019s life,\u201d she said after an apology note from one of the defendants was read aloud. \u201cI do appreciate the letter, I forgive you for what has taken place, but it doesn\u2019t change the emotion and the feelings and the trauma\u2014the way my life is forever changed.\u201d\n\nAfter the court appointment, Kardashian stepped out for a lavish dinner at Le Voltaire, where she brought the drama in a luxurious brown look. This one was composed of a sheer chocolate slipdress with barely there spaghetti straps, from John Galliano, and a shaggy caramel-brown fur coat from Saint Laurent. She capped off the fit with chocolate peep-toe heels, a matching croc-embossed tote bag, and a diamond anklet.\n\nThe Mega Agency\n\nIt\u2019s giving healed.", "images":
