Impact Link\n\nReality cooking competition shows like \"Masterchef\" or \"The Great British Baking Show\" typically feature amateurs who perform at, or even above, the level professionals do.\n\nOne series by Netflix has abandoned this formula to celebrate imperfection. \"Nailed It!\" challenges amateur bakers to create elaborate cakes, desserts, and more. The show gets its name from a popular meme in which people document their wildly unsuccessful attempts to follow Pinterest recipes. In each episode, the contestant who most closely replicates professional results wins $10,000.\n\nBut, unlike other shows, no one on \"Nailed It!\" really ever gets that close \u2014 and that's the entire point. Instead of making it seem like anyone, the viewer included, can expect perfection at home, the show highlights just how complicated Pinterest recipes usually are. Because for most us, these baking \"fails\" are the best we can do, and that's impressive enough.\n\nBelow, take a closer look at some standout creations from the show, which returned for its third season on Friday with six more bingeable episodes.", "images": ["https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg",
