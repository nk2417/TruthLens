And he then banged the phone down. Imagine! To me, his mother!\"\n\nMs Farebrother told the newspaper at the time that she had never met her grandsons Zachary and Elijah, who Sir Elton and his partner David Furnish fathered through IVF with an American surrogate mother.\n\nFor her 90th birthday, Ms Farebrother hired an Elton John tribute act to perform.\n\nHer son got in touch soon after, sending her white orchids to celebrate the milestone.\n\nAllow Instagram content?

Sir Elton told Rolling Stone that his mother had not called him to say thank you after the bouquet arrived.\n\n\"To be honest with you, I don't miss her,\" he said. \"I look after her, but I don't want her in my life.\"\n\nHowever, the pair appear to have fully reconciled this year, after Sir Elton recovered from a potentially fatal bacterial infection.\n\n\"Dear Mum, Happy Mother's Day!\" he wrote on Instagram in February. \"So happy we are back in touch.
