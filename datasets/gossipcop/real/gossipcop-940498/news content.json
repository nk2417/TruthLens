But I think when we started to see the response overseas, that\u2019s when I started to go, \u2018Oh, wow, this is a big deal\u2019.\n\nLegendary director Quentin Tarantino gushed about the film, saying it was the \u2018kind of movie the whole world was waiting to see\u2019.\n\nBlack Panther is seen as a phenomenon \u2013 a cultural benchmark \u2013 and it became the highest grossing superhero ever in the US.\n\nFor the T\u2019Challa actor, the film\u2019s success meant more than just numbers and records \u2013 it changed the face of blockbusters.\n\n\u2018Studios will very often tell you that movies with a black lead are not going to work overseas.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Up Next Previous Page Next Page\n\n\u2018So I think that was the thing for me \u2013 this means something everywhere in the world. I know at that point it could actually change how studios respond to our movies\u2019.\n\nHe added: \u2018You can no longer say definitively, \u2018Black movies don\u2019t work [outside of the US]\u2019.\n\nAnd for all those who are getting T\u2019Challa and Dora Milaje withdrawal symptoms \u2013 don\u2019t fret.\n\nMarvel Studios President Kevin Feige confirmed that there will be a sequel (yes!).\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly about the possibility of a Black Panther 2, he said:\u2019We absolutely will do that\u2019.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
