I felt heavy and hollow \u2026 We had filmed the last season with my character, Lisa, pregnant so she either has the baby or she doesn\u2019t. Both seemed merciless. I told him I\u2019m at my lowest. I can\u2019t imagine playing anything other than where I\u2019m at. If I can turn this into \u2026 something. He asked if I was sure and I said let\u2019s lean in.\u201d\n\nRelated: Just Like Us: Celebrity Moms From grocery shopping to bonding with their kids, see how star mamas spend their day\n\nSanchez\u2019s Kingdom character, Lisa, ended up having a miscarriage like Sanchez.\n\n\u201cIt ended up being cathartic.
