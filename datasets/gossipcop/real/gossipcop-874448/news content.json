{"url": "https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2017/8/18/16169342/taylor-swift-social-media-black-out-reddit-theories", "text": "Around 11AM ET, all traces of Taylor Swift disappeared from Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr, and her official website.\n\nShe\u2019s been relatively quiet on social media all year, and last fall she broke with her tradition of releasing an album every other October. So, fans and amateur sleuths started digging through the source code of her website within minutes, looking for clues as to what was going on. Some guessed new music; some guessed a hack. Then Tumblr spat out hundreds of screenshots of the same dubious-looking DirecTV Now listing of a Swift appearance on tomorrow\u2019s Good Morning America. There\u2019s very little evidence to support anyone\u2019s theory, but it\u2019s fun to spend an otherwise-sleepy Friday afternoon trying to sort the riddle out.\n\nAnd though all of the evidence we\u2019re going to see today is definitely baloney, you can see why fans would get dragged into this rabbit hole. The best thing about a new Taylor Swift album is the fact that she leaves hidden messages in all of the liner notes, often with clues about the subject of each song. This recurring treat is gossipy, salacious, and satisfying like a crossword puzzle \u2014 essentially the modus operandi of Swift\u2019s entire career and public persona.\n\nTheory 1: She got hacked\n\nWhile celebrities often wipe their social media accounts before big announcements, it\u2019s strange that Swift\u2019s Instagram and Twitter both show that she now follows no other accounts. That kind of purge isn\u2019t common. Also, this guy says he hacked her:\n\nIt\u2019s very unlikely, given that this post went up about two hours into the online frenzy. Plus, that wouldn\u2019t explain the absence on any other platform, or her site. Swift\u2019s team is notoriously web savvy, pulling down the slightest copyright infringement in minutes and proactively buying up every domain name that could conceivably host porn about her. A security screw-up big enough to take down her entire web presence seems unlikely.\n\nGiven the non-evidence, the possibility of a hack made me nervous for only one second, but I\u2019ve reached out to Swift\u2019s record label and will update if I hear back.\n\nTheory 2: She\u2019s announcing a new album\n\nOn top of all the posts going missing, Swift\u2019s Tumblr theme has changed, from a peachy-pink background with white type to all black. That move has some Tumblr fans pretty worked up, and the hashtag #T6 (for her theoretical sixth album) trending.\n\nIt\u2019s not a ridiculous conclusion. Her website has also gone dark, as it did before she revamped it in 2012 preceding the release of Red, and again in 2014 before the announcement of 1989. \u201cShake it Off,\u201d the lead single of that album, was announced three years ago today, and Swift has a habit of celebrating minor anniversaries and milestones in showy ways. Earlier this summer, she put her entire discography on Spotify to celebrate 1989 selling 10 million copies worldwide.\n\nOnce the idea of new music was floated, Reddit sleuths claimed to have found support for it in the source code of her site. With some finagling, they pulled out a lyric from \u201cShake it Off.\u201d It\u2019s unclear why Swift would promote a new album with an old song lyric, but it\u2019s also unclear why the sun refused to come up this morning in New York and it has been raining all day with no reprieve.\n\nAnother fan claimed to have found a message reading \u201cI\u2019ve got a blank space\u201d in the same source code.\n\nThe Verge was unable to find either of these things, but I think we can all agree that it is better to be exhilarated for a fraction of a second and disappointed for the rest of your life than it is to feel nothing.\n\nFinally, Reddit user sigsigsignify suggested an even more obtuse message from Swift:\n\n\u201cI think this is by design. She deleted every tweet she sent/retweeted after September 27th, 2015. I think she\u2019s hinting at September 27th the release date, 20:15 the drop time.\u201d\n\nAnything is possible.\n\nTheory 3: She\u2019s performing with Katy Perry at the VMAs\n\nThe popular Twitter account Pop Crave tweeted, then deleted, a screenshot appearing to show that Swift\u2019s Twitter account was suddenly following Katy Perry\u2019s. Even with the tweet taken down, fans interpreted that as an end to the years-long tabloid-mediated beef between them. Two years ago, Swift settled a controversial spat with Nicki Minaj with a surprise collaborative performance at MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards. The weirdest music awards show of the year, and the tackiest, loudest live event of August, the VMAs are coming up again this Sunday, with Katy Perry set to host.\n\nIt\u2019d be an old trick, but who says drama has to be new and innovative every time? I think we can all agree that it is better to watch the \u201cI\u2019ll Take a Pinot Grigio\u201d episode of Vanderpump Rules 100 times than it is to watch it only one time.\n\nIt would be a classic Swift move to try to upstage the new episode of Game of Thrones. But then again, would it be more of a classic Swift move to wait another day and time whatever she may or may not be planning to coincide with Monday\u2019s solar eclipse? That\u2019s one theory we don\u2019t need to go into, because I made it up right now based on no evidence.\n\nTheory 4: Taylor Swift is done with us\n\nFrom Reddit user Sansabarnaby94:\n\n\u201cwhat makes you think this means a new album?? maybe she just wants to quit forever??\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s hope not. This wasn\u2019t the first boring Friday afternoon in history and it won\u2019t be the last. We need the antics of celebrities and the thrill of harmless conspiracy theory to keep our blood pumping.\n\nSo here\u2019s a heartfelt thank you to the quiet queen of pop for stirring the pot and blessing us with a few hours of distraction. I don\u2019t know if you did this on purpose but based on all historical evidence I am going to guess... yes.", "images":
