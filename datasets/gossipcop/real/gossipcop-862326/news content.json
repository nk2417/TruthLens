She was asked, \u201cIf you have nine pizzas and then cut each pizza into eight slices, how many slices do you have?\u201d Poehler confidently said, \u201c73 slices,\u201d before immediately doubting her answer.\n\n\u201cNo. No!\u201d she said. Anaya whispered the correct answer of 72 to Poehler, who then said, \u201cThat\u2019s what I meant [by] 73 \u2014 after I buy an extra slice.\u201d\n\nFallon similarly struggled with his question, in which he had to determine the preposition in a sentence.
