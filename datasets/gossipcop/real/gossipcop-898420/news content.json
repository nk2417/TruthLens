While talking to her, McKinnon said she realized she and Aidy Bryant were \u201cMidwestern toads\u201d next to the \u201cMediterranean goddess\u201d that is Gadot.\n\n\u201cEverything she says is a prophecy,\u201d McKinnon said. \u201cEverything she said was magic.\u201d\n\nShe then revealed that the cast went to their weekly dinner with Gadot (every Tuesday, the \u201cSNL\u201d cast hits a restaurant with that week\u2019s host) and Gadot asked everyone to tell her something they have never told anyone before.\n\n\u201cNo really, we have to do this,\u201d Gadot said, according to McKinnon. Even Lorne Michaels, the creator and producer of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d weighed in.\n\nWatch the video above.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?resize=150%2C150&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/5x4_082025_COVER_B.png?fit=240%2C300&quality=80&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/KateMcKinnonGal.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Joy-Behar-and-Jake-Tapper.jpeg?fit=300%2C169&quality=89&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven.png?fit=53%2C58&quality=80&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/KateMcKinnonGal.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven", "Film Editor", "Twitter", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author Box-Sizing Border-Box Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Byline Font-Size Margin-Bottom Margin-Top Width", ".Wp-Block-Post-Author__Avatar Margin-Right .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Bio Font-Size Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Content Flex-Basis Flex-Grow .Wp-Block-Post-Author__Name Margin", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Align-Items Center Display Flex Flex-Wrap Wrap Gap .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry Margin-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Excerpt Flex-Basis", ".Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios Border-Top Solid", "Margin-Block Padding-Top .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Display Var --Display-No-Mobile", "Block", "Margin-Bottom .Wp-Block-The-Wrap-Author-Bios__Entry-Avatar Img Border Solid"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/kate-mckinnon-nails-her-gal-gadot-impression-video/", "title": "Kate McKinnon Nails Her Gal Gadot Impression (Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kate McKinnon Nails Her Gal Gadot Impression (Video)", "description": "\"Everything she says is a prophecy\"", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/kate-mckinnon-nails-her-gal-gadot-impression-video/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/KateMcKinnonGal.jpg?fit=618%2C412&quality=89&ssl=1", "width": 618, "height": 412, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/thewrap/", "published_time": "2017-12-06T15:44:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-06T16:07:07+00:00"}, "author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@thewrap", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.8", "article-tags": "gal-gadot, jimmy-fallon, kate_mckinnon, snl", "article-section": "videos", "article-categories": "news, videos", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/the_wrap_symbol_black_bkg.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=80&ssl=1"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512575064.0, "source": "https://www.thewrap.com", "summary": ""}
