At one point of the nuptial ceremony, Middleton placed her hand on her husband\u2019s thigh, at which point the duke then rested his hand on top of hers \u2013 as seen in the post below by the fan account Kate Middleton Style.\n\nOwen Humphreys/WPA Pool/Getty Images The couple were all smiles in St. George\u2019s Chapel.\n\nOn Twitter, people could not get enough of the sweet gesture.\n\nvery ,very in love and so beautiful they are perfect Lovely couple \u2014 Isabel C.Martins (@cadimamartins) October 12, 2018\n\nIn love i love this couple???????????????? \u2014 Isabel C.Martins (@cadimamartins) October 12, 2018\n\nSweeeeetttttt!!! \u2014 Uranta Bridget (@UrantaBridget) October 12, 2018\n\nHow sweet! During Princess Eugenie\u2019s royal wedding, Prince William and Kate Middleton engaged in some royal PDA as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were caught holding hands during the ceremony!https://t.co/4pgkCBALqH \u2014 Luca Forzin (@Luca_Forzin) October 12, 2018\n\nAs royal etiquette expert Myka Meier previously told INSIDER, there\u2019s no official protocol that forbids royal couples from holding hands or showing affection in public. According to Meier, the founder of Beaumont Etiquette, it all comes down to each couple\u2019s \u201cpersonal preference.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s entirely up to each couple to do what they feel most comfortable,\u201d Meier said.\n\nHowever, since Queen Elizabeth II is rarely affectionate with Prince Philip in public, the monarch seems to have set \u201can unwritten precedent\u201d that discourages PDA \u2013 especially during official royal engagements, as body language expert Robin Kermode previously told the Daily Mail.\n\n\u201cIt is rare to see royal couples holding hands on official outings,\u201d Meier told People. \u201cA more serious engagement would warrant a more serious level of professionalism, which each royal is sure to follow.\u201d\n\nThat may be one reason why Prince William and Kate Middleton are rarely seen holding hands or engaging in PDA.\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images The duchess and duke often stand in this stoic pose.\n\nNot to mention, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who married in 2011, have been working royals for a while.\n\nAs INSIDER\u2019s Kristin Salaky previously noted, William is second in line for the throne, behind only his father, Prince Charles. As such, the duke may be held to stricter standards in his role as a royal.\n\nIn comparison, Prince Harry \u2013 who is sixth in line for the throne and therefore much less likely to become the British monarch in his lifetime \u2013 frequently holds hands with his wife, Meghan Markle, in public.\n\nRead more: Why Prince William and Kate Middleton never hold hands but Prince Harry and Meghan Markle do\n\nSince the two married in May, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have made headlines time and time again for their sweet public displays of affection.\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images Meghan Markle and Prince Harry held hands during an official visit to the Joff Youth Center on October 3.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s just as likely that Prince William and Middleton simply prefer not to hold hands in public or to save such displays of affection for special occasions.\n\nVisit INSIDER\u2019s homepage for more.\n\nNOW WATCH: Briefing videos\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
