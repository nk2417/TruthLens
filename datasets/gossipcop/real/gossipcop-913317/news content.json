However, they have not announced their forthcoming baby's sex as of yet.\n\nA few of the couple's close friends also shared some choice photos from the fun, classy baby shower.\n\nThe expectant parents, who tied the knot last June, announced that they were expecting their second child in August. Two months later, ET caught up with the famed swimmer, who said that they might not stop at just two.\n\n\"We always talked about three, so the second one is on the way. We\u2019ll see what happens,\" he said. \"We\u2019re going man-to-man now, and it\u2019s probably going to be more challenging. Boomer is at the point now where he\u2019s running all over the place.\"\n\nCheck out the video below to hear more from the beloved athlete on his family's plans to expand in the future.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2019-12/celebkids_eod.png?h=dc0df84a&width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2016-08/1280_michael_phelps_nicole_johnson_omega.jpeg?width=256&quality=75", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/michael_phelps_nicole_johnson_gettyimages-813491460.jpg?h=72e0457b", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/michael_phelps_nicole_johnson_gettyimages-813491460.jpg?h=72e0457b&width=1024&quality=80", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/120x120/public/images/2017-07/1280_michael_phelps_boomer_instagram.jpg?width=256&quality=75", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27120%27%20height=%27120%27/%3e", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2016-08/1280_michael_phelps_boomer_587855302.jpg?width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%271280%27%20height=%27720%27/%3e", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/michael_phelps_nicole_johnson_gettyimages-813491460.jpg?h=72e0457b", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/michael-phelps-and-wife-nicole-throw-shower-for-babyshark-no-2-96285", "title": "Michael Phelps and Wife Nicole Throw Shower for '#BabyShark' No. 2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/michael_phelps_nicole_johnson_gettyimages-813491460.jpg?h=72e0457b", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The expectant parents were all smiles in some super cute snapshots from the fun celebration.", "title": "Michael Phelps and Wife Nicole Throw Shower for '#BabyShark' No. 2", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/michael-phelps-and-wife-nicole-throw-shower-for-babyshark-no-2-96285", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The expectant parents were all smiles in some super cute snapshots from the fun celebration.", "twitter": {"description": "The expectant parents were all smiles in some super cute snapshots from the fun celebration.", "title": "Michael Phelps and Wife Nicole Throw Shower for '#BabyShark' No. 2", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/michael-phelps-and-wife-nicole-throw-shower-for-babyshark-no-2-96285", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2018-02/michael_phelps_nicole_johnson_gettyimages-813491460.jpg?h=72e0457b", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "Michael Phelps and Wife Nicole Throw Shower for '#BabyShark' No. 2 | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, , Michael Phelps, Babies & Kids", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
