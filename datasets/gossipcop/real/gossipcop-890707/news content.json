Fast forward a few years and boom, Meghan Markle.\n\nMeanwhile, Bowes's great-grandson Sir George Bowes became a member of parliament during the reign of Charles II and to cut a very long story short, Prince Harry came along.\n\nWhat's more bizarre is the fact that Prince Harry's ancestor, Henry VIII, reportedly executed a relative of Markle.\n\nA new report, via The Sunday Telegraph, claims that back when Henry VIII was reigning in Britain, there was a plot orchestrated by a man named Lord Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford and the great-great-great grandfather to Christopher Hussey (see above), to attempt to overthrow the monarch. As a result, Henry VIII had him beheaded.\n\nNow, before everyone stars yelling 'incest' at Harry and Meghan's shared lineage, we'd like to point out that if you go far back enough to the Middle Ages, you're probably related to the man sitting next to you on the bus or your colleague sat opposite to you.\n\nA genetic survey in 2013 found that all Europeans living today are related to the same set of ancestors who lived 1,000 years ago. And you don't have to go back much further in time to to find that everyone in the world is related to each other.\n\nWho would've though it, ey?\n\nThe news comes days after Channel 4's aired a documentary looking into the Californian star's life, titled When Harry Met Meghan: A Royal Romance.\n\nRelated Story The Weeknd Unfollows Selena Gomez\\'s Friends\n\nRelated Story Things We Learned
