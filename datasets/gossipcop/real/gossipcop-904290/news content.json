One of the most memorable instances occurred when Sacheen Littlefeather rejected Marlon Brando\u2019s Academy Award for best actor in 1973 with a speech advocating for Native American rights. However, this is one of the first times the effort has been coordinated among many attendees.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/emma-stone-billie-jean.jpg?w=1000&h=667&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/saru-jayaraman-amy-poehler.jpg?w=1024", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/emma-stone-billie-jean.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ss.jpg?w=1024", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/triptico_1515348766008.jpg?w=1024", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tarana-burke-and-michelle-williams.jpg"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/emma-stone-billie-jean.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Nyren", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/celebrities-bring-activists-golden-globes-emma-watson-meryl-streep-laura-dern-1202655789/", "title": "Emma Stone, Meryl Streep, Laura Dern to Be Accompanied by Activists at Golden Globes", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Emma Stone, Meryl Streep, Susan Sarandon and more are bringing activists to the Golden Globes as their guests.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Erin Nyren", "tags": "Emma Stone, Golden Globes, Laura Dern, Meryl Streep, Michelle Williams, Susan Sarandon", "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Emma Stone, Meryl Streep, Laura Dern to Be Accompanied by Activists at Golden Globes", "url": "https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/celebrities-bring-activists-golden-globes-emma-watson-meryl-streep-laura-dern-1202655789/", "description": "Emma Stone, Meryl Streep, Susan Sarandon and more are bringing activists to the Golden Globes as their guests.", "site_name": "Variety", "image": {"identifier": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/emma-stone-billie-jean.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "width": 1000, "height": 563, "alt": "Emma Stone and Billie Jean King'Battle of the Sexes' premiere, BFI London Film Festival, UK - 07 Oct 2017"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-07T18:01:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-08T00:42:13+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Emma Stone, Meryl Streep, Susan Sarandon and more are bringing activists to the Golden Globes as their guests.", "site": "@variety", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/ecnyren", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Emma Stone, Meryl Streep, Laura Dern to Be Accompanied by Activists at Golden Globes", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/emma-stone-billie-jean.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515348098.0, "source": "https://variety.com", "summary": ""}
