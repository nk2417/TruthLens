But now, Finnish actor Joonas Suotamo has stepped into the Star Wars galaxy to wear the iconic costume.\n\nSuotamo, who stands at 7ft tall, has stood in as a body double to Mayhew in both Star Wars: The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi. He will officially take over the role in the upcoming standalone Star Wars film, Solo: A Star Wars Story.\n\n\u201cWhenever Chewie is active, that was me,\u201d Suotamo says in PEOPLE\u2019s special issue Star Wars: The Ultimate Guide to the Last Jedi. \u201cThe first scene I shot was Han and Chewie walking into the Millennium Falcon in Episode VII.\u201d\n\nSo who is the new Chewbacca? Here are 5 things to know about Suotamo.\n\nEthan Miller/Getty\n\n1. He used to play basketball.\n\nSuotamo took advantage of his unusually tall stature and played power forward for the Penn State basketball team until he graduated in 2009.\n\nIn fact, his days as an athlete are what helped get discovered for the part.\n\n\u201cThe Basketball Association of Finland called me because they had been approached by casting from London. They were prepping to do the film, and they were finding it hard to find this seven-footer with blue eyes,\u201d he says. \u201cSo they called every Scandinavian basketball association. Because I\u2019d played in the youth national teams in my younger days, they were able to point me out to these people. I went to London for an audition, and that\u2019s where it all started.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BLlT0zPgyF2/\n\n2. He still can\u2019t believe he\u2019s in Star Wars.\n\nDespite his recent rise to fame, the actor says he\u2019s still struggling to accept that he\u2019s part of one of the most iconic movie franchises.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t believe in it until they called me and said I had the part,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes I still wake up thinking, \u2018Where am I? What is this dream?\u2019 I\u2019m doing Star Wars films, I still don\u2019t quite believe it. Normal life is very much the same for me as it was.\u201d\n\nSuotamo says he went back and binge-watched all the original films in order to master Chewbacca\u2019s mannerisms.\n\n\u201cIt was great just because he\u2019s unique and the way he walks and the way he goes about doing things, that it was very difficult to learn,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I\u2019m still learning.\u201d\n\n3. He passed out after shooting his first scene as Chewbacca.\n\n\u201cYou have to stay still for so long and if you forget to inhale deeply when they [put on the chest piece], you\u2019re left with this little too few inches to breathe,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was really intense.\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard also Darth Vader, Dave Prowse, fainted when he was done, so I don\u2019t have to feel too bad.\u201d\n\n4. He wants to make his own movies.\n\nSuotamo graduated Penn State with a film degree.\n\n\u201cI still want to start making my own films,\u201d he says. \u201cI started a video production company and made corporate videos, edited them and collected gear. Then all of a sudden I was cast as Chewie, which was pretty great. I was watching JJ Abrams work, and learning about different things that go on to making these big Hollywood movies, so it\u2019s been pretty awesome.\u201d\n\n5. He\u2019s getting attention online for his good looks.\n\nAfter Suotamo walked the red carpet at the Last Jedi premiere, the internet has become obsessed with the new Chewbacca.\n\nBut don\u2019t get your hopes up \u2014 Suotamo is engaged and is expecting his first child with his fiancee in February.\n\nThe couple even had a Star Wars themed pregnancy announcement.\n\n\u201cGuess what? We are glad to announce that the owner of this porg will arrive in February 2018.\u201d\n\nCatch Suotamo in action in Star Wars: The Last Jedi on Dec. 15.", "images":
