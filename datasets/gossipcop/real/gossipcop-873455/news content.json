But according to Kylie Jenner, rocking turquoise, purple, pink, and neon yellow wigs is surprisingly more tiring than we thought.\n\nIn Sunday\u2019s episode of Life of Kylie, Jenner shares that she\u2019s ready to break away from the wig-mania while planning her 2017 Coachella look. \"Honestly, like, guys I don't want to disappoint anybody, but I just want my hair long and black and pretty,\" Jenner tells makeup artist Ariel Tejada, her assistant Victoria Gamero, and her right hand gal Jordyn Woods.\n\nRelated\n\nWoods also agreed with Jenner, stating that a classic look would come as a surprise to fans who will most likely be expecting a bright-colored wig for this event. \"I don't want to be a weirdo.

Instead, Jenner jokingly lists, \u201ccool earrings, makeup, and my t-ts out,\u201d as her new focus.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re an avid follower of Jenner, then you know that she ended up deciding on a short purple wig and neon yellow wig for Coachella.\n\nCheck out the post on Instagram\n\nCheck out the post on Instagram\n\nHowever, since then we have been seeing way more of Kylie\u2019s natural black hair.\n\nCheck out the post on Instagram\n\nCheck out the post on Instagram\n\nCould her infamous wigs be gone for good?
