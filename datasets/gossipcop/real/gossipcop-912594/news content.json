To not sabotage something before I\u2019ve had a chance to do it because I assume I\u2019ll be rejected,\u201d she said.\n\nUnion, who has been open about her struggles with infertility and the emotional journey that comes with it, said that having a baby is definitely on that vision board: \u201cThe only things that have not come to pass are a cosmetics line, Machu Picchu, and a baby\u2026 I\u2019ll put those things back on this year\u2019s board and see what happens.\u201d\n\nAlso on the board? \u201cFlawless by Gabrielle Union,\u201d the hair care line that she launched last year for women with textured hair. Union will also be launching the second season of her clothing line this month.\n\nShe did not mention if heading back to Miami was on her vision board, but she and her husband Dwyane Wade are saying hello again to the sunshine state now that he has been traded from the Cleveland Cavaliers to the Miami Heat. Union tweeted her excitement about the move.\n\n????????? 305 HOME!!!! Let\u2019s goooooooo HEAT!!!! Can\u2019t. Wait. \u2014 Gabrielle Union (@itsgabrielleu) February 8, 2018\n\nLooks like Union just got another big item to add to her happy list.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=28052837&cv=4.4.0&cj=1", "https://thegrio.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=634,height=888,fit=crop,quality=90,gravity=auto,sharpen=1,metadata=none,format=auto,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Gabby.jpg", "https://thegrio.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=1024,height=590,fit=crop,quality=90,gravity=auto,sharpen=1,metadata=none,format=auto,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-843500880-e1518189216720.jpg", "https://thegrio.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=90,gravity=auto,sharpen=1,metadata=none,format=auto,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/theGrio-BlackMade-Footer-Promo-Mobile.png", "https://thegrio.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=70,height=104,fit=crop,quality=90,gravity=auto,sharpen=1,metadata=none,format=auto,onerror=redirect/wp-content/themes/thegrio-child-theme/img/theGrio_G_Logo.svg", "https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-843500880-e1518189216720.jpg", "https://thegrio.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=595,height=327,fit=crop,quality=90,gravity=auto,sharpen=1,metadata=none,format=auto,onerror=redirect/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Large_Logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-843500880-e1518189216720.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thegrio Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://thegrio.com/2018/02/09/gabrielle-union-overcame-worthlessness/", "title": "Gabrielle Union on how she uses therapy and a vision board to overcome feelings of worthlessness", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "pubexchange": {"image": "https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-843500880-e1518189216720-428x320.jpg"}, "description": "Gabrielle Union is on the\u00a0March 2018 issue of\u00a0Redbook\u00a0magazine, and in the accompanying interview, she opened up about her struggle with self-worth.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Gabrielle Union on how she uses therapy and a vision board to overcome feelings of worthlessness", "description": "Gabrielle Union is on the\u00a0March 2018 issue of\u00a0Redbook\u00a0magazine, and in the accompanying interview, she opened up about her struggle with self-worth.", "url": "https://thegrio.com/2018/02/09/gabrielle-union-overcame-worthlessness/", "site_name": "TheGrio", "image": {"identifier": "https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-843500880-e1518189216720.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 765, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theGrio/", "published_time": "2018-02-09T15:22:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-09-28T05:41:30+00:00", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "author": "TheGrio Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@theGrio", "site": "@theGrio", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "TheGrio Staff", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Big-G-transparent-BG-300x300.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518152400.0, "source": "https://thegrio.com", "summary": ""}
