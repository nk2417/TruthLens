It is a sequel to the 2012 film Pitch Perfect. The film centers on the fictional Barden University Bellas, an all-female a cappella singing group, who try to beat out a competing German musical group in a world singing championship. The film features Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Skylar Astin, Adam DeVine, Anna Camp, Ben Platt, Hana Mae Lee, Alexis Knapp, Ester Dean, Kelly Jakle, Shelley Regner, John Michael Higgins, and Banks all reprising their roles from the previous film, now joined by Hailee Steinfeld, Katey Sagal, Birgitte Hjort S\u00f8rensen, and Flula Borg.\n\nThe film was released in the United States on May 15, 2015, by Universal Pictures. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed $287.5 million worldwide. It surpassed the total gross of the original film ($115.4 million) in five days, and also became the highest-grossing musical comedy film of all time, overtaking School of Rock ($131.3 million).[5] A sequel, Pitch Perfect 3, was released on December 22, 2017.[6][7]\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nIn 2015, The Barden Bellas have been the ICCA National champions for three consecutive years and are now led by senior Beca Mitchell and three-time super senior Chloe Beale.\n\nA national scandal (dubbed \"Muffgate\") erupts when Patricia \"Fat Amy\" Hobart accidentally rips her pants in front of U.S. President Barack Obama during his birthday performance at the Kennedy Center, exposing her genitalia and leading to the Bellas' suspension from the ICCAs.\n\nBeca makes a deal that they can be reinstated should they win the A Cappella World Championship. Freshman Emily Junk hopes to follow in the footsteps of her mother, Katherine, by becoming a Bella. She watches an a cappella performance by the Treblemakers, now led by Beca's boyfriend Jesse Swanson. Jesse's friend Benjamin \"Benji\" Applebaum, develops a crush on Emily.\n\nThe Bellas learn that German powerhouse group Das Sound Machine (DSM) has replaced them on their victory tour and is favorite to win the Worlds. Beca has secretly started an internship at recording studio Residual Heat, which only Jesse knows (and Fat Amy later discovers).\n\nAs the Bellas' suspension means they cannot hold auditions, Emily goes directly to their sorority house and sings her unfinished song \"Flashlight\". They decide she can join; since she came of her own accord, they technically aren't breaking any rules.\n\nThe Bellas meet DSM when the latter performs at a car show. DSM leaders Pieter Kr\u00e4mer and Kommissar mock the Bellas. Both groups are invited to a riff-off with the Treblemakers, the Tone Hangers (composed of former Treblemakers, including previous leader Bumper Allen, with whom Amy is in a casual relationship), and the Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe Bellas make it to the final two, but lose to DSM when Emily sings \"Flashlight\", violating the rule of no original songs. Bumper asks Amy on a traditional date and to officially be his girlfriend; she refuses. At a practice performance for the Worlds, the Bellas' set ends in disaster when their pyrotechnics set fire to Cynthia Rose's hair.\n\nChloe takes The Bellas on a retreat to rediscover their roots and synchronicity, led by former Bella Aubrey Posen. Beca's internship is revealed, and Beca argues with Chloe over her obsession with the group and accuses the other Bellas of not thinking about their futures. She storms off, only to step into one of the camp's bear traps.\n\nBeca apologizes before being saved by Lilly. The Bellas accept that they will go their separate ways after graduation, and regain harmony by singing \"Cups\", Beca's audition song for the group.\n\nAmy regrets ending things with Bumper and they reconcile. Beca's boss has been unimpressed with her, so Beca offers to help Emily produce \"Flashlight\". He likes the result and says he looks forward to working with them.\n\nThe senior Bellas graduate and the group heads to Copenhagen for the World Finals. Emily and Benji share a kiss. The Bellas deliver a stripped-down performance ending in a harmonized version of \"Flashlight\" with Aubrey, Katherine, and other past Bellas joining in. They win. As the senior Bellas leave Barden, they give Emily a belated initiation ceremony, with Amy demonstrating the last tradition: christening the house by sliding down the staircase.\n\nAs the credits roll, Bumper appears on The Voice and all of the judges turn around. He picks Christina Aguilera to be his coach.\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nAdditionally, Keegan-Michael Key appears as Sammy, Beca's boss at Residual Heat, a rude but successful producer, Shawn Carter Peterson appears as Dax, an intern at Residual Heat, David Cross (credited as Sir Willups Brightlysmore) appears as the Riff-Off host, Pentatonix members Scott Hoying, Kirstin Maldonado, Mitch Grassi, Avi Kaplan, and Kevin Olusola appear as Team Canada, Penn Masala appears as Team India, the Naan Stops, and Filharmonic appears as Team Philippines.\n\nGreen Bay Packers players Clay Matthews, David Bakhtiari, Don Barclay, Josh Sitton, and T.

And it's not funny enough.\"[53] David Edelstein of New York Magazine gave a negative review and, despite having reviewed the first film positively, described the sequel as \"A Ca-Terrible\".[54] Edelstein was critical of the script, noting \"there are good ideas that needed another pass\", and of Kendrick's performance, saying \"I've never seen her so flat-out bad \u2014 distracted, depressed, conviction-less\"; however, he conceded that the climactic number was excellent.[54]\n\nRodrigo Perez at IndieWire wrote \"The movie's off-color humor also doesn't connect like it once did either. The casual racism, homophobia and sexism might be tolerable if any of it was remotely funny, but none of it is.\"[55] Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast liked the film but was critical of the \"tone-deaf racial jokes\", particularly the casual racism in the subplot about Flo, a senior Bella singer from Guatemala. He also did not find the racially charged jokes from the commentators funny.[56][57][58]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nSequel [ edit ]\n\nOn April 11, 2015, a month before the release of Pitch Perfect 2, it was announced that Rebel Wilson would return for a third film, although she stated that she did not know if Anna Kendrick or any of the other cast members would also be reprising their roles. She added that she would be \"up for a Fat Amy spin-off,\" although nothing had yet been confirmed.[65] Director, star, and producer Elizabeth Banks acknowledged the possibility of a third film, saying, \"I will say, it would be disingenuous to say that no one's talking about a Pitch Perfect 3; the possibility of it. We are really focused on getting as many butts in seats for this one. If fans embrace it, we are going to seriously think about what the continuing journey would look like, but we don't know what that is yet\".[66]\n\nOn June 10, 2015, a third film was officially confirmed, with Kay Cannon returning to write the script.[67] Several days later it was announced both Kendrick and Wilson would reprise their roles, and later Brittany Snow was also confirmed to return.[6] Banks returned to produce, but in June 2016 it was announced she would not be directing the film.[68]\n\nThe film was originally slated for a July 21, 2017 release, and was later pushed back to August 4, 2017, before moving back to the July 21 slot.[7] In May 2016, it was moved again, this time being pushed back to December 22, 2017.[69]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/20px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/icons/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?useformat=desktop&type=1x1&usesul3=1", "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/resources/assets/mediawiki_compact.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/Pitch_Perfect_2_poster.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-tagline-en.svg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/mobile/copyright/wikipedia-wordmark-en.svg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/40px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/Pitch_Perfect_2_poster.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_Perfect_2", "title": "Pitch Perfect 2", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.46.0-wmf.2", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "robots": "max-image-preview:standard", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/Pitch_Perfect_2_poster.jpg", "width": 758, "height": 1200}, "title": "Pitch Perfect 2 - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1120"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
