ABC announced it was canceling \u201cRoseanne\u201d in the aftermath of the Twitter outburst.\n\nJarrett said on MSNBC she is \u201cfine\u201d but feels concerned for people without \u201cfriends and followers who come right to their defense\u201d who experience \u201cordinary examples of racism that happen every single day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we have to turn it into a teaching moment,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m worried about all the people out there who don\u2019t have a circle of friends and followers who come right to their defense. The person who is walking down the street minding their own business and they see somebody cling to their purse, or run across the street, or every black parent I know who has a boy who has to sit down and have a conversation \u2013 the talk \u2013 as we call it. As you say, those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day.\u201d\n\nBarr, who has since apologized to Jarrett on Twitter, is facing intense backlash for her comments.\n\nIn a statement announcing the cancellation of her sitcom, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said, \u201cRoseanne\u2019s Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180529140547-roseanne-barr-getty-images.jpg?q=x_74,y_34,h_952,w_1692,c_crop/w_250",
