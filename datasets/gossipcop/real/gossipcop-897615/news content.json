Just about one out of every three commercials is going to say something that's going to hurt somebody's feelings.\"\n\nShe added: \u201cIf you see something that you don't like or offended by on television or any other place, write letters and send them to the right people and you can really make a difference, not just for yourself but for lots of other people.\"\n\nMeghan, a former UN ambassador for women\u2019s rights, looked back at the saga in a speech at the United Nations in 2015 nearly 22 years after seeing the advert. \"It just wasn't right and something needed to be done,\" she said.\n\n\"At the age of 11, I created my small level of impact by standing up for equality.\u201d\n\nShe said after she and her fellow pupils saw an advert for the dishwashing soap, she became \"shocked and angry\" by how they depicted gender roles, and also upset with two male classmates who quipped women \"belong\" in the kitchen.\n\nAfter Meghan went home and told her parents, her father urged her to stand up for what she believed in and pen a letter \"to the most powerful people\".\n\nTaking his advice, she sent a letter to Procter & Gamble and high profile figures such as former First Lady Hillary Clinton, women\u2019s rights lawyer Gloria Allred and Nick News anchor Ellerbee.\n\nAfter she urged Procter & Gamble to change the language to \"people\" rather than \"women\", the company agreed to do so.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/21/12/meghan-markle-nickelodeon.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/21/12/meghan-markle-nickelodeon.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/meghan-markle-nickelodeon-sexism-video-watch-hillary-clinton-royal-wedding-a8361396.html", "title": "Eleven-year-old Meghan Markle fights sexism on Nickelodeon in resurfaced video", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "Home News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/news/uk/home-news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "description": "Footage reveals she\u00a0wrote\u00a0a letter to Procter & Gamble over the language of their advert for Ivory dish soap", "og": {"updated_time": "2018-05-21T11:39:58.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "11-year-old Meghan Markle fights sexism on Nickelodeon in resurfaced video", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/meghan-markle-nickelodeon-sexism-video-watch-hillary-clinton-royal-wedding-a8361396.html", "type": "article", "description": "Footage reveals she\u00a0wrote\u00a0a letter to Procter & Gamble over the language of their advert for Ivory dish soap", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/21/12/meghan-markle-nickelodeon.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/21/12/meghan-markle-nickelodeon.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-21T11:39:58.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-05-21T11:39:58.000Z", "section": "News", "subsection": "UK", "author_name": "Maya Oppenheim", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 446, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 2, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 1, "external_link_count": 0}, "date": "2018-05-21T11:39:58.000Z", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#919191", "indy-test-internal-article-helmet": "indy", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000177327066"}, "twitter": {"title": "11-year-old Meghan Markle fights sexism on Nickelodeon in resurfaced video", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Footage reveals she\u00a0wrote\u00a0a letter to Procter & Gamble over the language of their advert for Ivory dish soap", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/21/12/meghan-markle-nickelodeon.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800"}, "keywords": "[\"Meghan Markle\",\"Internal\"]"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526902798.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
