Nashville, meanwhile, will return with new episodes at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Thursday, June 1.\n\nAdditional artists, presenters and special guests will be announced soon.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows that CMT has a special connection with country music and the incredible fans that love it so much,\u201d Esten said. \u201cThat connection is why our show, Nashville, now has a perfect home on the network. It\u2019s also why there is no other show quite like the CMT Music Awards. It\u2019s a show fully dedicated to the fans and an annual chance for them to place their votes for their favorite artists. Besides always being flat-out fun, it\u2019s also always been a stage for magical musical moments \u2014 and a place where some of country\u2019s biggest legends have been made.\u201d\n\nNominations will be announced Tuesday, May 9. Fan voting begins the same day at CMT.com and continues until Monday, June 5, at 12:01 a.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nashville_s03e16_charles_esten_still.jpg?w=2000&h=1126&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nashville_s03e16_charles_esten_still.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nashville_s03e16_charles_esten_still.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kimberly Nordyke", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/music/music-news/cmt-music-awards-nashvilles-charles-esten-host-blake-shelton-performers-998849/", "title": "CMT Music Awards: \u2018Nashville\u2019s\u2019 Charles Esten to Host; Blake Shelton Among Performers", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Brett Eldredge, Luke Bryan, Miranda Lambert and Thomas Rhett also are set to perform at the June 7 ceremony.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Kimberly Nordyke", "tags": "CMT Music Awards", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "CMT Music Awards: \u2018Nashville\u2019s\u2019 Charles Esten to Host; Blake Shelton Among Performers", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/music/music-news/cmt-music-awards-nashvilles-charles-esten-host-blake-shelton-performers-998849/", "description": "Brett Eldredge, Luke Bryan, Miranda Lambert and Thomas Rhett also are set to perform at the June 7 ceremony.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nashville_s03e16_charles_esten_still.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "CMT Music Awards: 'Nashville's' Charles Esten Host; Blake Shelton Among Performers"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-01T07:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-05-01T07:37:40+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "Brett Eldredge, Luke Bryan, Miranda Lambert and Thomas Rhett also are set to perform at the June 7 ceremony.", "site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "CMT Music Awards: \u2018Nashville\u2019s\u2019 Charles Esten to Host; Blake Shelton Among Performers", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/nashville_s03e16_charles_esten_still.jpg?w=1440&h=810&crop=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493622000.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
