Paul Rudd\u2018s bite-sized superhero becomes the latest Avenger-adjacent hero to get the sequel treatment in the film, which upgrades Evangeline Lilly\u2018s character from civilian to sidekick. Watch the trailer below.\n\nSet between \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d and the just-released \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d (so much war!), the film follows Scott Lang/Ant-Man as he deals with being placed under house arrest in further proof that no good deed goes unpunished. Michael Douglas, Bobby Cannavale, Judy Greer, and Michael Pe\u00f1a will all be reprising their roles.\n\nThey\u2019ll be joined by Michelle Pfeiffer, Laurence Fishburne, Hannah John-Kamen. Peyton Reed will be returning to the director\u2019s chair for \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp,\u201d which Disney will release on July 6.", "images": ["https://www.sportico.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SPORTICAST__SP_Red_No_Logo_Horiz-002-5.png?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-05-01-at-10-04-09-am.png?w=650", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7155.jpg?w=3000&h=2656&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/TNB_05859_R-H-2024-1.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/NBAXbeIN_en.png?resize=232,175", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7417.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-MIssion1-1.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/anaconda.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/john-and-yoko.jpg?w=770&h=980&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-05-01-at-10-04-09-am.png?w=1732&h=1060&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/thoughts-and-prayers-hbo.jpeg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2232520631.jpg?resize=232,175", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Apple_TV_Your_Friends_and_Neighbors_key_art_graphic_header_16_9_show_home.jpg.large_2x.jpg?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2246549744.jpg?w=3000&h=3000&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-01-at-8.32.46\u202fPM.png?w=300&h=300&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/RP_B7173.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-Lowdown-Ethan-Hawke-interview.jpg?w=1200&h=800&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-05-01-at-10-04-09-am.png?w=650", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Nordine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/ant-man-and-the-wasp-trailer-paul-rudd-evangeline-lilly-1201958895/", "title": "\u2018Ant-Man and the Wasp\u2019 Trailer: Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly Team Up to Show the Power of Superhero Bugs", "meta_data": {"description": "It's set before \"Avengers: Infinity War.\"", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400654071", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Michael Nordine", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Ant-Man and the Wasp\u2019 Trailer: Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly Team Up to Show the Power of Superhero Bugs", "url": "https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/ant-man-and-the-wasp-trailer-paul-rudd-evangeline-lilly-1201958895/", "description": "It's set before \"Avengers: Infinity War.\"", "site_name": "IndieWire", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-05-01-at-10-04-09-am.png?w=650", "width": 650, "height": 398, "alt": "'Ant-Man and the Wasp' Trailer: Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly Team Up"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-01T14:04:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-01T14:04:35+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "It's set before \"Avengers: Infinity War.\"", "site": "@IndieWire", "creator": "@slowbeard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Ant-Man and the Wasp\u2019 Trailer: Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly Team Up to Show the Power of Superhero Bugs", "image": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-05-01-at-10-04-09-am.png?w=650"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-iw_favicon.png?w=270", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/UUkn-enk2RU"], "publish_date": 1525183475.0, "source": "https://www.indiewire.com", "summary": ""}
