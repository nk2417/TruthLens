The Olympic athlete delivered two flawless performances for a combined score of 80 out of 80, and then was shockingly eliminated.\n\n\n\nDespite the unexpected outcome, the 20-year-old gymnast isn't letting the elimination get to her. Biles and her partner, Sasha Farber, stopped to talk to ET's Cameron Mathison after the show, where they opened up about how they were looking on the bright side of the situation.\n\n\"I have been going since the Olympics non-stop and then I came into here to Dancing With the Stars and the experience was wonderful,\" Biles shared. \"I feel like I found out a lot about myself -- not just 'Gymnastics Simone' but 'Normal Simone.'\"\n\n\n\nWATCH: 'Dancing With the Stars' Season 24 Semi-Finals Delivers Most Shocking Elimination Yet!\n\n\n\nThe superstar athlete explained that getting her first perfect score of the season on Monday, and then following it up with a second perfect performance was \"a win in itself, whether America [voted] for it or not.\"\n\nBiles also said that, after winning four gold medals at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, she could use some time out of the spotlight, and might enjoy a bit of anonymity.\n\n\"I feel like I've been at a high so much, no one wants to see my name again on social media, I mean come on,\" Biles joked. \"Sometimes I'm sick of my own name. On the radio [I hear] 'Simone Biles' and I'm like, 'Oh my god, shut up!'\"\n\n\n\nPHOTOS: Complete List: 'Dancing with the Stars' Winners\n\n\n\nOne big reason Biles says she isn't too upset about the loss is that she's not nearly as familiar with the intricacies of dancing as she is with gymnastics, so she doesn't have the same insatiable competitive drive.\n\n\"This isn't my element. If it were gymnastics I'd be like, 'You know what Simone, you better get back into the gym.' But I don't know how to dance in heels! I was still tripping yesterday,\" she explained.\n\nNo matter the outcome of their DWTS journey, Farber had nothing but love and praise for his young partner.\n\n\"This has literally has been a dream come true to work with her,\" Farber shared. \"She's grown so much as a person and I wish she was in the finals, I wish she won this whole competition, and I wish the best for her. I'm going to be there cheering her on at the next Olympics with a huge sign saying 'Go Simone!'\"\n\n\n\nWATCH: Simone Biles Confides in \u2018DWTS\u2019 Partner Sasha Farber About Her New Dating Life\n\n\n\nWith Biles out of the competition, the season comes down to Fifth Harmony singer Normani Kordei, NFL star Rashad Jennings and former Chicago Cubs catcher David Ross.\n\nHowever, Biles said she has a feeling it's going to be Jennings and his pro partner, Emma Slater, who walk away with the coveted mirror ball trophy.\n\n\n\nKordei, Jennings and Ross will battle it out in the Dancing With the Stars two-night finale next Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.\n\n\n\nWATCH: Simone Biles Addresses Viral 'Gold Medal' Comment: 'I Don't Know What More I Can Do'\n\n", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/et_dwts_simone_051517_1280.jpg", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/640x360/public/images/2023-12/GettyImages-1825462653.jpg?h=d4a2cb2c&width=753&quality=80", "data:image/svg+xml,%3csvg%20xmlns=%27http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%27%20version=%271.1%27%20width=%27640%27%20height=%27360%27/%3e"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/et_dwts_simone_051517_1280.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/217558_simone_biles_and_sasha_farber_react_to_shocking_dwts_elimination_this_isn_t_my_element", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Simone Biles and Sasha Farber React to Shocking 'DWTS' Elimination: 'This Isn't My Element'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/et_dwts_simone_051517_1280.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "description": "The Olympic gymnast and her partner opened up to ET about getting sent home after Monday's semi-finals.", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Simone Biles and Sasha Farber React to Shocking 'DWTS' Elimination: 'This Isn't My Element'", "site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/217558_simone_biles_and_sasha_farber_react_to_shocking_dwts_elimination_this_isn_t_my_element", "type": "Article"}, "description": "The Olympic gymnast and her partner opened up to ET about getting sent home after Monday's semi-finals.", "twitter": {"description": "The Olympic gymnast and her partner opened up to ET about getting sent home after Monday's semi-finals.", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Simone Biles and Sasha Farber React to Shocking 'DWTS' Elimination: 'This Isn't My Element'", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/217558_simone_biles_and_sasha_farber_react_to_shocking_dwts_elimination_this_isn_t_my_element", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/1280x720/public/images/2017-05/et_dwts_simone_051517_1280.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "creator": "@etnow"}, "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Simone Biles and Sasha Farber React to Shocking 'DWTS' Elimination: 'This Isn't My Element' | Entertainment Tonight", "fb": {"pages": 106843036179, "admins": 3111204, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Entertainment Tonight, News, TV, Dancing With The Stars", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#fff", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
