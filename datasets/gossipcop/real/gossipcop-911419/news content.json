The reception was held at Stamos\u2019 home in Beverly Hills.\n\nMcHugh wore a white, strapless ballgown with a tulle skirt, while Stamos wore a black tux. A source tells PEOPLE, \u201cCaitlyn looked absolutely stunning in a princess dress.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey exchanged wows in front of family and close friends. It was a very touching ceremony. There were tears, but mostly smiles. John and Caitlyn looked very happy.\u201d\n\nHowever, the couple\u2019s wedding weekend didn\u2019t exactly go off as planned. The Beverly Hills Police Department confirmed to PEOPLE that McHugh\u2019s hotel room at the Beverly Hills Hotel was burglarized on Friday evening and the unknown thief made off with an estimated $165,000 worth of jewelry. Neither McHugh nor Stamos was in the room at the time and the incident remains under investigation.\n\nAfter almost two years of dating, Stamos, 54, proposed Oct. 22, 2017, at Disneyland, one of McHugh\u2019s favorite places. (McHugh is an active Disneybounder, a superfan who dresses up in character at the amusement park.)\n\n\u201cThe [pregnancy] happened. Then I said, I better have a ring on her finger because it\u2019s the right thing to do, and I wanted to marry her anyway,\u201d Stamos told PEOPLE exclusively in December. \u201cSo I called her parents to ask, and it was like, \u2018You better!'\u201d\n\nBefore popping the question, Stamos screened a short film that he made of romantic moments from animated Pixar and Disney films, ending the display with The Little Mermaid \u2014 which encouraged him to \u201cjust ask the girl.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe loves Disneyland and [at the park], I got on my knee and asked her,\u201d Stamos said. \u201cI pulled the ring out. I don\u2019t know how she did it, but she went to hug me and slipped her finger right in it. When the park closed, we ran around the park in our Disney onesies.\u201d\n\nThe pair first met while filming an episode of Law & Order: SVU in 2011, but it wasn\u2019t exactly love at first sight.\n\n\u201cI played a guy who was so egotistical that he thought he should spread his progeny, so he had like 60 kids or something. He was poking holes in condoms and stuff. And Caitlin, ironically, was one of the girls that I was trying to fool and have a baby with,\u201d Stamos explained. \u201cThat was a long time ago. She was in another relationship. And we just met back up again. Her roommate was on an episode of Fuller House, and so she was in the audience. I walked in, I went, \u2018Hey, are you stalking me?\u2019 She was like, \u2018No\u2026\u2019 That\u2019s why I love her. She\u2019s like, \u2018What? No. I haven\u2019t thought of you twice.'\u201d\n\nStamos said he has grown since his previous marriage to actress Rebecca Romijn, whom he wed in 1998 and divorced in 2005. \u201cI was young. My values weren\u2019t set properly,\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019ve kicked and screamed going into adulthood.\u201d\n\nStill, Stamos held out hope that he\u2019d get married again and start a family.\n\n\u201cI knew the right person would come along, especially, if I prayed and hoped,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know my parents are up there watching, so I think they delivered an angel to me.\u201d (Stamos\u2019 father William and mother Loretta died in 2001 and 2014, respectively.)\n\nRELATED VIDEO: John Stamos and Caitlin McHugh Are Engaged!\n\nWith the wedding now behind them, the newlyweds will gear up for their next major role \u2014 as parents. Stamos said that he and McHugh \u201ctalked about\u201d having a baby in the past, and then everything just fell into place.\n\n\u201cWe have the same morals and the same values, that all clicked nicely. So we said, \u2018Oh, well, maybe we should have a family,\u2019\u201d Stamos said.\n\nMcHugh suggested, \u201c\u2018Maybe we should have a kid [before we get married]\u2019 and I said, \u2018Why?\u2019\u201d Stamos recalled, revealing she jokingly responded, \u201cBecause you\u2019re old.\u201d\n\nJohn Stamos.\n\nThe couple are overjoyed to be adding to their family \u2014 though they\u2019re keeping mum on the baby\u2019s sex for now \u2014 with Stamos admitting that he \u201calways wanted to be a dad\u201d but wasn\u2019t sure it was in the cards until now.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be a fun dad. I\u2019ve been practicing for a long time,\u201d Stamos said, joking, \u201cI\u2019ve done every schtick you can do with a baby on TV \u2026 all the bits and jokes and diaper gags. I\u2019ll probably just do all that stuff.\u201d\n\nChris Polk/KCA2017/Getty Images\n\nMcHugh described her new husband as \u201cthe biggest, most loving and generous heart of anyone I know.\u201d\n\n\u201cI greatly admire his originality, creativity, ambition, work ethic and humor \u2014 all qualities I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll pass down to his child,\u201d McHugh said. \u201cHe\u2019s always been wonderful with kids, and I\u2019m sure he will be an amazing father.\u201d", "images":
