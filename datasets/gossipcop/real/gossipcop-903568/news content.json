Paul and his friends filmed their experience in the forest, which included finding a man who had committed suicide, and put it all on tape. Paul was hit hard with an abundance of criticism from fans, celebrities and fellow YouTubers, who deemed the video to be offensive and disrespectful.\n\nPaul initially issued a written apology on his Twitter, followed by a video on his YouTube page with a further statement. \u201cI should have never posted the video,\u201d he said, adding \u201cthere are a lot of things I should have done differently, but I didn\u2019t and for that, from the bottom of my heart, I am sorry.\u201d\n\nPaul \u2014 who has more than 15 million followers on his YouTube channel \u2014 did not specify how long his break will last, but did tell Twitter followers \u201csee you soon.\u201d See his tweet below.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/logan-paul-sad-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0237/2843/products/2020_04_540x.jpg?v=1581608516", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c4=&cv=3.9&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/logan-paul-sad-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Rice", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow", "Class", "Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus", "Display Inline", ".Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Where Img", "Height Auto Max-Width", "Vertical-Align Bottom .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Coauthors.Is-Layout-Flow .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar", "Vertical-Align Middle .Wp-Block-Co-Authors-Plus-Avatar Is .Alignleft .Alignright"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/logan-paul-suicide-forest-video-controversy-youtube-break-tweet-8092550/", "title": "Logan Paul \u2018Taking Time to Reflect\u2019 After Suicide Forest Video Controversy", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#ffffff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The YouTube star tweeted that he would be taking a break from the popular video sharing site after the controversy he faced earlier this week.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.7.4", "author": "Nicholas Rice", "tags": "logan paul", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Logan Paul \u2018Taking Time to Reflect\u2019 After Suicide Forest Video Controversy", "url": "https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/logan-paul-suicide-forest-video-controversy-youtube-break-tweet-8092550/", "description": "The YouTube star tweeted that he would be taking a break from the popular video sharing site after the controversy he faced earlier this week.", "site_name": "Billboard", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/logan-paul-sad-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 677, "alt": "Logan Paul"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-04T16:37:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-04T20:25:46+00:00"}, "twitter": {"description": "The YouTube star tweeted that he would be taking a break from the popular video sharing site after the controversy he faced earlier this week.", "site": "@billboard", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Logan Paul \u2018Taking Time to Reflect\u2019 After Suicide Forest Video Controversy", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/logan-paul-sad-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515083833.0, "source": "https://www.billboard.com", "summary": ""}
