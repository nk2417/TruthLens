Just three days after 17-year-old Jacob Staudenmaier posted his viral La La Land-inspired promposal on Twitter, his celebrity crush, Emma Stone, responded with a heartfelt reply.\n\nStaudenmaier, a Phoenix, Arizona, native, read Stone\u2019s message on ABC\u2019s Good Morning America on Friday, April 7. The Oscar winner wrote: \u201cJacob, thanks for making the greatest proposal I have ever received. I can\u2019t tell you what an honor that was and how much I smiled through that entire beautifully orchestrated video. I\u2019m in London working, but I hope you have the best time at prom, and I\u2019m grateful you thought of me. Thank you. P.S. I do see Gosling around the eyes. Love, Emma.\u201d\n\nRelated: Watch This Ryan Gosling Lookalike Ask Emma Stone to Prom A Ryan Gosling look-alike asked \u2018La La Land\u2019 actress Emma Stone to prom in an epic video that he posted
