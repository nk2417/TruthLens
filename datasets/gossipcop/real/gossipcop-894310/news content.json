Lala Kent is best known as one of the breakout personalities on the Bravo series \"Vanderpump Rules,\" where her candid personality, evolving relationships, and journey through sobriety made her a fixture of the show's later seasons. Outside of television, she has appeared in numerous independent films, launched the successful beauty and skincare brands \"Give Them Lala Beauty\" and \"Give Them Lala Skin,\" and published the bestselling memoir \"Give Them Lala.\" Known for her honesty and entrepreneurial drive, Kent has become one of the most recognizable and influential figures in the Bravo universe.\n\nEarly Life\n\nLala Kent was born Lauren Elyse Burningham on September 2, 1990, in Salt Lake City, Utah. She was raised in a close-knit Mormon family by her parents, Lisa and Kent Burningham. Her father's death in 2018 had a profound impact on her life and later became one of the driving motivations behind her decision to become sober.\n\nCareer\n\nKent began acting in her early twenties, appearing in independent films such as \"Reflections in the Mud\" (2009), \"The Mentor\" (2014), \"One Shot\" (2014), and \"Pitching Love and Catching Faith\" (2015). Her big break came in 2015 when she joined the Bravo reality series \"Vanderpump Rules,\" which follows the employees of Lisa Vanderpump's West Hollywood restaurant, SUR. Initially hired as a hostess, Kent quickly became a central figure thanks to her outspoken personality and dramatic relationships with fellow cast members.\n\nWhile filming \"Vanderpump Rules,\" Kent also appeared in several movies, including \"The Row\" (2018), \"Vault\" (2019), \"10 Minutes Gone\" (2019), \"Trauma Center\" (2019), \"Spree\" (2020), \"Hard Kill\" (2020), \"The Estate\" (2020), and \"Out of Death\" (2021). Many of these projects were produced through Randall Emmett's company, Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films.\n\nKent's book \"Give Them Lala\" was released in 2021 and became a bestseller, praised for its raw honesty about fame, addiction, and relationships. Around the same time, she launched her hit podcast, also titled \"Give Them Lala,\" where she interviews celebrity guests and discusses motherhood, sobriety, and the realities of life in Hollywood\n\nBusiness Ventures\n\nIn 2017, Kent founded her cosmetics brand \"Give Them Lala Beauty,\" later expanding into skincare with \"Give Them Lala Skin\" in 2021. Both lines are cruelty-free and certified by PETA and Leaping Bunny. The brands sell products ranging from lip glosses and highlighters to serums and facial cleansers. She has since expanded into fragrance and children's products, building a loyal customer base through social media and her podcast audience.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn September 2018, Lala announced her engagement to producer Randall Emmett. The couple welcomed daughter Ocean on March 15, 2021, and they split up in October 2021.\n\nKent celebrated three years of sobriety on October 23, 2021, and she marked the occasion with an Instagram post stating \"Today marks 3 years of sobriety. I can't believe it. I'm beyond grateful for this path that God & my late father placed in front of me. I'm grateful for my sober coach & my sponsor who I consider angels. I'm grateful for the program & the men and women who have shared their stories so honestly, giving me hope and inspiration to continue to never pick up a drink again. It is one day at a time, but I will say, I have never felt so strong in my sobriety. It's the proudest thing I have ever done, aside from becoming a mother.\"\n\nIn her book, \"Give Them Lala,\" Kent revealed that she had an abortion when she was 22 years old because \"it was not the right situation to bring an innocent life into.\" She told \"People\" magazine, \"I feel like we are where we are in this world because people are so nervous to talk about things that make them uncomfortable. So we're mentioning it, we're talking about it and people can love it, hate it, or learn something from it.\"\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn April 2024, Kent purchased a $3.1 million home in Sherman Oaks, California. The 4,000-square-foot property features four bedrooms, five bathrooms, and a pool. She previously lived in a Bel-Air mansion shared with Randall Emmett, which was listed for $6.3 million in 2022 following their breakup and ultimately sold in late 2024 for $4.3 million.", "images": ["https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/1JoH3482haSLevnlEMdqhrz36y0=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/11/George-Clooney.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/uRsxoLs7Ymmit5ATgRtN2utad40=/221x5:381x236/132x132/filters:format(webp):strip_exif()/2009/09/P-Diddy.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/-6uCap9AXm-QVSgjd29bMj2W8-k=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2023/08/Katie-Maloney.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/KNDSqD-9inbRekV6AGgXDEG2Scw=/375x35:810x586/132x132/filters:format(webp):strip_exif()/2015/09/GettyImages-476575299.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/themes/cnw_2023/svg/logo.svg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/-faJddx3ibX6TMGJFFyQhiNl0DE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2010/10/Lisa-Vanderpump-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/jdSGaNDxOmQColEz4ZzkHS_ihxo=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2023/10/Kristen-Doute.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/A3w6UILOYqSBhYZDXsXK2i7YdqU=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2017/05/Randall-Emmett-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/0dOqT2nlNQM7u_J-5xWrCsf2nAw=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/02/Angelina-Jolie.png", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/_hOmdPz8Ht24ZxIeZM7m4mGRouk=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/11/GettyImages-1094653148.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/CtUCxL0coIyVwqHDx5Jhnsw4btU=/600x300/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2022/02/Lala-Kent.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/Y14fttV9jls9mxFLuNAHJTnNWTE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/10/denzel-washington-1.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/yboGsO77E1kQwELLmrwRZv_4RmE=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2017/02/GettyImages-528215436.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/lt1abKKVHSBtY-US0k9GLU9MTmM=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/09/Brad-Pitt.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/UxnQSql1h0QyX1CgkPqKhTxCTHM=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2009/09/Jennifer-Aniston.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/kHmar6i49WAvu3EickjJTEVLvx8=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/04/bc.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/95i5RI1LWkjHyyoolMeto-z_WeU=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2020/01/lopez3.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thm/KFAqJ9F4o80l6an2fe78-0jw28s=/132x132/center/top/filters:format(webp)/2019/04/rr.jpg", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Lala-Kent.jpg?x46379", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript"], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Lala-Kent.jpg?x46379", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/models/lala-kent-net-worth/", "title": "Lala Kent Net Worth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Lala Kent is an American reality television personality, actress, author, and entrepreneur who has a net worth of $4 million.
