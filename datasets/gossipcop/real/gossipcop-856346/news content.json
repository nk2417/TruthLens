These scores will help determine who wins Season 24 of the ABC network competition Tuesday.\n\n\u201cEveryone has their own personal best and it looks different obviously, but tonight I definitely feel you hit your personal best. Thank you for giving us the freestyle we wanted,\u201d judge Carrie Ann Inaba told Ross and Arnold.\n\nThis was the first time the pair earned 10s from the judges. Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t fare as well in their first dance of the night, the Viennese waltz, because of Ross\u2019 technical flaws.\n\n\u201cDavid, I\u2019ve got to say, first, congratulations on making it through to the final. It\u2019s a truly Cinderella story. I never dreamt you\u2019d make it to the ball, but here you are,\u201d judge Len Goodman said. \u201cThere is improvement in your dancing overall, but for me, not so much in the Viennese waltz.\u201d\n\nRoss and Arnold are at the bottom of the leaderboard because of the waltz score. NFL running back Rashad Jennings and partner Emma Slater scored 80 out of 80 points Monday, while singer Normani Kordei and pro dancer Valentin Chmerkovskiy earned 78 points.\n\nBut the pairs are not done dancing. On Tuesday, each couple will fuse two contrasting dance styles they\u2019ve performed this season for judges\u2019 points. The pairs have less than 24 hours to prepare for that dance.\n\nViewer votes and judges\u2019 points from last week and Monday will be combined with judges\u2019 points from the Tuesday 24-hour challenge to determine the winner of the mirror-ball trophy.\n\nRoss acknowledged Monday that he made it to the finals not because of the judges\u2019 scores, but via support from his fans and former teammates.\n\n\u201cJust being in the finals, one, is way more than I ever expected and the fact that I\u2019ve got support from so many great people, and that they look up to me and watch this show and support me, just \u2026 I don\u2019t even have the words, just a lot of thanks,\u201d Ross said.\n\nTuesday\u2019s two-and-a-half-hour finale is scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nCubs\u2019 David Ross to dance to \u2018Take Me Out to the Ball Game\u2019 in \u2018Dancing with the Stars\u2019 finals\n\nDid Cubs\u2019 David Ross foxtrot into the \u2018Dancing with the Stars\u2019 finals?\n\nDavid Ross\u2019 ESPN debut: Too much \u2018Dancing,\u2019 not enough baseball\n\nShould Chris Pratt play Cubs\u2019 David Ross in movie about Ross\u2019 life?\n\nDavid Ross on his new book: \u2018I didn\u2019t want to write (it)\u2019\n\nCould Cubs\u2019 David Ross waltz into the \u2018Dancing with the Stars\u2019 semifinals?\n\nDid Cubs\u2019 David Ross survive double elimination on \u2018Dancing with the Stars\u2019?\n\n.galleries:after {\n\ncontent: \u201d;\n\ndisplay: block;\n\nbackground-color: #144A7C;\n\nmargin: 16px auto 0;\n\nheight: 5px;\n\nwidth: 100px;\n\n}\n\n.galleries:before {\n\ncontent: \u201cEntertainment Photos and Video\u201d;\n\ndisplay: block;\n\nfont: 700 20px Georgia,serif;\n\ntext-align: center;\n\ncolor: #1e1e1e;\n\nvar playlist = \u2018chi_ent_movie_trailers\u2019,\n\nlayout = \u2018autoblurb\u2019,\n\niu = \u2018%2F4011%2Ftrb.chicagotribune%2Fent\u2019;\n\nWatch the latest movie trailers.", "images": ["data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiQAAABXRUJQVlA4IBgAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEAAwA0JaQAA3AA/v3AgAA=", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2560px-Chicago_Tribune_Logo.svg-1.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=85&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/05/23/2M5VNZTFGZFHPHID34WVXAOYMI.jpg?w=1024&h=670"], "top_img": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/migration/2017/05/23/2M5VNZTFGZFHPHID34WVXAOYMI.jpg?w=1024&h=670", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tracy Swartz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2017/05/22/cubs-david-ross-finally-hits-it-out-of-the-park-on-dancing-with-the-stars/", "title": "Cubs\u2019 David Ross finally hits it out of the park on \u2018Dancing with the Stars\u2019", "meta_data": {"application-name": "chicagotribune", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msvalidate.01": "4B535F7EB2971D1FCBA5D1D3E3E292C3", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "tdm-reservation": 1, "mrf": {"authors": "Tracy Swartz", "canonical": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/2017/05/22/cubs-david-ross-finally-hits-it-out-of-the-park-on-dancing-with-the-stars/"}, "description": "With another championship on the line, retired Cubs catcher David Ross finally hit a home run with the \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d judges Monday.
